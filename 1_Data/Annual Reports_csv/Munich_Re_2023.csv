Last year was very good for Munich Re."
"We managed to surpass our profit 
target for the third consecutive year."
"With a net result of €4.6bn, your 
company earned €600m more than we had initially planned for 2023."
"We would like you to benefit accordingly from this success, as in years past."
"Subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be 
significantly increased by €3.40 to €15 per share – raising the bar to a new 
level."
"We have also approved a new, larger share buy-back with a volume of 
€1.5bn."
"The year 2023 thus marks the latest pinnacle in the creation of value on 
behalf of our shareholders."
"After all, we have returned €22.9bn of capital to 
our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buy-backs over the 
past ten years."
That is an average of €2.29bn every year.
"Our balance sheet 
and capital position remain very strong."
"Hence all strategic and financial 
options with regard to growth, investments, and dividend payouts are open 
to us."
Our solvency ratio of 267% remains above the optimum range.
"We are just past the halfway point of our five-year Ambition 2025 strategic 
programme, which defines our medium-term financial targets for the 
financial years 2021–2025."
"While maintaining a sound capital base, by  
the end of 2025 we aim to achieve a return on equity of 14–16% and boost 
both earnings per share and the dividend by an average of at least 5% 
annually."
Our return on equity in 2023 already amounted to 15.7%.
"Since 
2021, earnings per share have grown annually by almost 20% on average."
"Our dividend has increased by an average of about 15% each year in the 
same period."

Chair of Munich Reinsurance 
Company’s Board of Management 
 
 
To our shareholders

Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
The capital markets have been rewarding our excellent performance."
"During 
the first three years of Ambition 2025, our share price rose by almost 60%."
"During that same period, the German stock market index (DAX) increased by 
only 22%."
"What’s more, Munich Re’s share price topped €400 for the first 
time ever in 2023, for a new historical high."
"In terms of total shareholder 
return, which comprises income from share price increases and dividends, 
we have further extended our lead over the competition over a span of 
several years."
"Of the eight leading reinsurers and primary insurers in Europe, 
none has created more value for shareholders in the 2020s than Munich Re."
Our Group is in excellent shape – but the world is not.
"Recent years have 
been marred by a multitude of simultaneous major crises, which have taken 
a toll on the insurance industry, too."
"Our planning phase for Ambition 2025 
coincided with the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which subsequently 
impacted us heavily in 2021, the initial year of our five-year strategy 
programme."
"War then broke out in Ukraine in 2022, unleashing economic 
turbulence in the form of volatile capital markets, extreme rates of inflation 
and an abrupt rise in interest rates."
"These new and immediate threats nearly 
overshadowed climate change – despite devastating natural disasters 
plaguing the planet, such as the flooding in Germany’s Ahr valley in summer 
2021 and Hurricane Ian in the United States in autumn 2022."
"The year 2023 was sadly no exception, particularly in the wake of the 
earthquake in Turkey and Syria."
"Some 74,000 people lost their lives in natural 
disasters last year, far exceeding the long-term average."
"While inflation eased 
considerably last year, it remains far above the target rate associated with 
price stability."
"Geopolitical tensions rose anew in 2023, with the escalation 
in the Middle East being the latest example."
"People in Ukraine have been 
enduring destruction and suffering for over two years."
"And then there is the 
perennial crisis regarding Taiwan between global superpowers China and 
the United States."
"Any one of these wars or conflicts could spread beyond 
its current boundaries, erupting into something with an unforeseeable 
outcome as well as massive humanitarian and economic consequences."
There is a significant amount of uncertainty.
We have coped well with all of the above-mentioned external shocks so far.
"Atop a solid foundation, Munich Re reliably generates high income."
"To our shareholders 
5 
 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
In 2023, the ERGO field of business achieved its annual target by generating 
a net result of around €720m."
"In international business, ERGO earned much 
more insurance revenue than in 2022 – chiefly due to growth in property-
casualty insurance business in Poland and the good performance of health 
business in Belgium and Spain."
"In addition, the full consolidation of ERGO’s 
property-casualty business in Thailand also helped boost insurance 
revenue."
"Insurance revenue likewise rose in the Property-casualty Germany 
segment, particularly on account of third-party liability and motor insurance 
business."
"In the ERGO Life and Health Germany segment, supplementary 
and travel insurance in particular contributed to renewed revenue growth."
"Moreover, demand remained high for biometric risk cover and capital-
efficient investment solutions."
"ERGO’s altogether positive business development is reflected on the 
customer side, too."
"Regular surveys indicate that customer satisfaction has 
improved in recent years, and 2023 was no exception."
"Customers awarded 
ERGO the highest scores for the processing of insurance claims and policy 
benefits."
"Our reinsurance field of business achieved a result of about €3.9bn in 
2023."
"The property-casualty reinsurance segment was again impacted  
by high natural catastrophe losses."
"A relatively low-impact hurricane 
season notwithstanding, insured losses from natural catastrophes totalled 
US$ 95bn; the ten-year annual average amounts to US$ 90bn."
"Conversely, 
we benefitted from the ongoing hard market."
"Not only did we achieve higher 
margins; we also managed to further grow our business."
"The new Global Specialty Insurance (GSI) division, established in 2023, 
helped to boost both our insurance revenue and net result."
"In addition, life 
and health reinsurance business continued to develop very favourably as 
regards both the assumption of biometric risks and financially motivated 
reinsurance solutions – particularly those that provide financing and capital 
relief for cedants."
"This segment’s total technical result amounted to just 
over €1.4bn, far outperforming the initial guidance of €1.0bn."
Our reinsurance clients hold us in high esteem.
"We have performed better 
and better for years now on our net promoter score, which is an industry-
wide gauge of client satisfaction that we calculate every two years as part 
of our worldwide client survey."
"In short, we excel thanks to our reliability, 
predictability, consistency in action, and our dependability in making solid 
capacity available."
"To our shareholders 
6 
 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
The excellent business developments in (re)insurance have granted us 
additional investment flexibility."
"We deliberately realised losses on the 
disposal of fixed-interest securities in 2023 in order to benefit more quickly 
from higher interest rates upon reinvestment, thus boosting future investment 
income."
"As a result, the reinvestment yield rose from 2.8% in 2022 to 4.5% 
in 2023, with the return on investment improving from 2.1% to 2.5%."
"In short, Munich Re is in an outstanding position to fully meet all its 
Ambition 2025 targets."
"Momentum remains positive this year, with the 
January 2024 renewals sustaining the years-long trend of gratifying treaty 
renewals."
"As a result, we managed to keep profitability levels high and 
prices stable overall."
"Premium growth amounted to 3.5%; we wrote more 
business only when we could tap into attractive opportunities."
"We also 
actively discontinued business that no longer met our expectations with 
regard to pricing or conditions."
"In light of sustained good business performance, we want to further grow 
our net result."
Our profit target for 2024 is €5bn.
"We expect the Group’s 
insurance revenue to total €59bn and the return on investment to improve 
markedly, surpassing 2.8%."
"In addition to the pursuit of financial success, fundamental components  
of our business activities include environmental, social and corporate 
governance (ESG) considerations."
"We strive to meet our ESG targets with 
the same determination with which we pursue our financial objectives."
"In this context, we devote ourselves to two matters in particular as part of 
our Ambition 2025 programme: increasing the percentage of women in 
management and decarbonising our investment and insurance portfolios."
"Thanks to continual improvements over the past three years, we have  
nearly met the target we set ourselves for 2025, i.e."
"40% of management 
positions within the Group being held by women."
"By the end of 2023, this 
figure had reached 39.5%."
"We also made considerable progress last year  
on decarbonisation."
"For our investments, the 
reduction remained high, at 47%."
"We once again expanded our investments 
in renewable energies, significantly boosting our investment volume from 
€2.4bn in 2022 to €3.1bn in 2023."
"To our shareholders 
7 
 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Simply put, the first three years of the five-year Ambition 2025 programme 
have been very encouraging in every regard."
"Our nearly 43,000 staff 
members worldwide will keep on working hard to ensure that Munich Re 
meets all its Ambition 2025 commitments by the end of next year."
"We are 
all optimistic that we will succeed."
"I wish to thank you, dear shareholders, for the trust you place in our Group."
"This model 
enables us to pool our industry-wide areas of expertise, 
share underlying know-how and data, and leverage synergies 
through risk diversification."
"At the core of our business model, Munich Re is the risk 
carrier along the entire insurance value chain."
"We are 
happy to expand our primary insurance activities on the 
basis of their stable earnings and have a strategic interest 
in new business models."
"We prefer organic growth, but will 
engage in selected M&A activities in line with our strategic 
preferences."
"Our active, integrated capital management 
and risk management across the Group helps to create 
economic value for our shareholders, while safeguarding 
the fulfilment of our obligations towards clients and 
policyholders as well as protecting the reputation of 
Munich Re."
"Our strategy follows the three guiding principles of Scale, 
Shape, and Succeed, which are key pillars of the Munich Re 
Group Ambition 2025."
"Scale 
Scale represents growth in the Group’s core business."
"There are opportunities for organic growth, particularly  
in reinsurance and specialty primary insurance within 
reinsurance, owing to recent improvements in market 
conditions."
"In asset management, we want to enhance 
performance and further optimise our risk-return profile  
in a setting characterised by higher interest rates."
"Shape 
Shape stands for Munich Re’s mission to develop new 
business models that are aligned with our core business 
throughout the value chain, in turn shaping markets."
"In this 
environment, innovative and digital solutions will give rise 
to additional business opportunities."
"Succeed 
Succeed symbolises the added value that Munich Re 
generates for all its stakeholders."
"For shareholders,  
this means the sustained financial success of their 
investments in Munich Re."
"Clients benefit from bespoke 
products."
"And for staff, Succeed connotes appealing long-
term employment and good career prospects."
"A particular 
priority concerns women in management: by 2025, 40%  
of managers below the Board of Management are to be 
women."
"Last but not least, Succeed allows communities  
to benefit from, in particular, the Group’s climate targets  
in its asset management, (re)insurance business and in its 
own business operations."
"2 
In addition: dividend floor of at least previous year’s DPS."
"We want to generate an attractive return on equity (RoE)1 
which, following the application of new IFRS reporting 
standards, should be between 14% and 16% by 2025."
"The 
higher RoE achieved in the course of the strategy period to

from increased profitability, growth, and an improved return 
on investment."

Strategy 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Continued earnings growth is poised to translate into 
higher earnings per share, with a targeted average annual 
rise of 5% or more by 2025."
"The implicit dividend commitment of recent decades is 
now an explicit target of the Munich Re Group Ambition 
2025: in “normal” years, the dividend per share is to rise by 
5% or more on average, similarly to the increase in earnings 
per share."
"In years with unusually high claims expenditure, 
it is expected that the dividend per share will at least remain 
the same."
"We consider the optimum range for the solvency ratio to be 
175% to 220%."
"As an environmentally conscientious business, Munich Re 
endeavours to play its part in meeting the targets of the 
Paris Agreement."
"The Group has therefore set itself medium- 
and long-term decarbonisation targets for its investments, 
its (re)insurance transactions and its own business 
operations."
"The description of our Climate Ambition provided 
here is a brief summary."
"All details are presented in the 
Combined management report > Combined non-financial 
statement."
Base year for all target and achievement figures is 2019.
Exceptions to the guidelines can only be approved by Board of Management committees.

"12 Metric tonnes of thermal coal produced annually by insureds/installed operational capacity (in megawatts) of insured coal-fired power plants of insureds  
(used as an equivalent for an approximate development of the GHG emissions of our insureds’ business)."
"13 Operational property covers, scope 1–3 life-cycle emissions."
"14 Scope 1, 2 and 3(business trips, paper, water, waste)."
"Our goal is to decarbonise our investment and (re)insurance 
portfolio, reaching net zero by 2050."
"We have committed to 
completely phase out the (re)insurance of thermal coal 
activities altogether in our primary insurance and facultative 
and direct (re)insurance business – and in our investment 
portfolio – by 2040."
"This includes reducing, in an intermediate 
step, our total scope 1 and 2 financed GHG emissions from 
listed equities, corporate bonds and direct real estate by 
25% to 29% compared to the 2019 base year, by 2025."
"In 2019, Munich Re stopped investing directly in listed 
companies that generate more than 30% of their earnings 
from thermal coal."
"Since 2021, companies that generate 
15% to 30% of their earnings from thermal coal have  
also been excluded from our investment universe or, in 
individual cases, encouraged to reduce their greenhouse 
gases in the context of an engagement dialogue."
"Direct 
investments in listed companies that generate more than 
10% of their earnings from oil sands are also excluded."
"Munich Re set itself its own emissions-reduction targets  
in 2020 with respect to thermal coal and oil and gas 
production in our primary insurance and facultative and 
direct (re)insurance business."
"This also encompasses 
treaty-like business in the form of facultative facilities if it 
includes the option to decline individual risks."
"In an initial 
phase, we aim to reduce emissions from oil and gas 
production by 5% by 2025, compared to the base year 
2019."
"Munich Re will also reduce its coal-related exposure 
in its direct and facultative insurance business by 35% 
Group-wide by 2025, compared to the base year 2019."
"Munich Re stopped insuring new coal-fired power plants 
and coal mines in 2018 – and oil sands sites in 2019."
"Under the Munich Re Group Ambition 2025, we also set 
targets regarding our own GHG emissions from business 
operations."
"GHG emissions are to be reduced by 12% per 
employee between the base year 2019 and 2025."
"Five years 
later, in 2030, our target is to achieve GHG net zero for the 
remaining GHG emissions from our own operations."
"We will 
endeavour to offset these GHG emissions by purchasing 
certificates for projects that aim to remove GHGs from the 
atmosphere (GHG net zero)."
"Reinsurance 
Munich Re’s strategic aim is to expand its position as a 
leading global reinsurer and, by means of Global Specialty 
Insurance, to further consolidate our success in specialty 
primary insurance business through our special underwriting 
expertise."
"Our reinsurance strategy likewise relies on the three  
pillars of Scale, Shape, Succeed – which define measures 
for achieving overarching objectives."
"In traditional reinsurance, Munich Re is participating in  
the marked expansion of significant markets."
"Growth areas 
in our core business include the expansion of the market 
position in developed markets in North America, Europe, 
Asia and Australia – with a focus on risk expertise and 
underwriting quality."
"In the emerging markets of Asia, the 
Middle East and South America, Munich Re focuses on 
targeted growth, in particular by offering bespoke services 
and products for cedants."
"The bundling of activities in the division Global Specialty 
Insurance aims to bring about a stringent market and broker 
strategy, as well as the consistent management of units 
that previously operated independently, such as American 
Modern Insurance Group Inc."
"(American Modern), the 
Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company 
(HSB), Munich Re Specialty Insurance (MRSI), Munich Re 
Syndicate and Aerospace, and Great Lakes Insurance SE 
(GLISE)."
"In this regard, Munich Re’s goals are to create 
synergies in underwriting, sales and digitalisation, while 
also more effectively addressing the increased regulatory 
requirements for primary insurance business through its 
new positioning."
"Munich Re’s long-term competitiveness in traditional 
reinsurance and speciality primary insurance is particularly 
sustained by excellence in operations, the development of 
new product solutions, and the pursuit of new strategic 
options in our business activities."
"Both traditional reinsurance and Global Specialty Insurance 
are constantly defining new topic areas and solutions to 
further develop the business."
"For example, Munich Re is 
driving forward product innovations for cyber, flooding, 
parametric covers, credit insurance and financially 
motivated reinsurance by offering data-driven solutions 
and services under third-party brands, alongside its own 
reinsurance covers."
"Data and AI are playing an increasingly important role in 
both specialty primary insurance and traditional reinsurance, 
principally in the form of AI-supported decision-making in 
reinsurance – especially in underwriting – and in terms of 
process automation and efficiency gains."
"Generative AI in 
particular opens up new opportunities to harness the 
potential of external data using pre-trained models and 
enables the quality of internal data to be improved through 
AI-supported data management."
"In reinsurance, our AI 
approach is complemented by our data strategy, which 
enables data products to be provided in line with the needs 
of our business units."
"Along with investing in innovation and digitalisation 
projects, the reinsurance field of business also operates  
as a venture capitalist."
"Beyond the objective of generating 
especially profitable returns on investment, the reinsurance 
field of business deploys venture capital to ensure the 
closest possible proximity to new technologies and emerging 
business models."
"ERGO 
ERGO’s strategic aim is to continue growing profitably 
through 2025 and, as regards return on equity (RoE), to 
become one of the top primary insurers in Europe."
"To this 
end, ERGO’s portfolio of strategic measures likewise relies 
on the three pillars of Scale – Shape – Succeed, which define 
steps for achieving overarching objectives."
"In international 
business, ERGO concentrates on Europe and Asia, where 
high-growth markets such as India, China and Thailand 
offer particularly promising opportunities."
"The ever-increasing changes in markets caused by digital 
transformation and new patterns of customer behaviour 
demand flexibility in both services and products."
"In this 
context, ERGO is focusing consistently on the needs of its 
customers, who are increasingly using traditional and digital 
channels in parallel when seeking advice and purchasing 
insurance products."
"The ongoing modernisation of IT infrastructures continues 
to play a key role here."
"In addition, ERGO is seeking a 
leading role in digitalisation by consistently driving forward 
traditional and generative AI, metaverse technology, 
robotics and voice technology, with an eye to continually 
enhancing customer experience."
"ERGO aims at further 
increasing its competitive strength by transferring 
technology-based solutions and enhancing cross-border 
synergies."
"ERGO will continue to rely on external and 
internal resources in generating innovative business ideas 
to further expand the business model along the entire 
insurance value chain and unlock growth potential in the 
digital world."
"This is the aim of our active capital management 
and the consistent application of value- and risk-based 
management systems."
"The framework for any business activity is our risk strategy, 
from which we derive various limitations and reporting 
thresholds."
"Our economic capital resources, which we 
determine in accordance with the Solvency II supervisory 
regime, are a key element."
"We monitor a range of important 
additional conditions."
"These include national accounting 
regulations, tax aspects, liquidity requirements, supervisory 
parameters, and rating agency requirements."
"Our value-based management is characterised by the 
following aspects: 
− Risk capital, i.e."
"the capital required to cover the risks, is 
the basis of our value- and risk-based management."
"The 
capital requirement corresponds to the solvency capital 
requirement under Solvency II, as determined on the basis 
of our certified internal risk model."
"Information on the 
internal model is provided in the Risk report > Risk 
governance and risk management system > Risks depicted 
in the internal model."
"− Consequently, business activities are assessed not only 
according to their earnings potential, but also relative to 
the extent of the risks assumed."
"Only the risk-return 
relationship reveals how beneficial an activity is from the 
point of view of our shareholders."
"− With value-based corporate management tools, we 
ensure an economic valuation and the comparability of 
alternative initiatives."
"Contrasting aspects have to be evaluated when selecting 
suitable target figures."
"On the one hand, the often-complex 
economic environment should be reflected as realistically 
as possible in order to emphasise added value as the 
Group’s overriding guiding principle."
"On the other hand, 
targets should be straightforward and understandable for 
investors, staff, and the public."
"The Group’s corporate management 
tools 
Our key corporate management tools at Group level are 
economic earnings and the IFRS net result."
"Together with 
the other performance indicators, they constitute the most 
important financial indicators of relevance for us."
"With  
the introduction of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, the Group’s IFRS 
accounting provides a more accurate reflection of 
economic earnings, and therefore, greater transparency  
for our stakeholders."
"Economic earnings 
The starting point for value-based management is the 
economic value added, which we determine based on the 
key corporate management tool of economic earnings."
"These earnings correspond with the change in eligible  
own funds under Solvency II, adjusted for items that do  
not represent economic value added – such as capital 
measures, and the change in regulatory restrictions."
"In particular, economic earnings comprise the contribution 
to profits from our new business, and changes in the value 
of in-force business against the previous year’s assessment 
on account of technical factors."
"The development of eligible 
own funds is also considered because of the effect of 
capital market parameters on the assets and liabilities sides 
of the solvency balance sheet."
"With respect to the management of economic value added, 
we use conceptually consistent value-based and risk-capital-
based measurement approaches that are individually 
geared to the characteristics of each respective field of 
business."
"Our approach for property-casualty reinsurance 
is based on the adjusted result, which comprises the 
anticipated discounted cash flows of underwriting and an 
adjustment for major claims."
"In life and health reinsurance, 
we apply value added by new business and the change in 
value of in-force business, which are based on the solvency 
balance sheet."
"As part of our asset-liability management, 
 
 
Combined management report 
17 
Tools of corporate management and strategic financial objectives 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
we consider the excess return from our investment 
operations in reinsurance."
"The management tool of 
economic earnings is used directly for ERGO."
"IFRS net result 
We use the IFRS net result as a standardised, accounting-
based benchmark for the Group and its fields of business."
"The standardised approach of the IFRS net result makes  
it easier for outsiders to understand and interpret the 
information in it; as such, it is a pivotal part of our financial 
reporting in capital markets."
"Other performance indicators 
Insurance revenue from insurance contracts 
issued (insurance revenue) 
Insurance revenue is a key indicator for corporate growth, 
both at Group level and for the individual fields of business."
"However, increases in this performance metric are not  
an inherently meaningful target for our Group, as we  
must always consider revenue growth as it relates to the 
profitability of the business we write."
"Combined ratio 
The combined ratio is regularly posted for property-casualty 
business."
"Calculated as the percentage ratio of insurance 
service expenses and insurance revenue (both of which are 
net, i.e."
"after reinsurance cessions), the combined ratio is 
the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio."
"A combined 
ratio of 100% means that insurance revenue was sufficient to 
cover claims and costs.1 Given that the combined ratio takes 
into account the time value of money and the uncertainty of 
future cash flows, it can also be used to assess economic 
profitability."
"It is only of limited suitability for comparing the 
financial performance of competitors owing to differing 
calculation methods and portfolio mixes."
"Generally, we aim 
to keep the combined ratio as low as possible by means of 
good underwriting and claims management."
"1 
Details on determining the combined ratio can be found in the Notes to the 
consolidated financial statements > Explanatory information > Segment 
disclosures > 7 Alternative performance measures."
"Total technical result for life and health 
reinsurance 
Owing to the long-term nature of business in life and 
health reinsurance, the combined ratio used in property-
casualty insurance is only of limited use in this segment."
"We therefore track and post the total technical result  
under IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 for life and health reinsurance."
"It consistently combines underwriting business with 
insurance-related financial instruments and, with effect 
from this reporting year, supersedes the “technical result 
including the result from reinsurance contracts with non-
significant risk transfer” under IFRS 4."
"Return on investment (RoI) 
This is a key indicator of investment performance for 
Munich Re, on the basis of external reporting."
"Given the 
longer time horizon of several years and the correspondingly 
greater uncertainties, the result targets published for  
these performance indicators take the form of anticipated 
corridors or minimum targets only."

Return on equity (RoE) 
The RoE is an important profitability KPI, which is of 
relevance in particular in the medium term."
"It is calculated 
on the basis of the IFRS result in relation to the average 
IFRS equity at the beginning and end of the year."
"IFRS 
equity is adjusted in particular for the fair value reserve, the 
foreign currency translation reserve, the insurance finance 
reserve (from the measurement of insurance contracts) and 
the reserve from hedging relationships."
"Further adjustments 
are made to eliminate distortions attributable to intra-Group 
transactions."
The RoE is significantly influenced by the IFRS result.
"IFRS 
equity is affected by profits as well as by capital measures 
such as dividend payments and share buy-backs, in 
particular."
"The RoE is recognised for the Group and for the 
reinsurance and ERGO fields of business."
"The calculation of the return on equity and the  
adjustments applied to average equity remain unaffected 
by the introduction of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17."
"Earnings per share 
The earnings per share figure reflects the IFRS net result 
for a year in relation to the average number of outstanding 
shares at the beginning and end of the year."
"The earnings 
per share is primarily influenced by the IFRS net result."
"The number of outstanding shares can change as a result 
of share buy-backs or other capital measures."
"Further 
information on the earnings per share is available in the 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Explanatory 
information > Other information > 66 Earnings per share."
"Dividend per share 
The dividend per share reflects the dividends paid for one 
year in relation to the number of dividend-bearing shares."
"The number of shares can change as a result of share buy-
backs or other capital measures."
"Solvency ratio under Solvency II 
The solvency ratio under Solvency II is the ratio of the 
eligible own funds to the solvency capital requirement."
"Information on solvency capital requirements and eligible 
own funds is available in the Risk report."

Macroeconomic and industry environment 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Macroeconomic and 
industry environment 
Global economic growth weakened slightly in 2023, owing 
mainly to high inflation and restrictive monetary policy."
"Economic momentum waned considerably, particularly in 
Europe."
"By contrast, the US economy remained surprisingly 
strong, and China’s economy grew faster year on year 
following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions."
"Rates of 
inflation fell thanks to lower energy prices, but average 
inflation rates for the year were still significantly above the 
long-term average in many countries."
"Capital markets 
In response to persistently high inflation, key central banks 
further tightened monetary policy in 2023."
"Over the course 
of the year, the Federal Reserve in the United States raised 
its policy rate by 100 basis points, with the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5% in December 2023."
"In addition, it further reduced its securities holdings."
"The 
European Central Bank raised its interest rate on the main 
refinancing operations from 2.5% to 4.5%."
"It also began 
reducing its securities holdings, a product of the asset 
purchasing programme it launched in 2014."
"Yields on ten-
year government bonds in the United States and Germany 
reached their highest levels in years in 2023."
"Growing 
expectations that central banks would soon cut rates, 
however, contributed to a drop in yields in Q4."
"By the end of 
December, yields on US bonds had returned to the same 
level as at the beginning of the year, while those on German 
bonds were down slightly."
"Important 
equity indices rose significantly in 2023, including the 
US Dow Jones Industrial Average and the EURO STOXX 50."

On the currency markets, fluctuations were also less 
pronounced in 2023 than in the previous year."
"At the end  
of December, the US dollar and Canadian dollar were 
somewhat lower against the euro, while the Japanese yen 
was significantly lower."
"The pound sterling was up against 
the euro."
"The annual average values against the euro, 
however, were lower in 2023 than in 2022 for the above-
mentioned currencies."
"At €0.92, the average value of the 
US dollar in the reporting year was slightly lower than in 
the previous year (€0.95)."
"Insurance industry 
According to current extrapolations, premium income in  
the German insurance sector saw only weak growth in 
2023."
"While premium income growth in property-casualty 
insurance was above the long-term average, life insurance 
premiums decreased due to a further slump in single 
premiums."
"On a global level, a number of major property-casualty 
primary insurance markets experienced strong growth  
in 2023 – resulting in a substantial increase in global 
premium income, even when adjusted for high inflation."
"Overall, the trend toward higher prices continued in the 
renewal rounds for property-casualty reinsurance 
contracts."
"However, this trend varied significantly among 
regions and classes of business – depending on claims 
experience, loss expectations and the individual market 
situation."

Strategy and objectives 
As global investors, Munich Re is aware of its responsibility

criteria into our investment policy."
"In addition, we have 
committed to moving our portfolio towards a net-zero 
climate target by 2050."
"When choosing asset managers,  
we take their level of experience in ESG and integrating 
ESG aspects into account."
"All of our measures are aimed  
at identifying ESG-related risks and opportunities, and 
including them in our investment decisions."
"Munich Re was one of the first signatories of the Principles 
for Responsible Investment (PRI) and joined the Net-Zero 
Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) in 2022."
"Based on these 
two programmes, we have introduced our Responsible 
Investment Guideline, which covers the PRI, NZAOA and 
the sustainability criteria that we apply to our investment 
management."
"Moreover, Munich Re is a member of the 
Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), 
whose recommendations we take into account in our 
investment activities and in our insurance business."
"As outlined in further detail under “Governance”, our 
strategic decisions on sustainability in investment are taken 
by the Board of Management’s ESG Committee, supported 
by the ESG Management Team."
"The Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is the Board member 
responsible for the Group’s investment management."
"Group Investment Management (GIM), which reports to the 
CIO, is responsible for the sustainability of the Group’s 
investment strategy as the asset owner, and has set up its 
own ESG team for this purpose."
"ESG multipliers throughout 
GIM support the ESG team in establishing sustainability as 
an important consideration throughout the entire value chain."
"This structure is also reflected in asset management at 
MEAG, which handles the majority of our investments."
"MEAG 
ensures targeted implementation of the ESG strategy 
through its membership on GIM’s ESG Investment 
Committee, ongoing coordination among the ESG teams, 
and the ESG multipliers in the various portfolio-management 
teams."
"Regular training is offered to increase and improve 
awareness of ESG issues, for example on regulatory topics 
or ESG trends."

reducing, in an intermediate step, our total scope 1 and 2 
financed GHG emissions1 from listed equities, corporate 
bonds and direct real estate by 25–29% compared to the

progress made, with GIM."
"In 2023, MEAG joined 12 further 
engagement groups, resulting in a total number of 
22 contributions."
"One of these engagements came to an 
end in 2023, after CA100+ established that the company

"The MSCI ESG rating coverage of the liquid 
asset classes equity, corporate and government bonds, and 
covered bonds is over 80%."
"As part of our PRI membership, Munich Re builds on its 
sustainability strategy by engaging in regular dialogue  
with the PRI managers."
"PRI carried out a further assessment 
process in 2023 in which Munich Re participated."
"Metrics 
In order to meet our environmental objectives, we determine 
metrics based on the goals of the Munich Re Group 
Ambition 2025."
"The defined metrics are all shown compared 
to the 2019 base year."
"Any additional metrics are shown in 
comparison to the previous year."
"The following table illustrates the development of scope 1 
and 2 financed GHG emissions from listed equities, 
corporate bonds and direct real estate."
"We use data from 
the external provider ISS ESG to measure the financed 
GHG emissions from listed equities and corporate bonds."
"To measure GHG emissions for our direct real estate 
portfolio, we continue to record energy consumption data, 
which is subsequently converted using emission factors."

"For 
direct real estate, CO2e emissions for the 2023 reporting year are approximated

"They are based on 
available CO2e emissions from the previous year and CO2e-emission reductions 
as a result of implemented energy-saving measures, provided they can be verified 
and measured."

"They are based on 
available CO2e emissions from the previous year and CO2e-emission reductions 
as a result of implemented energy-saving measures, provided they can be verified 
and measured."
"Regarding the total absolute financed GHG emissions,  
+0.2 (+0.5) percentage points of the year-on-year change 
were attributable to updated emissions data that we received 
from our data provider."
"Interest-rate changes on the markets lead to an adjustment 
in the market value of debt instruments and thus in total 
absolute financed GHG emissions."
"If we were to use the 
nominal value instead of the market value for debt 
instruments, the reduction would have been 42.7% (instead 
of 47.3%) relative to the 2019 base year."
"A further metric for assessing our targets with regard to 
listed equities, corporate bonds and direct real estate is the 
relative CO2e footprint (t CO2e/€m invested)."
"The financed 
GHG emissions from this portfolio are shown in proportion 
to the market value of our investments."
"The amount was  
75 (t CO2e/€m invested) on 31 December 2022; as at 
31 December 2023, it was 68 (t CO2e/€m invested)."
"The 
metricʼs denominator takes into account all market values of 
the investments that fall under the scope of the Munich Re 
Group Ambition 2025."
"This also includes market values of 
investments for which no CO2e data is available to us."
"Data 
availability therefore also influences this metric in addition 
to the actual progression of the portfolio’s CO2e footprint."
"In 
the reporting year, CO2e data was available to us for 93.6% 
(93.0%) of the investments in the scope of the denominator."

"We have reviewed our disclosures on this basis and 
changed them accordingly, provided that the interpretation 
was clear and, in light of the late publication of the notice, 
that implementation was feasible."
"Information that is not 
clear or contradicts previous FAQs, however, must first  
be checked by us."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation sets out  
a standardised system for classifying which economic 
activities can be qualified as environmentally sustainable, 
and under which conditions."
"The taxonomy criteria 
applicable to date for the climate-related environmental 
objectives climate change mitigation (CCM) and climate 
change adaptation (CCA) have been updated with changes 
to the technical screening criteria, and additional economic 
activities have been added."
"For any economic activity 
disclosed for the first time or modified in 2023, a two-year 
transition period applies during which it is only necessary to 
report on the taxonomy-eligibility of that activity."
"For the 2023 reporting year, we are reporting for the first 
time not only on the share of our taxonomy-eligible assets, 
but also on the share of our assets with which we finance 
economic activities that are taxonomy-aligned with the 
climate-related environmental objectives."
"Our focus with 
regard to the taxonomy is to calculate the metrics required 
by regulation."
"There are no broader strategic implications  
at present."
"At the time of publication, no information on the four non-
climate-related environmental objectives for the reporting 
year was available from our investee companies."
"However, 
we examined our direct real estate used by third parties, 
and other investments in non-financial assets, for the first 
time to determine their taxonomy-eligibility and thus their 
contribution to the newly applicable environmental 
objectives."
"In this process, we also took into account the 
new economic activities with respect to the climate-related 
environmental objectives."
"All assets that are theoretically able to finance economic 
activities fall within the scope of the taxonomy KPIs."
"This predominantly includes the balance sheet items 
“Investments”, “Investments for unit-linked life insurance” 
and “Insurance-related financial instruments”."
"It does not 
include intangible assets, owner-occupied property or 
further property, plant and equipment that are not held for 
the purpose of financing economic activities."
"Insurance and 
reinsurance contracts that are classified as assets for 
accounting purposes, and cash resources such as cash  
at banks, cheques and cash in hand are also excluded."
"Furthermore, Investments in governments, central banks 
and supranational issuers fall outside the scope of the 
taxonomy KPIs."
"Investments in governments also include 
investments in German federal states (Bundesländer), 
regions, municipalities, cities and communities."
"Issuers  
with EU state guarantees are subject to an assessment to 
determine their taxonomy-eligibility and -alignment."
"The total investments – the basis for calculating the 
coverage ratio – predominantly include the balance sheet 
items “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Other assets”, in 
addition to the investments in the scope of the taxonomy 
KPIs."
"The following table shows the scope of the taxonomy KPIs 
based on the IFRS carrying amounts, and the coverage 
ratio, i.e."
"the assets covered by the KPIs relative to the total 
investments considered."
"It presents a full breakdown of the 
investments that fall within the scope of the taxonomy KPIs."
"In order to fulfil the requirement in Article 6 of the 
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, we also 
disclose the templates set out in Annex X of that regulation 
under “EU Taxonomy Regulation templates”."
"In this section of the report, many of the disclosure 
requirements for the current reporting year are being 
presented for the first time."
"For that reason, comparative 
information will only be available as of the 2024 reporting 
year."

Scope of application of the taxonomy KPIs as per Art."
"Taxonomy-
eligible activities are activities that are deemed to be 
generally suitable for making a positive contribution to the 
respective environmental objective."
"In accordance with Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, 
economic activities are taxonomy-aligned if they actually 
contribute substantially to one or more of the environmental 
objectives, without causing significant harm to one of the 
others (principle of “do no significant harm” or DNSH)."
"Both 
are determined by using technical screening criteria."
"To 
qualify as taxonomy-aligned, the company carrying out the 
economic activity must also ensure it does so in compliance 
with minimum safeguards."
"Regarding our investments in other 
financial undertakings, however, no published information 
about their taxonomy-alignment was available to us at  
the time of publication."
"For that reason, we disclose these 
under “Assets funding taxonomy-eligible economic activities 
where alignment has not yet been assessed”."
"In cases where the taxonomy-alignment data is inconsistent 
or incomplete, we disclose the investments under “Assets 
funding taxonomy-eligible but not taxonomy-aligned 
economic activities”."
"We base this  
on information from a data provider and only use actual 
reported data."
"The denominator accordingly constitutes  
the total assets covered by the taxonomy KPIs."
"We have undertaken our own classification to determine 
the taxonomy-eligibility and -alignment of our real estate 
used by third parties, mortgage loans and other 
investments in non-financial assets."
"The same applies to 
our infrastructure investments held via holdings or special-
purpose vehicles (SPVs) and for which we performed a 
look-through."
"We also looked through our unconsolidated funds to  
the assets contained therein, to determine the taxonomy-
eligibility and -alignment of the former."
"With regard to our investments in renewable energy and 
forestry, the most relevant economic activities are 4.1."
"Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology, 
4.3."
Electricity generation from wind power and 1.3.
"For this reporting year, we were able to 
report only a small share of our investments in renewable 
energy, and none of our investments in forestry, as 
taxonomy-aligned."
"This is because fulfilment of the DNSH 
criteria for the two climate-related environmental objectives 
cannot yet be fully documented."
"We are reliant on the 
operating companies to support us with the remaining 
documentation requirements."
"Through continuous dialogue 
and further engagement, we are working towards obtaining 
the missing documentation from the companies in question."
"We expect an increase in the alignment ratio for the above-
mentioned asset classes for the coming reporting year."
"Mortgage loans to private individuals and companies as 
well as direct and indirect real estate used by third parties 
have made the greatest contribution to our taxonomy-
alignment."
"These economic activities primarily fall under 
the category 7.7."
"Acquisition and ownership of buildings 
and have been allocated exclusively to the environmental 
objective climate change mitigation."
"We were not able to 
report any taxonomy-alignment for the activities classified 
under 7.1."
Construction of new buildings or 7.2.
"Renovation 
of existing buildings in the reporting year."
"This is due to the 
fact that adequate evidence that the DNSH criteria have 
been met cannot yet be provided in full."
"In the case of loans, 
the buildings that serve as collateral for the mortgage loans 
were used as the basis for assessing taxonomy-eligibility 
and -alignment."
"As part of this taxonomy assessment, we checked the 
energy status of the buildings."
"Their energy efficiency was 
determined on the basis of energy performance certificates 
or energy-efficiency data obtained by external service 
providers."
"Due to a lack of availability of energy performance 
certificates for the majority of residential buildings in 
Germany serving as collateral for mortgage loans, an energy-
efficiency-class screening was carried out by Sprengnetter 
Property Valuation Finance GmbH based on comparable 
buildings."
"Due to a lack of public data, 
determination of the top 15% was based on relevant 
studies."
"For residential buildings in Germany, a study by 
the Association of German Pfandbrief Banks and Drees & 
Sommer, updated in August 2023, was used."
"For commercial 
buildings in Germany and abroad, the basis was data from 
the Institut de l’Epargne Immobilière et Foncière (IEIF) in 
collaboration with software provider Deepki, supported by 
the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB) and the 
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)."
"In assessing the DNSH criterion for climate change 
adaptation, an analysis of current and future, material, 
physical climate risks that could affect buildings was 
performed using Munich Re Service GmbH’s climate- 
risk analysis tool (“Risk Suite”)."
"We mainly use data from the provider ISS ESG 
to identify such companies."
"In addition, we perform a 
consistency check based on relevant data from Bloomberg."
"Our investments in asset-backed securities (ABS) are 
reported under “Assets not in scope of the numerator”."
"Based on the regional distribution of our ABS portfolio  
as well as random samples of originators known to us,  
we came to the conclusion that the majority consisted of 
companies that are not subject to the reporting obligations."
"Because insufficient data was available, we were also unable 
to look through to the ultimate beneficiaries for a large 
portion of our investments in ABS."
"Our investments in private equity funds are reported in the 
same way as funds not managed by MEAG where it was 
not possible to perform a look-through despite sufficient 
efforts, i.e."
"under “Assets funding taxonomy-non-eligible 
economic activities”."
"In accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation, in combination with Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (Commission Delegated 
Regulation 2021/2178), in the following we report metrics 
concerning the share of our taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-
aligned assets."
"The table provides a full breakdown of the 
assets included in the assessment of taxonomy-eligibility 
and -alignment."
"In order to fulfil the requirement in 
Article 6 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2021/2178, we also disclose the templates set out in  
Annex X of that regulation under “EU Taxonomy Regulation 
templates”."
"With regard to environmental objectives 
3–6, eligibility was assessed only for direct investments in non-financial assets."
"For our liquid investments in other undertakings, no reported data on environmental 
objectives 3–6 was available at the time of publication."
"Moreover, alignment figures are included only from non-financial investee undertakings, as reported alignment data 
from financial undertakings is not yet available."

"Financial undertakings are obliged as a matter of principle to 
base their taxonomy-alignment calculations on adjusted key 
performance indicators from the non-financial undertakings 
in which they invest."
"Non-financial undertakings are obliged 
to adjust their share of taxonomy-aligned economic activities 
if they have financed taxonomy-aligned turnover and/or 
capital expenditure using proceeds from green bonds they 
have issued."
"Due to incomplete disclosures from our 
investee companies, we were not able to make such an 
adjustment for the reporting year."
"For the 2022 reporting year, our investee companies have 
taken into account the Complementary Climate Delegated 
Act with regard to the climate change mitigation and 
climate change adaptation environmental objectives."
"Accordingly, information on the taxonomy-eligible and 
taxonomy-aligned nuclear energy and fossil gas related 
activities of those companies subject to disclosure 
obligations was made available to us for the first time  
for the 2023 reporting year."
"In the following, we provide an overview of our investment 
activities in fossil gas and nuclear energy generation as 
well as the share of our assets that fund the associated 
taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic 
activities (4.26–4.31)."
"In addition, under “EU Taxonomy

"In the case of alternative investments, we have 
initiated a dialogue with the operators of the assets to 
address the criteria in the taxonomy screening process  
that have not been met."
"Moreover, the range of economic 
activities defined as taxonomy-eligible and the scope of 
companies required to publish taxonomy-alignment data 
will both be expanded in the future."
"Insurance activities 
Strategy and objectives 
The main pillar of our corporate responsibility is the taking 
and diversification of risks in primary insurance and in 
reinsurance."
"Our objective – to create sustainable economic 
value – is enshrined in the key principles of our Group-wide 
corporate strategy, in our Munich Re Group Ambition 2025 
and in our sustainability strategy."
"Our dedication to conducting our business responsibly is 
underlined by our commitment to key industry initiatives 
such as the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), and 
by signing the UN Global Compact."
"Strategic sustainability targets are decided at Group level 
in the ESG Committee."
"Implementation of these targets 
and monitoring of the Group-wide ESG strategy lie within 
the responsibility of the ESG Management Team."
"In our 
relevant fields of business we have specific committees  
or bodies in place to address the possible risks and 
opportunities our operations may have for society and 
environment."
This is also reflected in our Code of Conduct.
"In insurance business, we also take reputational risks into 
account, in addition to climate- and non-climate-related 
ESG aspects."
"We then also apply the implications of our findings when 
developing new products."
"In addition to defining exclusion 
criteria and duties of care in mandatory guidelines, we aim 
to help mitigate climate change by insuring new, climate-
friendly technologies."
"Our insurance solutions also aim to 
make those technologies more attractive and financially 
viable for investors."
"In addition, the insurance products  
we offer increase our clients’ resilience to the economic 
consequences of natural catastrophes."
"To help meet the Paris climate targets, we have committed 
to decarbonisation goals in our Group Ambition 2025."
"We 
have been pursuing these goals since 2020 and have 
adjusted our business accordingly."
"We are maintaining our 
commitment to net zero by 2050, also after discontinuing 
our membership in the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) 
on 31 March 2023."
"This also encompasses 
treaty-like business in the form of facultative facilities if it 
includes the option to decline individual risks."
"Moreover, we have committed to completely phase out the 
(re)insurance of thermal coal activities altogether in our 
primary insurance and facultative and direct (re)insurance 
business by 2040."
"We aim to reduce the GHG emissions 
from insured activities related to our insureds’ thermal coal 
production (mines) and coal-fired power plants by 35% by 
2025, relative to the base year of 2019."
"We explain the metrics used to estimate the development 
of the GHG emissions as part of our metric reporting."
"In addition, Munich Re has also committed to phase out 
insuring thermal coal in its reinsurance treaty business by 
2040."
"With respect to quantitative decarbonisation targets, we 
have also set ourselves targets – in both our primary 
insurance and facultative and direct (re)insurance business 
– for our operational property business covering oil and gas 
production."
"In addition to our long-term objective of net 
zero by 2050, we have committed to short-term emission 
reductions, to lower our self-calculated GHG emissions 
associated with our business by 5% by 2025 relative to the 
base year of 2019."
"We want to make a positive contribution to our strategic 
decarbonisation targets by also applying underwriting 
restrictions on fossil fuels."
"Measures 
We have implemented guidelines, processes and tools to 
take ESG aspects into account in our insurance business."
"They include ESG criteria applicable across the Group, 
which we apply throughout our insurance activities."
"Specific binding ESG guidelines, with a focus on climate- 
and non-climate related ESG risks, govern the handling of 
certain business activities."
"Our stance on other sensitive topics, such as mining 
and fracking, is determined by Group-wide position papers."
"A special ESG tool helps our underwriters in the facultative 
and direct (re)insurance business to factor ESG criteria into 
their risk assessment."
"This is especially relevant in the 
industrial sector, which is subject to particular exposure 
and duties of care."
"In addition, for ESG risk assessment  
we also make use of the expertise contained in renowned 
external ESG databases."
"Our processes provide that individual transactions which are 
potentially critical from an ESG-related or other perspective 
be submitted to Reputational Risk Committees, which are 
in place for every field of business (at ERGO, handled by the 
Reputation and Integrity Committee)."
"These committees 
review whether a planned transaction is appropriate."
"Their 
role is to ensure that we do not make any decisions that 
harbour material reputational risks (see “Risk management” 
for details)."
"We also hold information sessions and training 
courses as part of our responsible approach to handling 
ESG aspects."
"In the 2023 financial year, we again conducted 
seminars and client events to provide business partners 
and staff with information about current climate and 
sustainability topics."
"In addition, dedicated sustainability 
teams in the primary insurance and reinsurance fields  
of business support the operating divisions by providing 
tailored ESG advice."
"Specific underwriting guidelines restrict writing business in 
fossil fuels."
"Multi-location 
covers are treated like single-location risks if the majority  
of the locations or insured risks qualify as “new”."
"We also 
ceased insuring related single risks in primary insurance  
in 2018."
"A complete ban on underwriting new coal-related 
risks has applied at ERGO since 2021."
"For oil and natural gas production, we have put exclusions 
in place for the insurance of oil-sand extraction and the 
related infrastructure."
"In primary insurance and facultative 
and direct (re)insurance business, it has been prohibited 
since 2019 to cover new or existing oil-sand sites, or new or 
existing oil-sand-related infrastructure."
"Our guidelines apply 
to single locations and stand-alone risks."
"The exclusion also 
applies to mixed policies with exposure above a set 
threshold of 20% of the sum insured or revenue."
"In December 2021, we reinforced our guidelines on Arctic 
oil and gas drilling, including directly related infrastructure, 
for all Group entities that underwrite business of this kind."
"We no longer accept any corresponding single-risk stand-
alone covers."
"This also applies to mixed covers and treaty 
reinsurance business, where the exposure is above a defined 
single-digit percentage threshold."
"The new guidelines apply 
to renewals of existing reinsurance treaty business with 
commencement dates of 2023 or later."
"This applies to our primary insurance business 
and our facultative and direct (re)insurance business, 
effective 1 April 2023."
"Our rules prohibit the above-mentioned 
measures and activities, unless the oil and gas fields were 
already producing, or construction on or operation of the 
corresponding power plants or infrastructure had already 
begun, as at 31 December 2022."
"The same applies where 
such risks or projects are contained or bundled in one cover 
together with other risks (e.g."
"existing oil or gas fields), 
where the cover is mainly designed to insure one or more of 
such new risks."
"In autumn of 2023, in addition to strengthening our 
underwriting guidelines to improve human rights protection 
(see “Human rights” for details), we also integrated a 
stricter due diligence process for protecting biodiversity."
"Any exceptions to the mandatory guidelines mentioned 
above must be approved by the respective Board Committee."
"In the context of our decarbonisation targets, we remain 
committed to reaching the defined milestones by 
implementing dedicated action plans in the business units 
concerned, and by regularly monitoring progress."
"Reductions in GHG emissions can be achieved through 
activities undertaken by our clients first-hand, as well as 
through our own portfolio management measures 
(including discontinuation of business)."
"To support the 
necessary transition as best we can, we initiate dialogue 
with our clients."
"To make a positive contribution to decarbonisation and 
support investment in low-emission technologies, we offer 
dedicated green tech solutions."
"In the context of these 
insurance solutions, we assume a share of the technology-
specific risks in order to support the development of 
renewables and low-carbon technology."
"Our focus in that 
regard is on photovoltaics, wind power, battery storage 
systems and hydrogen technologies."
"We also offer 
innovative risk-transfer solutions for e-mobility, circular 
economy, carbon capture and storage, as well as for the 
exploration risks of geothermic drilling."
"A concrete example of low-emission technology is green 
hydrogen, which can replace fossil fuels in the energy, 
industrial, transport and heating sectors."
"Our Green Tech 
Solutions unit has developed a guarantee cover for 
hydrogen production facilities accordingly."
"With innovative 
risk-transfer solutions of this kind, we shift the boundaries 
of insurability."
"For example, by offering long-term 
performance covers for green technologies, we reduce both 
the business risk for manufacturers and the risk for energy-
project investors and operators."
"This 
facility covers political risks, reducing the insurance gap  
for renewable energy projects."
"The AEGF encourages 
private investment, offering tailored insurance solutions for 
renewable energy projects."
"Our products and services in primary insurance are also 
promoting the energy transition, supporting customers who 
act sustainably, and developing solutions for new risks."
"The 
latter include the challenges of climate change, and losses 
caused by natural catastrophes."
"By offering special covers, 
for example against the failure to meet projected annual 
energy output targets, ERGO promotes solar power 
generation among its commercial customers."
"To satisfy the 
requirements specific to e-mobility, ERGO offers insurance 
add-ons for electric and hybrid vehicles, to cover, for example, 
battery damage and peripherals such as the client’s 
battery-charging station."
"In addition, ERGO’s homeowners’ 
insurance in Germany supports environmentally friendly 
rebuilding, and offers insurance cover for renewable energy 
facilities (photovoltaics, heat pumps, wallboxes or charging 
stations)."
"ERGO’s homeowners’ insurance also rewards 
loss prevention and modernisation."

In addition, by providing insurance against natural 
catastrophes, we increase the resilience of vulnerable 
groups."
"An example is the expertise and reinsurance 
capacity Munich Re provides to support the Southeast  
Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (SEADRIF)."
"SEADRIF 
is an insurance institution headquartered in Singapore and 
supported by the World Bank and the Monetary Authority 
of Singapore (MAS)."
"SEADRIF helps protect Laos against 
catastrophic flood events."
"If a catastrophic event occurs, 
funds from the insurance facility are used to finance 
disaster relief operations for the affected populations."
"The 
objective set by those countries and donors supporting 
SEADRIF is to successively expand the insurance 
programme to other countries in Southeast Asia."
"Metrics 
At Munich Re we attach great importance to transparency 
for our stakeholders."
"In the following, we therefore provide 
information about how our most important sustainability-
related metrics are progressing in our (re)insurance business."
We assess risks as part of our Group-wide risk management.
"A key figure in this respect is the loss to our insurance 
portfolio from climate-related natural catastrophes for a 
200-year return period, which we calculate on the basis of 
natural catastrophe modelling in our internal risk model."
"In the following table, we illustrate the value at risk of the 
economic profit and loss distribution over a one-year time 
horizon with a confidence level of 99.5%."
"Value at risk 
€m 
 
2023  
Prev."
"The actual loss from natural catastrophes in the 2023 full 
year mostly came from property business and amounted to 
€2,335m (€2,118m)1 for the reinsurance business after 
external retrocession."
"This corresponds to 9.0% (8.7%)1 of 
net insurance revenue."
"and takes into account major losses 
exceeding €30m."
"In accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, we 
comprehensively report on the economic activities deemed 
environmentally sustainable for (re)insurers."
"The European 
classification system stipulates that non-life (re)insurance 
activities can make a substantial contribution to the 
environmental objective of climate change adaptation."
"Our focus with regard to the taxonomy is to calculate the 
metrics required by regulation."
"There are no broader 
strategic implications at present."
"We are reporting on our taxonomy-aligned (re)insurance 
activities under the EU Taxonomy Regulation for the first 
time for the 2023 financial year."
"Taxonomy-aligned (re)insurance 
activities in this regard are based particularly on modelling 
techniques and product-design processes that comply with 
the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"In 
addition, for taxonomy-aligned activities no significant 
harm to the environmental objective of climate change 
mitigation as defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation was 
identified."
"Taxonomy-aligned (re)insurance 
activities do not include the (re)insurance of fossil-fuelled 
power plants, among others."
"In addition, when conducting 
the taxonomy-aligned (re)insurance activities, the minimum 
safeguards set out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation are 
maintained."
"These include compliance with minimum 
safeguards regarding human rights, anti-corruption, 
taxation and unfair competition (see also “Human rights” 
and “Compliance”)."
"The taxonomy-alignment metrics show the absolute IFRS 
insurance revenue that has been deemed taxonomy-
aligned, and its share of total non-life (re)insurance revenue 
(“alignment ratio”)."
"In this regard, only the share of 
insurance revenue that covers climate-related events is 
considered to be taxonomy-aligned (“climate-related 
share”)."
"Determining taxonomy-alignment is based first on 
the data underlying the pricing, which forms the basis for 
deriving the taxonomy-aligned IFRS insurance revenue."
"The disclosure overall, as well as the extents to which 
taxonomy-aligned insurance activities have been ceded  
to a reinsurer or are deemed reinsurance activities, are 
consistent with IFRS segment reporting."
"The assessment of insurance revenue according to the  
“do no significant harm” (DNSH) criteria is based on 
information made available to us from our clients."
"Where 
the data is not sufficiently granular, we mainly use sector 
classifications for approximation."
"Insurance activities that 
do significant harm to climate change mitigation are, on 
this basis, classified as non-taxonomy-aligned as a whole, 
and pro-rata non-taxonomy-aligned for the reinsurance 
business."
"Our taxonomy-aligned (re)insurance activities 
listed below make a substantial contribution, as enabling 
activities, to climate change adaptation."
"A contribution to 
taxonomy-aligned business activity has been identified for 
all lines of business classified as taxonomy-eligible, i.e."
"other motor insurance, marine, aviation and transport 
insurance, and fire and other damage to property insurance."
"Due to its only minor contribution to the environmental 
objective of climate change adaptation, workers’ 
compensation insurance has not been classified as 
taxonomy-eligible as of 2023."
"The taxonomy-aligned share of taxonomy-eligible non-life 
insurance and reinsurance business constitutes 14.1%."
"This 
is due to the fact that, contrary to the case for assessing 
taxonomy-alignment and consistently with last year, 
calculating taxonomy-eligibility uses the sum of IFRS 
insurance revenue associated with covering climate-related 
perils."
"It encompasses the total insurance revenue of those 
regulatory lines of insurance business (LoBs) that are listed 
in the EU Delegated Taxonomy Regulation 2021/2139 and 
which contain products that cover climate-related perils."
"If one were to use only the climate-related share of  
the insurance revenue of the products when calculating 
taxonomy-eligibility, similarly to the approach for 
calculating taxonomy-alignment, the share of taxonomy-
eligible (re)insurance activities would be 9.3%."
"This is 
based on those re(insurance) activities for which specific 
data on the climate-related share of the insurance revenue 
is available."
"Accordingly, the remaining IFRS insurance revenue from 
non-life insurance business is classified as non-taxonomy-
eligible."
"The remainder is either attributable to an unlisted 
regulatory line of non-life primary or reinsurance business, 
or comes from an LoB which does not contain any product 
that explicitly prices climate risks or covers climate risks in 
the insurance terms and conditions."
"Overall, insurance revenue from our (re)insurance activities 
can be broken down as follows with regard to its 
environmental sustainability under the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation and its corresponding share of total non-life 
insurance business."
"Our reporting in accordance with the 
regulatory template in the EU Taxonomy Delegated 
Regulation 2023/2486 can be found under “EU Taxonomy 
Regulation templates”."

"The metrics exclusively reflect contributions to the 
environmental objective of climate change adaptation,  
as per the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"As insurers, we 
contribute both to the adaptation to climate change risks 
and to the mitigation of climate risks."
"The EU rules do not 
classify insurance activities that mitigate climate change, 
such as insurance products for renewables, as taxonomy-
eligible, and such activities are therefore not included in  
the above figure."
"As a result, our efforts in the renewable 
energy sector are not reflected in the illustrated share of 
our taxonomy-eligible (re)insurance activities."
"As at 
31 December 2023, our Green Tech Solutions unit alone 
insured renewable energy in around 1,400 (900) projects, 
and manufacturers from around 90 (80) countries, for a 
total nominal output of over 75 (over 55) gigawatts."
"Our 
products consist of newly developed insurance solutions 
that particularly address performance, longevity and 
financing risks."
"We measure the achievement of our climate targets in 
primary insurance and facultative and direct (re)insurance 
in the Munich Re Group Ambition 2025, which does not 
include treaty reinsurance business, based on the following 
metrics."
"The base year is 2019; 
for all active risks as at 31 December 2019."

The development of the installed operational capacity (in megawatts) of the 
insured coal-fired power plants of our insureds is used as an equivalent for an 
approximate development of GHG emissions."
"These are based on the latest

"As in the previous year, the reductions are mainly due to 
active portfolio management measures, including 
discontinuation of business."
"External changes on our clients’ 
side, including possible transformational effects, have so far 
had a lesser impact on the overall development."
"In the area of (conventional and unconventional) oil and  
gas production, the quantitative emissions-reduction target 
refers directly to our self-calculated GHG emissions of  
the insured oil and gas production of our clients that are 
associated with our property insurance business."
"We 
calculate the figure by first determining our clients’ 
scope 1–31 life-cycle GHG emissions associated with the 
produced amounts of oil and gas."
"For these calculations, we 
use the expertise of our subsidiary HSB Solomon Associates 
LLC, who themselves use the integrated open-source tool

The strong reduction is mainly due to portfolio measures.
"Besides the application of underwriting restrictions, 
especially regarding sanctions, oil-sand sites or Arctic 
exposures, the discontinuation of business driven by 
strategic decisions of the Munich Re Syndicate significantly 
contributed to the development."
"Customer orientation and satisfaction 
Strategy and objectives 
Maintaining a close relationship of trust with our clients is  
a key element towards the success of our business."
"That is 
why we want to understand our clients’ needs and develop 
the best possible solutions for them, in a joint dialogue."
"We apply a differentiated management approach under  
our business model, which applies both to our reinsurance 
clients and to our primary insurance customers and  
reflects their different demands and needs accordingly."
"Responsibilities lie with the respective Board members 
and/or executives, as well as within the various 
international companies."
"Just how important our clients are 
to us is demonstrated by the fact that client satisfaction is 
an integral part of the Munich Re Group Ambition 2025."
"At Munich Re, we manage the dialogue with our clients, 
and the solutions we correspondingly offer, on the basis of 
our clients’ needs and growth ambitions."
"The process 
includes an analysis of the market and the most important 
players, as well as the implementation of tailored insurance 
solutions, products and services for our clients."
"Client 
managers in reinsurance are supported by a central sales 
unit that ensures transparency in our Group-wide product 
and service palette."
"In  
addition, we offer our reinsurance clients an extensive 
seminar programme on insurance-related topics, based on 
our leading expertise."
"ERGO particularly supports its 
independent sales partners with various offers, for example 
advisory tools and concepts, and professional development 
training."
"The local companies individually tailor these offers 
to their respective needs."
"Measures 
At Munich Re, we have defined numerous monitoring 
processes to measure our performance in terms of 
customer satisfaction and orientation."
"Customer satisfaction is measured in both primary 
insurance and reinsurance."
"Every two years, we undertake a global customer-
satisfaction survey among all of our reinsurance clients."
"The survey measures the NPS and customer satisfaction  
in various aspects of the business relationship."
"We publish 
the NPS and selected results of the survey on our website."
"Our goal is to maintain a stable, positive NPS in reinsurance."
"Our last global satisfaction survey of reinsurance clients 
was conducted in May 2022."
"Customer satisfaction in primary insurance is measured 
continuously throughout the year."
"Since Q4 2023, we have 
also measured overall customer satisfaction in addition to 
using the NPS."
"This customer satisfaction is a new key 
performance indicator for ERGO and allows for more 
focused management and greater transparency in the 
development of measures."
"The result shows the percentage 
of satisfied customers across important core markets, 
currently in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, India, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Austria, Poland and Spain."
"ERGO’s objective is 
to achieve a high percentage of satisfied customers."
"The results of our monitoring identify any potential for both 
improvement and differentiation in the specific divisions, 
platforms, services, products and customer groups."
"In the 
form of initiatives, this information then becomes part of 
our strategy to meet our Munich Re Group Ambition 2025, 
i.e."
to remain a long-term partner for our clients.
"In addition to our regular client satisfaction surveys, in 
reinsurance we have implemented a number of measures 
aimed at consolidating our client relationships."
"And our 
operational units regularly request feedback from their 
clients to complement the centrally organised survey."
"In order to better respond to our clients’ suggestions for 
improvement, we offer a comprehensive training programme 
to all staff who have direct contact with clients."
"The aim is for 
them to develop an understanding of our clients’ strategies 
and needs so that we can develop solutions together."

Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
In primary insurance, our advice to our independent sales 
partners’ customers in Germany is provided using a 
standardised approach (ERGO Kompass) to ensure that 
quality is consistently high."
"ERGO also uses a variety of 
tools to obtain direct feedback about new products and 
services, but also about overarching strategic issues."
"The 
main focus is its in-house market research panel (ERGO 
Kundenwerkstatt) of around 7,500 customers."
"In 2023 
alone, ERGO conducted 30 projects and/or surveys among 
the panel members."
"This feedback from our customers is 
very important to us."
"Among other things, we use it in 
product development and to improve our services for them."
"Besides customer feedback, we also record and assess 
customer complaints."
"This input is used as a basis for 
improvements in the various areas."
"ERGO’s goal is to become one of the leading digital insurers 
by 2025 – both in Germany and in its core international 
markets."
"This reflects our customers’ desire to purchase 
insurance and receive customer service digitally."
"ERGO is 
driving topics such as robotics, artificial intelligence and 
voice technology in Germany and internationally, and is 
expanding its digital business models and ecosystems, as 
well as its annex business."
"It has already established numerous customer-oriented 
services and digital processes that help customers contact 
ERGO, and more are planned."
"ERGO is also constantly 
working on modernising its offerings with simple and 
intuitive products for both its private and commercial 
customers."
"Metrics 
Our most recent NPS of 60 for reinsurance in 2022 is very 
high – higher again than the 2020 figure of 56."
"The NPS is 
measured on a scale of −100 to +100."
"High levels of 
customer satisfaction are evident in primary insurance, too."
"Some 94% of customers gave ERGO or its local companies 
in the core markets a rating of “good” or higher in 2023."
"Satisfaction can be rated overall on a range from “poor” to 
“adequate”, “good”, “very good” or “excellent”."
"This 
also includes the monitoring of our Group-wide activities  
to mitigate the impacts of our own GHG emissions on the 
environment and the climate, and our corresponding 
reduction and decarbonisation targets."
"Our goal is to make 
a positive contribution toward meeting the requirements 
set out in the Paris Agreement."
"Our targets and actions to lower our GHG emissions  
focus on reducing our consumption of energy and other 
resources such as water and paper, avoiding waste, and 
making our business travel more environmentally friendly."
"To this end, we promote awareness of green behaviour 
among our staff."
"Under the Munich Re Group Ambition 2025, we have set 
targets regarding our own GHG emissions from business 
operations."
"As a result, we intend to reduce our own GHG 
emissions per staff member by 12% by 2025, as compared 
to the base year 2019."
"This means that we endeavour to 
offset unavoided GHG emissions by purchasing certificates 
for projects that aim to reduce GHG emissions (“GHG-
neutral”) or to remove GHGs from the atmosphere (“GHG 
net zero”)."
"When selecting the certificates, we place value 
on internationally recognised certification standards such 
as the Gold Standard."
"For 2023, all of the Group’s 
recognised GHG emissions from business activities were 
made GHG-neutral, and those at Group headquarters in 
Munich were brought to GHG net zero."
"Implementing the strategy and target-
achievement measures takes place at Group level, in the 
respective divisional units, and locally."
"Measures 
We focus on measures that, in our opinion, provide good 
leverage in reducing our GHG emissions."
"Our key metric  
is the change in GHG emissions in terms of our GHG 
footprint per employee."
"Improving energy efficiency in the 
operation of our buildings and replacing fossil fuels with 
renewable energy are important action items for us."
"In 
2023, 91% of our purchased electricity for all companies 
and sites included in qualitative reporting (86% of staff) 
was generated from renewable sources."
"Our goal is to 
purchase 100% green electricity for those companies and 
sites by 2025."
"This target for green electricity was made 
more specific in the reporting year to account for market 
practice."
"Electricity consumption by those companies not 
included in reporting was extrapolated, and the resulting 
GHG emissions calculated and made GHG-neutral."
"When 
undertaking business travel, we also exercise the option of 
using more environmentally friendly rail travel, or hybrid 
and electric vehicles."
"We are working locally to save resources such as water and 
paper at our various locations, as well as to reduce waste."
"We aim to promote sustainable consumer materials for 
example by using reusable containers in our food and drink 
service for staff."
"In order to support climate action, Munich Re is involved in 
national initiatives such as the Development and Climate 
Alliance in Germany, among other projects."
"In 2023, 52% 
(49%) of Munich Re staff were involved in a DIN ISO 14001- 
or Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)-certified 
environmental management system that systematically 
monitors and assesses the implementation of applicable 
environmental criteria in operations and product development."
"Metrics 
We calculate the GHG footprint per employee from our 
business activities by measuring the annual GHG 
emissions resulting from our consumption of energy, paper 
and water, waste, and business travel."
"Any consumption 
data that was not available by the reporting date has  
been estimated."
"Measured consumption figures were 
extrapolated to 100% of Group staff with employment 
contracts at fully consolidated companies as at 
31 December 2023."
"The resulting GHG emissions were 
calculated using internationally recognised methods and 
conversion factors, for example those of the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol and the International Energy Agency, as 
guides."
"In 2023, we collected data for 86% (76%) of staff."
"We have been able to achieve reductions in our own GHG 
emissions per employee of 34% (22%) since 2019."
"Energy 
consumption was down 20% compared to the previous 
year; our energy-saving measures with regard to gas, 
electricity and district heating having mainly contributed 
here."
Our kilometres travelled for business rose by 24%.
"At the same time, the ensuing rise in GHG emissions was 
disproportionally smaller (only 13%), as a result of the 
increase in train travel and the larger share of hybrid and 
electric vehicles in our fleet."
"A detailed breakdown of the relevant metrics are provided 
in the following tables."

Strategy and objectives 
Respect for human rights is a part of our management 
approach to include economic, environmental  
and social challenges in our definition of success."
"The Board of Management has accordingly issued  
a declaration to respect and protect human rights,  
which we have published on the Munich Re website at 
www.munichre.com/sustainability/download."
"This 
statement underscores Munich Re’s commitment to  
human rights, as defined in the UN Guiding Principles  
on Business and Human Rights, in the International  
Bill of Human Rights and in the ILO’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights."
"In accordance with international rules, we have published  
a statement signed by the Board of Management on the 
UK Modern Slavery Act every year since 2017, and since 
2021 we have issued a declaration under the Australian 
Modern Slavery Act as well."
"Munich Re has undertaken to apply its respective due 
diligence and to respect internationally recognised human 
rights."
"This reflects our Group-wide, shared understanding of the 
value of respecting human rights."
"In late 2022, we began work on introducing a Group policy 
that addresses the requirements of the German Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), including the requisite 
processes, measures and responsibilities."
"The policy was 
rolled out in the 2023 reporting year and implemented by 
all units affected by the statutory requirements."
"It creates a 
framework for our suppliers and employees that defines our 
expectations with respect to upholding human rights and 
complying with environmental standards."
"Munich Re’s management is committed to preventing its 
business from having any potentially negative impact on 
human rights."
"In order to systematically monitor any such 
effects, the following four aspects have been defined: staff, 
procurement, our core business of reinsurance and primary 
insurance, and investments."
"We have introduced instruments 
for each of these aspects, which allow us to manage our 
respective decision-making processes in terms of human 
rights."
"This enables us to minimise risks regarding human 
rights violations as far as possible."
"We also strive to improve the guarantees of fundamental 
rights, which also include human rights."
"We do this, among 
other ways, by offering tailor-made insurance products."
"For example, we provide risk solutions to ensure that 
underinsured people in Asia have the basics needed to live."
"Special financial solutions aim to close the coverage gap for 
populations and companies at risk, and to guarantee swift and 
targeted payments."
"Fundamental rights and guarantees are 
also the focus of many of our fundraising and sponsorship 
projects."
"Further information can be found in our Sustainability 
Report, our annual Communication on Progress to the 
UN Global Compact, and our annual reports on the PSI  
and the PRI."
"Measures 
The processes we developed in 2018 to comply with human 
rights due diligence obligations are continuously revised 
and expanded for the Munich Re Group."
"If a human rights violation is reported,  
or we otherwise learn of one, Munich Re’s dedicated 
Compliance units will investigate."
"Every potential case is 
investigated in accordance with a procedure set out in 
internal guidelines."
"Every potential case of misconduct will be 
investigated and resolved."
"If we learn of substantial human 
rights violations in an existing contractual relationship, we 
decide on appropriate and effective remedial action in 
dialogue with the responsible parties."
"Moreover, we endeavour to decline any business 
relationship with, and exclude investments in, companies that 
have been involved in confirmed and substantial violations 
of humans rights."
"For this purpose, a list of companies with 
which we want to exclude business has been developed in  
a multi-stage process based on information from external 
data providers."
"This list is regularly reviewed, updated and 
adopted as part of our ESG governance."
"We began applying 
these policies to our investments, to procurement and to 
single-risk business in primary insurance and facultative 
reinsurance in the course of 2023."
"Staff 
As an employer, we undertake to comply with international 
standards of human rights and to provide adequate working 
conditions for our staff."
"An annual risk analysis and assessment serves to identify 
human rights risks within our workforce."
"We assess 
potential risks and, if necessary, take action to prevent them."
"Our Code of Conduct explicitly states that Munich Re does 
not tolerate any discrimination."
"In Germany, we have set up 
an official department for complaints as provided for in 
Section 13 of the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG)."
"Procurement 
Our goal in procurement, when making decisions and 
taking action, is to adhere to our compliance principles and 
thus assume corporate responsibility along the supply 
chain."
"Avoiding ESG risks is pivotal in our procurement of 
goods and services."
"We had previously required our suppliers 
to accept the principles of the UN Global Compact."
"And 
now we have made our requirements in terms of respecting 
human rights even clearer by adopting a Group-wide Code of 
Conduct for suppliers, which came into effect on 1 January 
2023."
"Accordingly, the vast majority of procurement 
contracts within reinsurance will include a corporate 
responsibility clause."
"This serves, among other things, to 
formalise the Munich Re Group’s human-rights-related 
requirements for suppliers and, if necessary, to have audit 
and special termination rights in the event of a breach."
"A similar clause is currently being implemented for MEAG 
and the ERGO Group."
"The structured and continuous risk 
analysis process that we are currently introducing will allow 
us to even better identify potential human rights violations 
in future, and to mitigate or avoid them accordingly."
"Substantial cases are discussed in dialogue with the 
responsible parties and remedial measures are taken if 
necessary."
"The focus here  
is on client groups for which – given their geography and 
sector – structural factors contribute to an increased risk  
of human rights violations."
"Should in this context significant reputational or human 
rights risks be identified in the underwriting process,  
the underwriting guidelines stipulate an extended review 
process, and risks may need to be presented to the 
respective Reputational Risk Committee prior to acceptance."
"Investments 
As part of a sustainable investment, government bonds 
(including the sub-sovereign level) and notes from 
government-related institutions rated CCC under the  
MSCI ESG Rating scale are excluded due to high risks 
related to socio-economic or political factors."
"Such MSCI 
ESG Ratings also take human rights into account."
"Our 
Responsible Investment Guideline has been updated to 
include human rights standards, among others."
"Exclusions 
also apply to these asset classes if, on the basis of a specific 
country rating for human rights, their risk exposure is 
extreme."
"If the risk exposure is high, the portfolios of assets 
in question are monitored."
"The list of companies we exclude due to their significant 
human rights violations is also used in our investment 
business, where application of the exclusion lists is mandatory 
for our asset managers."
"We have integrated human rights into our due diligence 
process for our alternative investment activities, particularly 
for the asset classes of infrastructure, direct investments in 
forestry and farming, and direct real estate."
"Employee matters 
For Munich Re as a knowledge-based Group, talented and 
high-performing staff with their expertise form the basis  
for our success."
"Attracting, developing and retaining staff  
is one of the two key objectives of our human resources 
policy."
"The second key objective is to promote diversity, 
equity and inclusion (DEI) as a strategic success factor for 
Munich Re."
"Thus, again in 2023, employer attractiveness, 
staff development, and DEI were identified as material 
topics for Munich Re in the area of employee matters."
"As part of the Munich Re Group Ambition 2025, we have 
embedded employee matters in our business strategy."
"In 
this respect, Munich Re is pursuing the goal of significantly 
increasing the proportion of women in management 
positions."
"At the same time, Munich Re is committed to 
positioning itself as an employer of choice offering attractive, 
long-term jobs and excellent development opportunities."
"Moreover, we continue to place great emphasis on the topic 
“Driving Digital Culture”."
"We aim to implement our business strategies in the Group 
as well as possible in the respective client, competitor and 
staff environments that reinsurance, ERGO and MEAG 
face."
"Our operational human resources management is 
closely linked to the specific needs of the respective 
business models and is thus explicitly decentralised."
"In this 
regard, adjustments to central requirements and individual 
solutions regarding employee matters can be made for the 
fields of business where appropriate."
"Employer attractiveness 
Strategy and objectives 
Munich Re’s human resources work is guided by the goal  
of being and remaining an attractive, fair and responsible 
employer."
"Attracting, developing and retaining employees 
with substantial expertise and broad experience worldwide 
are key elements in this regard."
"We encourage a future-
focused and appreciative work culture, in which cooperation 
in our global organisation and external knowledge networks 
leads to the best solutions for our clients."
"Corresponding frameworks are in place in all fields of 
business to set out rules for the various HR topics."
"In 
Germany, these are complemented by internal company 
agreements."
"With a focus on occupational health management, a Health, 
Safety and Wellbeing Statement was developed and 
communicated Group-wide in 2022."
"This statement  
covers four topic areas: mental health, physical health, 
social connectedness and work environment."

A range of “New Work” concepts, developed and tested in 
reinsurance and at ERGO and MEAG in 2022, were adapted 
based on the test results and rolled out in 2023."
"The 
concepts include new workplace designs and frameworks 
for hybrid working."
"In addition to the aforementioned topics, another focus was 
on Munich Re’s positioning in the labour market."
"In this 
context, reinsurance applies the employer value proposition 
“Push boundaries."
"With us.” It presents reinsurance as an 
employer that provides talented staff with the creative 
space they need to achieve more together, while supporting 
and encouraging them in the process."
"Munich Re is always 
on the lookout for staff who will go the extra mile with us, 
who want to continue developing themselves personally and 
professionally, and who are driven to make a contribution to 
the multi-faceted working environment of reinsurance."
"Since 
2022, ERGO has been positioning itself on the external 
labour market with the employer value proposition “ERGO."
"Grow together.” This motto embodies both ERGO’s 
strengths and its ambition: to achieve even more in the 
future and meet the increasing demands in the market with 
confidence."
"At ERGO, we focus on growing as a team while 
offering room for individual development."
"To achieve this, 
we are looking for employees who want to contribute to our 
development and grow together with us."
"We have been 
successively rolling our employer value proposition out to 
the international units since mid-2023."
"In addition to the needs-based recruiting of experts and 
managers, Munich Re is constantly looking for junior staff 
such as students, graduates and young professionals."
"Excellent university graduates are offered the opportunity  
to start a career at Munich Re by joining the Group’s 
“EXPLORE” trainee programme, the International Graduate 
Trainee Programme in reinsurance, MEAG’s “Futures”, or 
ERGO’s “RISE” programme."
"The goal of the programmes is to 
systematically develop participants’ professional, social and 
personal skills to prepare them for the various challenges 
within the Group."
"As at 31 December 2023, there were 10 (10) 
candidates participating in the Group trainee programme, 
65 (63) in reinsurance, 9 (10) at ERGO and 9 (12) at MEAG."
"Metrics 
Munich Re is characterised by high staff retention, a long 
average length of company service, and low rates of voluntary 
turnover and absenteeism."
"The voluntary turnover rate fell 
compared to the previous year."
"We continue to offer our 
staff a broad range of fringe benefits, such as access to 
company healthcare, mobile working options, and flexible 
working hours."
"The percentage of employees with permanent 
contracts increased slightly again this year."
"The decrease in 
the average length of service at Munich Reinsurance Company 
is mainly driven by the large number of new hires in 2023."

"The curriculum is also regularly updated 
to meet current and future demands."
"The development of 
digital skills is significantly changing many aspects of the 
way our employees work worldwide."
"The HR units of the individual fields of business are 
primarily responsible for training measures to improve 
social, methodological, management and language skills."
"Content for training measures and e-learning formats on 
topics such as compliance, data protection and information 
security are in the remit of the respective departments."

In all fields of business, talent programmes systematically 
support employees in their careers, and prepare them for 
future challenges."
"Moreover, a Group function steers the 
strategic management development and succession 
planning for the top management level."
"Continuous talent 
development is key in achieving the strategic goals of the 
Munich Re Group Ambition 2025."
"An objective of the Munich Re Group Ambition 2025 is to 
build and enhance the digital expertise of our employees."
"To 
this end, we are continuously expanding our digital training 
curricula, so that our staff master the tools and methods 
required to drive the digital transformation in our respective 
fields of business."
"Measures 
Munich Re offers a comprehensive range of training 
measures for the development of our employees."
"Providing development opportunities for outstanding 
employees is of major importance for the long-term success 
of our Company."
"We develop the professional and personal 
skills of particularly talented employees through various 
business-field-specific and Group-wide development 
programmes."
"At the Group level, our Group Management 
Platform is primarily aimed at networking our management 
and providing further training on current leadership topics."
"Thereby, we also lay a foundation for succession planning 
at this level."
"In 2023, 100 (137) employees took part in the 
programme."
"In reinsurance, two programmes identify and 
promote talent."
"“Hydrogen” is a three-year programme that 
prepared 74 (88) participants for a more advanced global 
role in 2023."
"“Oxygen” prepares candidates for an initial 
leadership role at the regional level within one to two years, 
with 205 (195) participants in 2023."
"The “ERGO Grow” 
talent-management process is aimed at employees who 
aspire to an initial or more advanced leadership or project-
management role at ERGO."
"149 (166) employees were 
identified and supported as part of that programme in 
2023."
"The “ERGO Leadership Programme” is a talent 
programme for senior managers at ERGO."
"In the first half 
of 2023, 23 highly talented candidates attended two 
modules on the topics of leadership, management and 
strategy at the London Business School."
"Together with  
a change to its remuneration system, MEAG launched  
a new approach to performance management and staff 
development in 2023 called “OneGrowth@MEAG”, which 
aims to help identify and develop (top) talent at MEAG."
"MEAG also offers the “Leading@MEAG” format, a concrete 
programme for managers at the beginning of their 
management careers, with 17 participants in 2023."
"It aims 
to improve networking among participants and introduce 
them to modern management models and tools."
"In addition to these talent programmes, we have various 
centralised training offerings for all employees, with a focus 
on promoting digital competencies."
"In reinsurance, these 
include “LinkedIn Learning”, “get Abstract”, and the “Digital 
School”, a platform with a wide range of learning content 
and formats, which are available globally and enable self-
directed knowledge building."
"LinkedIn Learning, in 
particular, is used extensively around the world because of 
its flexibility and wide range of digital topics."
"This is 
reflected not only by over 8,600 (7,500) activated licences, 
but also by more than 164,000 (172,000) completed 
learning videos."
"The over 6,300 (2,090) visits to the Digital 
School in 2023 underline the relevance and attractiveness 
of the offering."
"ERGO also offers support measures to 
accompany employees in the digital transformation and 
build up their relevant skills."
"With the digital learning 
platform “e-campus”, ERGO provides self-learning 
opportunities in video and audio formats."
"In addition, 
relevant training topics such as resilience, collaboration or 
change management are addressed in-depth in monthly 
themes, and communicated to staff in user-friendly formats 
such as podcasts, short webinars or articles."
"The “digital 
morning”, a monthly hybrid event for all ERGO employees, 
is also firmly established."
"“LinkedIn Learning” has constituted a key new component 
in this regard since Q4 2023, as well as a curriculum that 
caters explicitly to the demands of asset management."
"Metrics 
We measure the success of our efforts through employee 
surveys and the metrics presented below."
"This also provides 
guidance to our management."
"In 2022, we began applying a Group-wide approach for 
measuring sustainable employee engagement, based on 
nine core questions."
"Our Employee Engagement Index 
covers more than 35,000 employees in reinsurance and  
at ERGO and MEAG, and achieved a response rate of  
75% (72%) in 2023."
"In total, 78% (79%) of our Group-wide 
employees who participated in the survey are actively 
engaged."
"The survey results were further analysed by 
gender and age categories."
"In addition to the nine core 
questions to measure long-term employee engagement, 
each business field concentrated on selected business and 
specific people topics within their global employee surveys."
"Combined management report

Our success in developing internal talent is primarily 
reflected in the number of management positions filled 
internally."
"In 2023, the percentage was 74.4% (77.7%) in 
Germany and 60.7% (53.6%) worldwide."
"Moreover, we 
continue to supplement our management with external 
recruits."
"Across all hierarchical levels, 34.1% (34.6%) of 
vacancies worldwide were filled with internal candidates in 
2023."
"When it comes to external recruitment, it is important 
for us to keep bringing new perspectives into the Company."
"Compared to the previous year, we can report a notable 
increase in the number of employees with at least one 
(virtual) training, and in our training costs per employee."
"The decrease in training days per employee reflects the 
clear trend towards shorter training formats."
"At the same 
time, training sessions were increasingly conducted as in-
person events."

"Today, Munich Re 
already employs more than 100 different nationalities at 
over 50 locations worldwide."
"Since 2012, Munich Re has 
been a signatory to the Diversity Charter."
"Employee 
characteristics such as gender, age and internationality  
– as well as other criteria such as religion, disability, culture, 
social origin and sexual orientation ‒ play a special role in 
our activities."
"The strategic management of DEI is carried out by a 
Group-wide function."
"The HR departments of the business 
fields are responsible for the initiatives and the operational 
implementation in the respective locations and business 
units."
"Moreover, Munich Re implemented Group-wide DEI 
governance in 2023."
"All activities are coordinated Group-
wide by the DEI Management Team, consisting of the 
Labour Relations Directors from reinsurance, ERGO and 
MEAG."
"This Management Team is supported by a DEI  
task force, which plays an active role in developing and 
implementing our DEI initiatives at the international level."
"At the global level, we have set ourselves a target of 
achieving 40% female representation at all management 
levels worldwide by 2025."
"We have also set targets specific 
to Germany, in order to meet the statutory requirements."
"Moreover, we also intend to focus globally on the diversity 
dimension of “generations” in future."
"Beyond these global challenges, we also address local 
challenges in the DEI context with specific measures."
"Measures 
Munich Re takes a clear stand against racism, inequality 
and discrimination of any kind."
"Our Group-wide Code of 
Conduct, which is binding for all employees, prohibits 
discrimination, social misconduct and harassment."
"In 
Germany, employees receive regular mandatory training  
on the German Equal Treatment Act (AGG) and the Code  
of Conduct, to promote understanding and compliance."
"Should cases of discrimination arise, there is a clearly 
defined escalation process for reporting such incidents,  
and complaints offices have been established."
"These key figures are 
integrated into the quarterly Group-wide reporting process 
for our business figures."
"To achieve this goal, Munich Re has created a supportive 
environment and implemented numerous measures to 
promote the personal development of all employees."
Established support measures were continued in 2023.
"These include mentoring programmes, coaching, networks 
for different employee groups and individual part-time and 
parental leave models."
"Several family support services in 
the areas of childcare, caring for family members, and 
career counselling complement these offerings."
"In addition, 
new and innovative programmes are regularly developed 
and introduced in the various regions in which our fields of 
business operate."
"Combined management report

Other measures to support gender diversity include 
participation in the “break the bias” campaign, and panel 
discussions on International Women’s Day."
"Moreover, the 
fields of business feature their own women’s networking 
initiatives, such as Women at Munich Re (formerly EFEU) 
and the Women’s Inclusion Network (WIN) in reinsurance, 
as well as win@m at MEAG and women@ergo at ERGO."
"In 
addition to the “Succeed – Women in Leadership” initiative, 
ERGO also offers a mentoring programme for ambitious 
women."
"MEAG sponsors the Fondsfrauen professional 
network."
"Our 15 (10) women’s networks had a total of 2,920 (2,073) 
members in 2023."
"A total of 5,529 (2,567) participants 
attended events during the reporting year."
"Beyond the gender initiatives, many other campaigns took 
place."
"The following activities reflect the strong commitment 
of Munich Re employees to DEI topics in 2023: 
In January the reinsurance business in Munich, together 
with MEAG, organised a day dedicated to staff with 
disabilities."
"In collaboration with the myAbility social 
enterprise, an awareness session was organised, featuring 
educational material, testimonials about people’s 
experiences at work, as well as a segment on the topic  
of “Language creates reality”."
"In December, ERGO 
participated in the International Day of Persons with 
Disabilities, and visibly supported the #PurpleLightUp 
campaign with lighting effects."
"In 2023 the “Global Village” staff network was founded, 
whose mission is to strengthen our inclusive community for 
international employees."
"A total of 17 (16) events were held worldwide in the 4 (4) 
networks of the LGBTQIA+ community."
"Reinsurance and ERGO continued their collaboration with 
Prout at Work."
"During Pride Month in June, MEAG and 
Munich reinsurance’s joint Pride Network established an 
LGBTQIA+ advisory service point."
"This safe space for 
personal advice and support has remained available to all 
staff and managers ever since."
"The network also 
collaborated with Prout at Work in November to host a 
“togathering” on the topic of “Visibility & the Power of 
Authenticity”, to which members of the wider LGBTQIA+ 
community at other companies were invited as well."
"In 
addition, a range of learning programmes are provided 
through LinkedIn Learning and the Catalyst learning 
resource, and they are open to all employees globally."
"These 
offerings were promoted on World Cultural Diversity Day 
and during Pride Month – the awareness month for the 
LGBTQIA+ community – in June."
"For the second year in a 
row, ERGO had its own float in the Christopher Street Day 
parade in Cologne."
"ERGO in Germany organised a Diversity Day in May 2023, 
to keep staff informed of the ongoing DEI measures and 
initiatives at ERGO and to encourage dialogue."
"On the eve 
of Diversity Day, ERGO hosted the festivities to celebrate 
the 10th anniversary of the Rhine-Ruhr Diversity Network."
"In addition, October was Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
Month at ERGO, offering employees 13 different formats  
to participate in."
"Moreover, Munich Re continues to 
emphasise balance and diversity in our various talent 
programmes, particularly with regard to gender."
"Finally,  
we also take additional dimensions into account, such as 
nationality and age."
"Metrics 
The share of women in management positions worldwide 
reached 39.5% by the end of 2023, having continued to 
grow compared to 2022 and leaving only 0.5 percentage 
points for us to meet our target."
"We achieved the following percentages of women in our 
talent programmes: 44% (41%) in the Group Management 
Platform, 46% (42%) in Hydrogen/reinsurance, 50% (49%) 
in Oxygen/reinsurance, 50% (50%) at ERGO Grow."

"In this 
regard, we will continue to provide Group-wide impulses for 
certain topics, and establish a variety of operational measures 
within the Group to optimally support the respective 
business model and the respective employee structure."
"Governance 
In this section, we report on the topics of compliance as 
well as responsible digital transformation, data protection 
and information security."
"Compliance 
Strategy and objectives 
How Munich Re is perceived by the public and our business 
partners depends on each and every member of our staff."
"Our actions are guided by the principles and values detailed 
in our Code of Conduct, and we strive to maintain our 
stakeholders’ trust and protect Munich Re’s reputation."
Appropriate conduct plays an important role in this regard.
Compliance is the responsibility of every member of staff.
"Based on our Code of Conduct and other commitments to 
responsible conduct (e.g."
"the UN Global Compact), all staff 
have undertaken to act honestly and dependably."
"They are 
to make business decisions in accordance with the law, 
statutes and internal regulations, and avoid any conduct 
that could be detrimental to Munich Re."
"Our Board of 
Management and managers bear a particular responsibility 
for implementing compliance as an integral part of our 
business processes."
"Our managers are role models for our 
staff and have a duty to ensure that business within their 
sphere of responsibility is conducted in accordance with the 
law, statutes and internal regulations."
"We understand compliance, in its broadest sense, to mean 
acting in accordance with the law, statutes and internal 
regulations, such as the Code of Conduct, which apply to 
the operation of an insurance and investment business."
"Compliance is thus a key element of our business processes, 
allowing us to fulfil our responsibilities and to embody 
integrity."
"Providing quality advice to our clients and customers is a 
top priority at Munich Re."
"At ERGO this is reflected, for 
example, in its accession in 2012 to the Code of Conduct 
issued by the German Insurance Association (GDV) for the 
sale of insurance products."
"This Code obliges the signatory 
insurers and their brokers to not only comply with high 
standards of advice and brokerage, but to also have this 
compliance regularly checked by independent auditors."
"In 
2023, for the fifth time, KPMG confirmed that ERGO was 
implementing the provisions of the Code effectively."
"A further objective is to continually improve our Compliance 
Management System, detect and eliminate any violations, 
and regularly report to the appropriate parties."
"In order to meet these objectives, we define, among other 
things, Group-wide standards and monitor compliance 
risks."
"Complying with financial sanctions, constantly keeping up 
with the most recent geopolitical developments, and 
continuous monitoring of such matters were also a key 
focus in 2023."
"The latest regulatory standards are constantly 
monitored and their requirements integrated into Company 
processes."
"Our CMS was 
developed on the basis of the external compliance standards 
ISO 19600 and IDW PS 980 from the German Institute of 
Certified Accountants (IDW) – and carefully tailored to meet 
Munich Re’s needs."
"It is regularly reviewed and continually 
improved."
"The CMS constitutes the methodological 
framework for the structured implementation of the early-
warning, risk-control, advising and monitoring functions."
"Material compliance risks are identified and 
managed using Group-wide methodology; established 
framework concepts and controls are monitored; and 
potential violations that may occur despite these measures 
are investigated."
"Compliance culture 
Our business activities are embedded in a compliance 
culture based on our ethical principles."
"These principles are 
particularly reflected in the Munich Re Code of Conduct, 
our main standard outlining our expectations of all staff to 
act responsibly and to respect the rules and regulations."
"We 
completely revised our Code of Conduct in 2023."
"Compliance organisation involves designing the structure  
of the compliance function, which includes determining the 
tasks, responsibilities and processes with regard to compliance 
measures and interfaces."
"Our compliance unit manages 
compliance activities through Group-wide standards and a 
network of regional and local compliance officers."
"Prevention 
We have set ourselves the goal of enabling our staff to 
conduct themselves ethically and compliantly through a 
defined reference framework, including a Group-wide Code 
of Conduct, guidelines and standards."
"Training, advice for 
managers and staff, and proper communication of relevant 
content also play important roles in this regard."
"The compliance norms specify principles and minimum 
standards for avoiding and managing material compliance 
risks."
"Our Group-wide communication and training courses are 
aimed at increasing awareness of compliance risks and 
dealing with them effectively."
"Both are aimed at and tailored 
to the needs of the various German and international Group 
companies and their respective business models."
"Staff and 
management are required to regularly attend training – either 
in the classroom or via IT-supported programs – on the 
Code of Conduct and selected compliance topics, such as 
preventing corruption, ensuring compliance with antitrust 
law, and data protection."
"Mandatory tests help participants 
grasp and internalise the content, especially in the case of 
online material."
"Combined management report

Detection 
Assessing compliance risks includes the systematic 
identification, analysis and mitigation of such risks."
"The 
process is based on Group-wide methodology to identify, 
assess and document risks."
"Munich Re’s main compliance 
risks and the corresponding mitigation measures are 
analysed and reported to management at least once a  
year."
"The main risk areas include data protection, financial 
sanctions, antitrust law, use of external staff, money 
laundering, sales compliance, corruption, and ESG."
"The 
management of changes to the law is part of our risk 
assessment, allowing us to evaluate in good time any 
possible effects of changes in the legal environment."
"A particular focus in this regard in 2023 was assessing  
and implementing new ESG-related requirements, such  
as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG)."
"Monitoring consists of evaluating whether the implemented 
measures for mitigating material compliance risks are 
appropriate and effective."
"It also includes reviewing the defined 
frameworks and assessing the design and effectiveness of 
the controls implemented."
"If there are any suspicions or allegations of illegal activity 
and/or misconduct within the company, internal 
investigations are conducted by the compliance function."
"We have set up a comprehensive whistleblower system for 
reporting suspicious activity."
"Response 
Continuous improvement means regularly reviewing our 
CMS and compliance measures on the basis of risk 
assessments, monitoring and other relevant information 
from the various departments (audit reports, legal changes, 
organisational changes, etc.), and making adjustments if 
necessary."
"In this regard, the maturity of the CMS is 
reassessed annually using quantitative and qualitative 
checks and metrics."
"These include checking completion 
rates of mandatory online tests, for example on anti-
corruption, antitrust law, data protection and the Code of 
Conduct."
"The same applies to the number of whistleblower 
tips and other allegations received, as well as to the number, 
type and severity of compliance violations identified."
"Compliance reports are submitted to the Board of 
Management and the Audit Committee ad hoc when 
required and, that notwithstanding, every six months  
to the Board of Management and annually to the Audit 
Committee."
"Reporting also involves regularly communicating with 
supervisory authorities such as the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin)."
"Selected compliance programmes 
We have set up dedicated compliance programmes  
as minimum standards for compliance risks of Group- 
wide relevance, for example corruption and bribery, 
financial sanctions, money laundering and antitrust law, 
sales compliance and data protection."
"Monitoring the 
implementation of these programmes is the responsibility 
of the respective local compliance organisation."
"Due to its international activities, Munich Re is also subject 
to foreign corruption-prevention laws such as the UK Bribery 
Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act."
"Accordingly, 
we have adopted Group-wide minimum standards on 
appropriate conduct regarding invitations, gifts, donations 
and sponsorships, as well as on interacting with public 
officials."
"Fighting corruption is a zero-tolerance compliance 
programme at Munich Re."
"Munich Re is also committed to the fight against money 
laundering and terrorist financing."
"The companies that are 
subject to the German Money Laundering Act (GWG) have 
been set up accordingly; officers responsible for money 
laundering issues, and their deputies, have been appointed 
where mandated by the GWG."
"ERGO and MEAG have, 
through in-house anti-money-laundering policies, set up 
fundamental standards for their staff in the relevant 
companies to prevent money laundering and terrorist 
financing."
"Duly identifying our customers, service providers 
and suppliers is part of the know-your-customer principle 
and the process is integrated into corresponding due-
diligence reviews."
"Whistleblowing portal 
We maintain a Group-wide reporting system for violations 
of the law and other regulations."
"Staff can report potential 
violations to Group Compliance & Legal or their line manager."
"In addition, they have the option to contact an external, 
independent ombudsman."
"The compliance whistleblowing 
portal is available to all staff and external parties for 
reporting violations."
"This setup allows allegations to be 
reported securely, anonymously and confidentially."
"Any 
reports received are forwarded to Group Compliance & 
Legal or the relevant local compliance organisation."
"The function protecting 
whistleblower anonymity in Munich Re’s compliance 
whistleblowing portal has been externally certified under 
ISO 27001."
"Munich Re’s whistleblowing portal complies with the  
legal requirements, as amended, of the EU Whistleblowing 
Directive 2019/1937."
"Such incidents 
constitute an essential component of our reporting to  
the Boards of Management and Supervisory Board Audit 
Committees of Munich Re companies."
"In 2023, 497 (443) allegations of potential misconduct  
were received through the various reporting channels at  
Munich Re."
"All allegations were carefully and impartially 
investigated, while protecting the whistleblower  
and maintaining their anonymity, when requested."
"Neither violations with a material financial impact  
nor any systematic vulnerabilities were identified."
"Details about the allegations and violations appear  
in the following tables."
"Information about allegations  
and violations concerning data protection can be  
found under “Responsible digital transformation, data 
protection and information security”."

"The findings from our investigations of suspected and 
actual compliance violations are used to continually improve 
the CMS."
"Transformation efforts towards digital and data-driven 
processes have significantly accelerated in many insurance 
companies as well."
"It is of crucial importance for Munich Re 
to ensure that digital data and technologies are used 
responsibly, and to remain a trusted partner on the market 
by striving to offer innovative solutions for our clients."
"Against this backdrop, we have made responsible and 
ethical digitalisation an essential component of our business 
strategy, and are making targeted investments in technology 
and staff."
"Due to the nature of its business, Munich Re comes into 
contact with a large amount of data."
"Protecting this data is 
important to us, especially given the fact that increasing 
digitalisation means that many business processes involve 
handling personally identifiable information."
"Compliance 
with data protection regulations is also a significant 
element of maintaining Munich Re’s reputation and the 
trust of our business partners."
"In the area of data protection, 
compliance with national and international regulatory 
requirements such as the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) is one of the main drivers for the 
development of our management approach."
"Moreover, in 
the various fields of business, data protection management 
systems have been implemented to systematically monitor 
and control how we handle personally identifiable information."
"At the same time, we consistently apply the three pillars of 
protection to information security: confidentiality, availability 
and integrity of our information."
"The requirements in this 
regard are driven by statutory and supervisory regulations, 
and are an integral component of Munich Re’s corporate 
strategy."
"Accomplishing these protection objectives 
constitutes a key factor in our business success."
"Our goal  
in this regard is to tailor the levels of protection of our data 
and information to the respective risk, in the context of the 
increasing digitalisation of our business processes."
"When 
defining our level of ambition, we took both the findings 
from our review of supervisory requirements, for example 
the “Supervisory Requirements for IT in Insurance 
Undertakings” (VAIT), as well as benchmark comparisons 
into account."
"Munich Re’s Code of Conduct and various business-field-
specific standards include mandatory rules for all staff and 
are intended to ensure that data protection and information 
security are dealt with consistently in these areas."
"For Group companies situated within the European Union 
and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA), the rules 
regarding data protection refer primarily to the GDPR."
"Based on the GDPR, Munich Reinsurance Company, ERGO 
and MEAG have each adopted a data protection policy 
covering their activities in the EU/EEA in order to ensure a 
consistent, mandatory level of protection across these fields 
of business."
"In our reinsurance business and at MEAG, 
binding corporate rules on data protection apply for our intra-
Group data sharing with companies situated outside the 
EU/EEA, thus ensuring an appropriate level of data protection 
at our locations worldwide."
"In 2023, we implemented an 
updated version of these data protection regulations approved 
by the competent data protection supervisory authority."
"Where necessary, data protection officers have been 
appointed to handle data protection in reinsurance,  
at ERGO and at MEAG."
"The Group’s data protection 
organisation is centrally coordinated by the Group 
Compliance & Legal division."
"Reports 
are made at least once a year to Munich Reinsurance 
Company’s Board of Management concerning significant 
data protection issues and improvements to Munich Re’s 
data protection management systems."
"Particularly complex and risky data protection concerns at 
Munich Re are handled by the Data Strategy and Governance 
department, which is overseen by the Compliance and 
Legal division and serves as a centre of excellence."
"All 
Munich Re staff can contact this department if they have 
any enquiries relating to data protection and AI."
"Management of information security risks is the responsibility 
of the Group Chief Information Security Officer (Group 
CISO)."
"This involves defining, updating and implementing 
the information security strategy, which includes numerous 
measures and projects executed by the Group CISO."
"The idea of “responsible artificial intelligence” is the 
foundation of our work in the field of artificial intelligence."
"It is based on the seven Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy 
Artificial Intelligence elaborated by an expert group at the 
European Commission."
"These guidelines form the basis for 
complying with international regulatory requirements for 
using AI, in particular the EU AI Act."
"Munich Re’s main goal when using AI in reinsurance is to 
offer solutions that are tailored to our clients’ needs, for 
example by making it easier and quicker for us to assess 
risks, settle claims, or insure new types of risk."
"Moreover, 
Munich Re assumes the performance risk associated with 
 
 
Combined management report 
58 
Combined non-financial statement 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
AI-based models through innovative insurance products 
such as aiSure™."
"In primary insurance, data and artificial intelligence are also 
key factors driving digital transformation, particularly though 
intelligent process automation and strong, individualised 
client service."
"Measures 
To continuously improve our digitalisation processes,  
we implemented numerous measures in the course of the 
reporting year."
"Munich Re staff receive regular training via e-learning 
programs on the GDPR, mandatory internal data protection 
regulations, and information security."
"All new staff are also 
required to complete the e-learning programs during their 
onboarding period."
"Moreover, division-specific on-site 
courses were held in the reporting year, along with regular 
online presentations outlining the handling of data, 
analytics and AI as well as the risks and opportunities 
associated with them."
"We continue to offer training 
courses, for example our data analytics curriculum, that are 
targeted towards specific groups of staff, such as developers, 
users and managers."
"We have also expanded our training 
programme with regard to trustworthy artificial intelligence."
"In order to provide transparency about data protection risks 
and information security risks, and to fulfil data protection 
accountability obligations, every instance of IT-supported 
processing of personally identifiable information in 
reinsurance is reviewed using a defined process."
"Any data 
processing that entails a high risk of violating an 
individual’s rights or restricting their freedoms is identified 
and monitored through a privacy impact assessment."
"ERGO and MEAG also comply with their accountability 
obligations under data protection law with the help of 
corresponding processes."
"In addition to the aforementioned 
data protection risk reviews, every instance of IT-supported 
data processing is reviewed – according to the protection 
needs of the processed data – for compliance with 
information security requirements."
"The data protection and 
information security processes are continually refined, also 
with respect to technical and legal developments."
"In 2023, 
we introduced an overarching governance, risk and 
compliance platform in reinsurance and integrated the data 
protection and information security processes in the affiliated 
Group companies."
"We also plan to integrate our existing 
third-party risk management approach into the platform."
"It is our declared goal to avoid any type of discrimination 
through AI, which could for example arise through the use 
of historical data."
"In addition, we check that our data 
resources cover all relevant demographic groups where 
possible, for example regarding age, sex, nationality or 
ethnic background."
"At the same time, we bear in mind the 
legal, social and cultural standards of every country in 
which we do business."
"Moreover, making our algorithms as 
transparent as possible is a matter we take very seriously."
"Through partnerships with the scientific community and 
academic institutions, we have access to the latest 
techniques for illustrating the behaviour of AI systems."
"Appraisal 
In 2023, as in the previous year, no material data protection 
events as defined in the Solvency II Group Compliance 
Policy were identified anywhere in our Group worldwide, nor 
were any material proceedings for breach of data protection 
regulations initiated."
"Nevertheless, Munich Re is increasingly 
the target of cyber attacks, which threaten the confidentiality, 
integrity and availability of our information and business 
processes."
"As a result, measures that both prevent such 
attacks and facilitate their identification are being continually 
improved, particularly in this area."
"We are also optimising the 
systematic management of any such incidents."
"Further details 
In the following section, we publish further information 
under the German Commercial Code (HGB) about our 
business model, our management’s involvement, and about 
non-financial risks and how we manage them, to provide a 
fuller understanding of the sustainability of our actions."
"Details on the business model 
Munich Re is one of the world’s leading providers of 
reinsurance, primary insurance and insurance-related risk 
solutions."
"The information about Munich Re’s business 
model, required under Sections 289c(1) and 315c(1) HGB, is 
published under “Munich Re Group”."
"Sustainability governance structure 
We have clearly defined organisational responsibilities for 
sustainability throughout the Group."
"Fundamental strategic 
decisions are taken by the Board of Management, or,  
more specifically, by the ESG Committee, a subcommittee 
of the Strategy Committee."
"The members of the Strategy  
 
 
Combined management report 
59 
Combined non-financial statement 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Committee are part of the ESG Committee, as is the head 
of the central division Economics, Sustainability & Public 
Affairs (ESP)."
"The ESG Committee’s objective is to 
strengthen the Group’s ESG management and accentuate 
the strategic importance of ESG topics for the Group."
"The 
ESG Management Team is responsible for implementing 
and monitoring the Group-wide ESG strategy."
"Both bodies 
are supported by the Group’s Sustainability department, 
part of the central division ESP, which reports directly to 
the CEO and coordinates sustainability initiatives within 
the Group."
"In addition, we have been integrating ESG criteria into  
the Board of Management’s remuneration system since 
2012."
"This grants the Supervisory Board latitude to  
factor in aspects of sustainability when it considers 
remuneration."
"And as of the 2022 reporting year, at least 
one concrete ESG target is to be agreed for the multi- 
year bonus."
"Further information is available online at 
www.munichre.com/board-of-management."
"The Supervisory Board addresses significant sustainability 
issues at least three times a year: on the basis of the 
combined non-financial statement, upon presentation of 
the annual personnel report, and through regular updates 
on ESG strategy and implementation measures."
"Such 
updates are based on the report detailing the work of the 
Praesidium and Sustainability Committee and other 
information."
"Several members of the Supervisory Board 
possess significant ESG expertise and are thus qualified  
to assess the information."
"Moreover, the Praesidium and 
Sustainability Committee regularly scrutinises ESG issues 
as a fundamental part of its responsibility."
"Further 
information on the Supervisory Board’s responsibilities and 
those of its committees can be found under “Report of the 
Supervisory Board”."
"Risk analysis 
For us as risk carriers, risk management constitutes a key 
element of responsible and sustainable corporate governance."
"In the context of sustainability risks, we differentiate between 
“outside-in” and “inside-out” perspectives."
"Outside-in risks 
refer to ESG events or conditions that could have real or 
potential negative consequences on investments or 
liabilities."
"We address the management of outside-in risks 
under “Risk report”."
"By contrast, inside-out risks are potential consequences 
that our business could have on ESG aspects, and thus 
correspond to the risks mentioned in Sections 289c(3) and 
315c HGB – risks to society and the environment, for example."
"Munich Re’s business operations, unlike those of other 
sectors, do not normally result in any material risks that 
could very likely have grave consequences for the aspects 
named in Section 289c(2) HGB."
"Nevertheless, risks that 
can be categorised as sustainability risks may indirectly 
arise from investments or our insurance business, e.g."
"through 
covering major infrastructure projects."
"We are aware of our corporate responsibility for these risks, 
and manage them accordingly."
"We describe our strategic 
approach to sustainability, and how we handle specific ESG 
aspects such as climate change, in various sections of the 
non-financial statement."
"Non-compliance with ESG criteria could also damage 
Munich Re’s reputation."
"As a result, where societal and 
environmental risks are not already subject to specific 
operational standards, they are assessed by our reputational 
risk management and rejected if necessary."
"We identify, 
analyse, assess and monitor reputational risks with the aid 
of qualitative methods."
"Specific guidelines and process 
descriptions define how we deal with reputational and 
sustainability risks."
"Various measures raise our staff’s 
awareness of reputational and ESG considerations, which in 
turn helps to mitigate risks."
"Reputational risk committees 
(RRCs) in the fields of investment, reinsurance and primary 
insurance (in the latter case called the Reputation and 
Integrity Committee) assess concrete reputational 
concerns and any potential reputational or sustainability 
risks of individual transactions."
"The reviewed incidents are 
documented."
"Our processes on dealing with reputational 
risks in the various fields of business’ individual RRCs have 
been consistent across the Group since 2021."
"The figures 
in the tables illustrate the findings and the development  
of the reputational and sustainability risks reviewed by the 
RRCs for the 2023 financial year and the previous year."

"About this statement 
Statutory requirements 
In the combined non-financial statement, we report in 
accordance with the requirements of the European Non-
Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and the corresponding 
commercial law provisions of Sections 289b and 315b HGB."
"This statement combines the consolidated non-financial 
statement of the Munich Re Group and the non-financial 
statement of Munich Reinsurance Company."
"All content 
contained in the statement applies both to the Group and 
to Munich Reinsurance Company, unless otherwise noted."
"In preparing the non-financial statement, we bore in mind 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards when 
describing the concepts."
"An exhaustive report is published 
separately in the Sustainability Report, which is available at 
www.munichre.com/s-report."
"Moreover, our sustainability reports have followed the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2020."
"In the risk report, 
which includes a more detailed description of non-financial 
risks, our reporting on risks for insurance and investments 
resulting from climate change is also based on the TCFD 
recommendations."
"We have also been using the standards issued by the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) as 
guidance in compiling the non-financial statement since 
2021 – as acknowledgement of the increasing significance 
of SASB standards to investors."
"An overview of the relevant information about the TCFD 
and the SASB can be found in the TCFD, SASB Index at 
www.munichre.com/sustainability/download."
"Our goal is to continue improving the transparency of our 
reporting and to keep meeting updated requirements."
"Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was 
tasked with the assurance audit of our combined non-financial 
statement in 2023."
"All information in this statement was 
subjected to a limited assurance audit."
"Any references to 
information outside the combined management report 
constitute outside information and are thus not part of the 
combined non-financial statement; they are not covered by 
the audit."
"Materiality analysis 
The materiality analysis determines which sustainability 
topics are of special importance for Munich Re and its 
stakeholders, and therefore should be focused on in our 
sustainability management and reporting."
"In order to 
comply with both regulatory standards and best practices 
in our reporting, we conducted a validation of the previous 
materiality analysis to identify the material topics to be 
reported on for the 2023 reporting year."
"The materiality 
analysis that we completed was based on the concept of 
materiality as defined by Section 289c HGB."
"The following stakeholder groups were included in the 
analysis: 
− Clients 
− Staff 
− Investors 
− Representatives of wider society 
 
The validation confirmed the reporting scope from 2022."
"Human rights was identified as material from both an impact 
and business relevance perspective."
"EU Taxonomy Regulation templates

"With a net result of 
€4.6bn for the full year, we exceeded our guidance despite 
a market environment that remains challenging."
"Insurance 
revenue from insurance contracts issued (insurance revenue) 
rose by 4.5% to €57,884m (55,385m)."
"This considerable 
increase was due in particular to organic growth both in the 
property-casualty reinsurance segment and at ERGO; 
conversely, currency translation effects negatively impacted 
insurance revenue."
"The property-casualty reinsurance segment contributed 
€2,448m (3,423m) to our net result of €4,597m (5,309m)."
"The decline year on year was chiefly due to interest-rate 
developments."
"Although our insurance service result 
benefited to a similar extent from discounting effects on 
reserves in both reporting periods, the previous year was 
affected significantly more by the lower interest rates 
applied upon initial measurement."
"This resulted in 
substantially lower expenses for accrued interest (insurance 
finance expenses)."
"The combined ratio amounted to 85.2% 
(83.2%) of net insurance revenue, and was thus in line with 
the adjusted forecast of 85%."
"Major-loss expenditure 
totalled €3,278m (3,741m)1."
"Major-loss expenditure 
corresponded to 12.6% (15.4%)1 of net insurance revenue, 
and was thus below the expected value of 14%."
"Man-made 
major losses amounted to €943m (1,623m)1."
"Major losses 
from natural catastrophes rose to €2,335m, (2,118m)1."
"The 
largest individual loss for Munich Re in 2023 was the 
earthquake in Turkey, with a nominal value of around €0.7bn."
"1 
The figure is only comparable to a limited extent with the same period last year, 
as we raised the major-loss threshold to €30m on 1 January 2023(previous 
years: €10m)."
"Life and health reinsurance contributed €1,428m (1,314m) to 
the net result, thus exceeding the previous year’s result."
"The 
total technical result amounted to €1,433m (1,041m), within 
the adjusted expected range."
"The ERGO field of business contributed €721m (572m) to 
the net result, substantially surpassing the previous year’s 
result and meeting our target for the financial year of 
approx."
"This increase year on year was chiefly 
attributable to operational improvements."
"Insurance revenue 
rose in all three segments, with the ERGO International 
segment contributing the most to revenue growth."
"The 
ERGO Life and Health Germany segment’s net result 
amounted to €183m (307m)."
"This development was due 
primarily to lower income from the release of the contractual 
service margin in the life insurance and long-term health 
business."
"This was partly offset by an increase in the 
insurance service result from short-term health and travel 
business."
"The ERGO Property-Casualty Germany segment’s 
contribution to the net result increased substantially to 
€252m (173m)."
"This increase was possible due to good 
operational development, lower major-loss expenditure, and 
a significantly higher investment result."
"Thanks to very 
profitable growth and substantially improved underwriting 
performance, ERGO International was able to significantly 
increase its net result to €286m (92m)."
"Moreover, the 
segment’s result had been impacted by one-off effects in 
the previous year."
"Munich Re’s investment result was €5,374m (2,983m)."
"Overall, this represents a return of 2.5% (1.3%) on the 
average market value of the portfolio."
"Net 
unrealised losses on investments dropped sharply due to 
interest-rate developments."
"Geopolitical tensions were exacerbated  
in 2023 and continued to pose challenges for the entire 
insurance industry."
"Despite the unfavourable environment, Munich Re’s 
performance was very encouraging."
"After Q3, we were able 
to raise the result targets announced in early 2023: the 
annual target for our net result, our profit guidance for  
the reinsurance field of business and the target for total 
technical result in the life and health reinsurance segment."
"What is more, favourable claims experience allowed us to 
improve our forecast for the combined ratio in property-
casualty reinsurance."
"At the beginning of the year, we had projected insurance 
revenue of around €58bn for Munich Re during the 2023 
financial year."
"Generating insurance revenue of €57.9bn, 
we reached our target."
"At the beginning of the year, we had anticipated a net 
result of around €4.0bn for the 2023 financial year – which 
was raised to €4.5bn following Q3 due to positive business 
performance in the reinsurance field of business."
"Despite 
geopolitical and macroeconomic turbulence, we were able 
to exceed our profit target, posting profits of €4.6bn."
"This 
result is attributable to pleasing operational performance in 
our segments."
"At the beginning of the year, we had forecast a return on 
investment of above 2.2%."
"Due to the continued rise in 
interest rates, regular income from interest-bearing 
securities increased more than expected."
"This effect was 
compounded by generally favourable conditions on the 
stock markets, and by the fact that, under IFRS 9, price 
increases are recognised in full in the net result."
"Losses on 
derivatives to hedge against interest-rate and equity risk 
had a detrimental impact on the result."
"For the Group, this 
amounted to a return of 2.5% on the average market value 
of our portfolio."
"Accordingly, we surpassed our target."
"For the 2023 financial year, we had expected economic 
earnings of over €4.0bn and exceeded this target by a wide 
margin with a figure of €5.6bn."
"Both our fields of business 
reported positive value added by new business, with the 
reinsurance field of business also reporting distinctly positive 
variances."
Major-loss expenditure was lower than expected.
"The development of important capital market parameters 
also had a positive effect on the result."
"Foreign currency 
losses were offset by gains from credit risk premiums and 
rising share prices in light of falling interest rates."
"Reinsurance 
At the beginning of the financial year, we had aimed for 
insurance revenue of around €39bn for the reinsurance 
field of business."
"We adjusted this forecast to €38bn after 
Q3 due to changes in exchange rates."
"At €37.8bn, we were 
able to reach the adjusted target."
"The growth in insurance revenue, primarily in property-
casualty reinsurance, was due to an expansion of existing 
business across almost all lines and regions; however, this 
year the effect was partly offset by negative currency 
translation effects, particularly in connection with the 
US dollar."
"The main growth drivers were the expansion of 
existing business and the acquisition of new business with 
selected clients – particularly in our primary insurance units 
in North America – and growth in Europe, South America, 
Asia and Australia."
"At the same time, we made a conscious 
decision to discontinue business that failed to meet our 
expectations with regard to pricing or conditions."
"At the beginning of the year, we had projected a total 
technical result of around €1bn in life and health reinsurance."
"Owing to the gratifying business performance in Q3 in 
particular, we significantly raised our expectation for the 
full-year total technical result to about €1.4bn."
"At €1.4bn, 
we were able to reach this target."
"At the beginning of the financial year, our declared  
goal was to achieve a combined ratio of 86% of net

insurance revenue in property-casualty reinsurance."
"Upon 
communicating the Q3 results, we reduced this target to 
around 85% owing to the positive business development."
"At the end of the reporting year, the ratio was, at 85.2%,  
in line with the revised target."
"Amounting to 12.6% of net 
insurance revenue, major-loss expenditure was below our 
expectation of 14%1."
"At €3.9bn, the net result for reinsurance as a whole in 2023 
was above the forecast, which we had raised from €3.3bn to 
€3.8bn after Q3."
"ERGO 
For the ERGO field of business, we had projected insurance 
revenue of around €19bn at the beginning of the year."
"Following good business performance in the first nine 
months of the year, we increased our target for the full  
year to €20bn."
"With insurance revenue of €20.1bn, we 
marginally surpassed the revised target."
"1 
The figure is only comparable to a limited extent with the same period last year, 
as we raised the major-loss threshold to €30m on 1 January 2023(previous 
years: €10m)."
"At the beginning of the year, we forecast a combined ratio 
of around 89% in the ERGO Property-casualty Germany 
segment – assuming that major losses remained within 
normal bounds."
"As major losses were in line with 
expectations overall, the combined ratio at the end of the 
year was slightly better than expected at 88.9% thanks  
to consistently high premium growth and the favourable 
development of basic losses."
"In the segment ERGO International, we had aimed for a 
combined ratio of around 90% at the beginning of the year, 
provided major losses remained within normal bounds."
"Due 
to positive operational development overall, we achieved 
our forecast at 90.1%."
"At the beginning of the year, we had anticipated that the 
ERGO field of business would contribute around €0.7bn to 
the net result."
"With its result of €721m, ERGO matched our 
expectations."

Notably, the classification overlay approach applied to business with direct 
participation features in ERGO life and health insurance."
"Munich Re’s insurance revenue from insurance contracts 
issued (insurance revenue) of €57,884m was significantly 
higher year on year (€55,385m)."
"This is due in particular to 
organic growth both in the property-casualty reinsurance 
segment and at ERGO; conversely, currency translation 
effects negatively impacted insurance revenue."
"The substantial decrease in the currency result to –€292m 
(1,067m) was chiefly attributable to the currency gains 
against the US dollar in 2022."
"Munich Re’s effective tax rate in the reporting year 
amounted to 16.9% (20.0%), which was affected by positive 
one-off effects."
"Economic earnings are mainly attributable to factors from 
new and in-force business deriving from underwriting,  
and to the impact of capital market parameters on assets 
and liabilities."
"Favourable operational value creation in 
reinsurance and primary insurance, with lower-than-
expected major-loss expenditure, had a positive influence on 
economic earnings."
"Developments in the capital markets 
had an overall positive impact on economic earnings in the 
financial year."
"Depreciation of key foreign currencies gave

"These were offset by positive

rates, and as a result of the positive contribution from credit 
risk premiums."

"Regular income increased on the previous year, primarily 
due to higher interest rates and a consequently higher 
reinvestment yield."
"The average reinvestment yield1 in the 
financial year was 4.5% (2.8%)."
"Higher interest rates in the 
reporting year resulted in yields on new investments that 
were above the average return on our existing portfolio of 
fixed-interest investments."
"The net result from write-ups and write-downs was 
substantially less negative than in the same period of the 
previous year."
"Impairment losses on equities, which had a 
very negative impact on write-downs in 2022, are recognised 
as changes in fair value under IFRS 9."
"Moreover, no further 
write-downs of Russian or Ukrainian bonds were made in the 
2023 reporting year."
"Impairment losses on both property and 
participations was the primary reason for the negative result."
"The result from the change in expected credit losses amounted 
to –€47m in the reporting year."
"Introduced in IFRS 9 as its 
own category, “Expected credit losses” reflect anticipated 
losses on interest-bearing investments that are not posted

Hedging costs for securities in foreign currency are not considered.
"We posted net losses in the reporting year of €588m on  
the disposal of investments not recognised under “Fair-
value changes”."
"These losses resulted primarily from the 
disposal of fixed-interest securities that were sold and 
whose proceeds were then invested anew so as to profit 
from higher interest rates."
"In the same period of 2022, it 
was possible to generate profits through the disposal of

"The net result from fair-value changes totalled –€65m, with 
the key negative variable being the result from derivatives of 
–€622m – in turn mainly attributable to losses from equity 
derivatives used to hedge against bearish equity markets."
"This was positively offset by a boost of €1,067m to the 
result owing to changes in the fair values of equities due to 
stronger equity markets."
"In the same period of the previous 
year, higher interest rates in particular had a detrimental 
impact on the relevant fixed-interest securities."

"We write the majority

"Exchange-rate fluctuations therefore have a significant 
impact on revenue development."
"If exchange rates had remained unchanged, our insurance 
revenue would have remained largely constant (−0.2%) 
compared with the previous year."
"Revenue was down in  
our business in continental Europe, mainly due to a large-
volume treaty, and also in Asia and Australia."
"This was 
largely compensated for by growth in North America and 
the United Kingdom."
"The very pleasing growth in our financially motivated 
reinsurance is not reflected in the insurance revenue, as the 
majority of new contracts are presented in the result from 
insurance-related financial instruments."
"Result 
The total technical result improved significantly as against 
the previous year, bringing it into line with our guidance for 
the reporting year, which we had raised after Q3."
"The total technical result is comprised of the insurance 
service result and the result from insurance-related financial 
instruments."
"The insurance service result is substantially driven by  
the release of the contractual service margin and the risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk."
"Overall, claims expenditure in the US portfolio was higher 
than expected, driven by mortality risk business."
"Otherwise, 
underwriting performance in our core markets was positive."
"New business developed very favourably and made a positive 
contribution to the result."
"The improvement in underwriting 
conditions for a number of current contracts coupled with 
the annual review of our reserve position also had a positive 
effect on the insurance service result."
"The result from insurance-related financial instruments is 
largely determined by that part of our financially motivated 
reinsurance that does not transfer significant insurance risk."
"The portfolio continues to show very encouraging growth, 
with results from the contracts that are in line with 
expectations."
"The result was influenced by changing 
economic parameters, in particular exchange rates, which are 
not reported as part of the currency result for this business."
"During the reporting period, they produced a negative effect."
"The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine did not 
have any direct impact on the segment’s total technical 
result."
"The impact of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel 
was negligible in the reporting year."
The investment result was up year on year.
"Whilst realised 
losses on fixed-interest investments had a negative impact 
on the result, higher interest rates boosted the reinvestment

yield, thus improving regular income."
"Equities also made  
a positive contribution to the investment result thanks to 
the good market development, unlike in the previous year, 
when the result had been hit by impairment losses on fixed-
interest securities and equities."
"Our individual core markets 
Based on insurance revenue, around 50% of our reinsurance 
business is written in North America, with the USA 
accounting for approximately 35% and thus ranking before 
Canada."
"Some further 25% of our insurance revenue stems 
from Europe, with approximately 20% generated in the 
United Kingdom and Ireland."
"Another significant share of 
around 20% stems from Asia and the MENA (Middle East, 
North Africa) region."
"Australia and New Zealand contribute 
around 5% to insurance revenue."
"We are also well 
positioned in Africa and Latin America, but due to the small 
size of the markets their share of our global business is small."
"In the USA, insurance revenue increased to about €4.0bn 
(3.8bn) despite negative currency translation effects."
"We 
therefore continue to be one of the most important reinsurers 
in this market, which is the largest worldwide."
"The insurance 
service result was lower than expected due to higher 
mortality claims."
"By contrast, the result from insurance-
related financial instruments again showed encouraging 
development."
"We continue to be very satisfied with the 
development of our new business, both in terms of volume 
and profitability."
"In Canada, insurance revenue increased slightly to €1.3bn 
(1.2bn)."
"Once again, exchange rates had a negative impact 
on development."
"The insurance service result developed 
very well."
"In Europe, on the other hand, insurance revenue dropped  
to €2.6bn (2.8bn), with €2.2bn (2.1bn) stemming from the 
United Kingdom and Ireland."
"Our longevity business 
continued to expand very pleasingly, boosting insurance 
revenue."
"By contrast, a large-volume treaty had a negative 
impact on insurance revenue, albeit without any material 
impact on profit or loss."
"We are highly satisfied with our 
total technical result."
"Insurance revenue in Asia/MENA decreased to €2.0bn 
(2.2bn)."
"Alongside exchange rate developments, the deciding 
factor in this trend was the termination of a number of 
contractual relationships, which had a minor impact on 
profit or loss."
"New business was again at a very gratifying 
level."
"This included the expansion of our financially 
motivated reinsurance business, the majority of which is 
posted as part of the result from insurance-related financial 
instruments."
"The total technical result outstripped our 
expectations and made a disproportionately high contribution 
to the net result from this segment."
"The insurance revenue generated by our business activities 
in Australia and New Zealand fell to €578m (726m)."
"This 
includes negative exchange-rate effects."
"Our main focus 
remains the rehabilitation of our existing portfolio; currently, 
we are very selective regarding the writing of new business."
"The total technical result was positive and in line with our 
expectations."
"This reflects the benefits of the rehabilitation 
measures we have taken in recent years."

"Insurance revenue 
Our insurance revenue from insurance contracts issued 
(insurance revenue) in property-casualty reinsurance was up 
6.9% on the previous year, although changes in exchange 
rates had a negative impact on revenue development."
"12% 
of the portfolio is written in euros and 88% in foreign 
currency, of which around 60 percentage points is in 
US dollars and around 8 percentage points in pounds 
sterling."
"If exchange rates had remained unchanged, 
insurance revenue would have risen by 10.3% year on year."
"The substantial increase in insurance revenue was due to 
an expansion of business across almost all lines and 
regions."
"The main drivers were the expansion of existing 
and acquisition of new business with selected clients – 
particularly in our primary insurance units in North America."
"We realised growth in reinsurance business with natural 
hazard exposure above all in Europe, South America, Asia 
and Australia."
"Prices at the reinsurance contract renewals in 2023 
developed positively overall, and for the most part more than 
compensated for the significantly higher loss estimates in 
some areas – owing especially to inflation or other loss 
trends."
"Risk-adjusted prices rose slightly, especially in 
regions affected by natural catastrophes."
"Primary insurance 
prices also climbed in many markets."
"Overall, price gains 
were evident around the world to varying degrees."
"For 
Munich Re, risk-adjusted prices for the 2023 renewals 
increased by approximately 3.1%."
"1 
The data above on major losses was calculated to include the effects of 
discounting and risk adjustments, unless the explanatory notes indicate that this 
is a nominal amount."
"Quality continues to play an important role in the selection 
of reinsurers."
"This allows financially solid reinsurers to 
position themselves as reliable long-term partners."
"Overall, 
we are adhering to our clearly profit-oriented underwriting 
policy."
"Result1 
The net result and the total technical result in property-
casualty reinsurance worsened year on year, despite lower 
major losses."
"The lower net result was due in particular to 
the drop in the net financial result."
"In the previous year, this 
figure had been affected significantly more by the lower 
interest rates applied upon initial measurement and the 
substantially lower expenses for accrued interest (insurance 
finance expenses) as a result."
"Adjusted for commissions, 
Munich Re’s customary review of its provisions resulted  
in a reduction in the basic claims provisions for prior years 
of €1,308m for the full year, which is equivalent to 
5.0 percentage points of the combined ratio."
"This positive 
development extended to almost all lines in our portfolio."
The safety margin in the provisions increased year on year.
"Major losses – in excess of €30m each – totalled €3,278m 
(3,741m)2 after retrocession and before tax."
"This amount 
includes run-off profits and losses for major claims from 
previous years, and is equivalent to 12.6% (15.4%) of net 
insurance revenue."
"Expenditure was lower than in the 
previous year and also less than our major-loss expectation 
of 14% of net insurance revenue."
"2 
The figure is only comparable to a limited extent with the same period last year, 
as the major-loss threshold was raised to €30m with effect from 1 January 2023 
(previous years: €10m)."
"Combined management report 
79 
Business performance 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Man-made major losses totalling €943m (1,623m)1 were 
down on the previous year."
"The decline is due, among other 
things, to expenditure from the previous year in connection 
with Russia’s war against Ukraine."
"Expenditure for man-
made major losses was equivalent to 3.6% (6.7%) of net 
insurance revenue."
"The number of losses above our major-
loss threshold was similar to the previous year."
"Major losses from natural catastrophes totalled €2,335m 
(2,118m)1, equivalent to 9.0% (8.7%) of net insurance 
revenue."
"The highest natural catastrophe losses of the  
year occurred in Europe; the largest individual loss was  
the earthquake in Turkey, with a nominal amount of  
around €0.7bn."
"In addition, there were a number of flood, 
thunderstorm and storm events, particularly in North 
America, Mexico and Europe."
"The combined ratio increased to 85.2% (83.2%) despite 
lower major-loss expenditure and higher insurance 
revenue, mostly as a result of prudent reserving."
"On the one 
hand, insurance service expenses (net) totalled €22,187m 
(20,251m); on the other, insurance revenue (net) amounted 
to €26,036m (24,344m)."
"The investment result was up €1,097m on the previous 
year."
"Whilst realised losses on fixed-interest investments 
had a negative impact on the result, higher interest rates 
boosted the reinvestment yield, thus improving regular 
income."
"Equities, thanks to the good market development, 
and alternative investments also made positive contributions 
to the investment result, unlike in the previous year,  
when the result had been hit by impairment losses on 
fixed-interest securities and equities."
"Our individual core markets and selected 
special lines 
Based on insurance revenue, around 40% of our global 
property-casualty reinsurance business is written in North 
America."
"Around 40% of our revenue comes from Europe, 
of which around 15% is generated in the United Kingdom."
"Further substantial shares were contributed by Asia and 
Australia/New Zealand (about 15%), and by Africa and 
Latin America (approximately 5%)."
"Prices in the US reinsurance market have continued to 
improve, particularly in property insurance."
"Major losses 
from natural catastrophes were below expectations due  
to the below-average impact of hurricanes."
"In the year under review, insurance revenue for US reinsurance 
business decreased despite new business and the positive 
market environment as a consequence of selective portfolio 
restructuring and quota share reductions."
"The result for 
US reinsurance business was up on that of the previous year 
owing to higher prices and lower major losses."
"1 
The figure is only comparable to a limited extent with the same period last year, 
as the major-loss threshold was raised to €30m with effect from 1 January 2023 
(previous years: €10m)."
"In Canada, we are represented by the Munich Reinsurance 
Company of Canada and Temple Insurance Company."
"By 
virtue of the positive market environment, insurance 
revenue rose further to €551m (507m)."
"The result for 2023 
is pleasing, as in the past."
"Insurance revenue in the United Kingdom and in continental 
Europe increased significantly year on year to €3,941m 
(3,061m)."
"In many markets, this was realised through the 
targeted development of business with selected clients and 
the acquisition of profitable new business."
"Thanks to a 
favourable environment, high growth rates were achieved 
in almost all markets – particularly through the expansion 
of business exposed to natural hazards."
"We posted the 
greatest boosts in insurance revenue in Italy, growing to 
€636m (508m); in Spain, climbing to €473m (378m); and 
in France, rising to €216m (146m)."
"At our Swiss subsidiary, New Reinsurance Company Ltd., 
property-casualty business volume increased to €1,316m 
(556m)."
"In particular, profitable traditional business was 
significantly supplemented by expanding existing client 
relationships, and by new business."
"Insurance revenue in Australia and New Zealand increased 
considerably to €1,431m (886m), continuing the ongoing 
growth trend seen in recent years."
"Business in Japan, which is aligned strongly with natural 
hazard risks, benefited from price increases that led to 
insurance revenue improving further to €519m (511m)."
"Revenue in China has been increased on an ongoing basis 
in recent years."
"Nevertheless, it dropped slightly, partially 
because we withdrew from unprofitable business."
"Insurance 
revenue came to €676m (699m)."
"India continued on its profitable growth path, with 
insurance revenue climbing to €626m (444m)."
"In the Caribbean, Central America and South America, we 
still provide high capacity for the coverage of risks from 
natural hazards, in particular windstorms and earthquakes."
"Owing to major losses from natural catastrophes (hurricanes, 
floods, earthquakes and wildfires) in recent years, demand 
remained elevated in the year under review."
"We took 
systematic advantage of this situation to further optimise 
our portfolio."
"This enabled us to grow the already high 
insurance revenue attained in recent years to €1,153m (761m) 
and to achieve a further margin improvement."
"In agricultural insurance in the North American market, our 
insurance revenue remained at a high level of €1,093m 
(987m)."
"This line of business was expanded further in South 
America and India in particular."
"The generally positive result 
 
 
Combined management report

was negatively impacted by drought and price decreases in 
the USA."
"Buoyed by a market that remained positive, insurance 
revenue in marine reinsurance increased by around 9% to 
€1,544m (1,411m), which was also reflected in a good result."
"At €892m (732m), credit and bond reinsurance saw 
significant year-on-year insurance revenue growth."
"Whilst 
traditional credit business generated a moderate rise, this 
growth was again attributable to profitable new business in 
specialty and niche segments."
"The market environment in direct industrial insurance 
continues to be attractive."
"Renewals in the market 
continued to be characterised by price gains and new 
business."
"We were therefore able to maintain high 
insurance revenue in direct business generated by our 
Facultative & Corporate unit, totalling €1,721m (1,599m)."
"The result was gratifying thanks to the price level and 
incurred losses that were in line with expectations."
"Insurance revenue in aviation and space reinsurance  
grew to €866m (800m) in a positive market environment."
"The result this year was below that expected due to the 
development of major losses from previous years."
"Our Capital Partners division offers clients a broad range  
of structured individual reinsurance and capital market 
products, as well as parametric and derivative solutions to 
hedge against weather and other risks."
"Agricultural clients 
likewise use these solutions."
"We have used Capital 
Partners’ services for our own purposes: to buy retrocession 
cover on the basis of our defined risk strategy and to 
implement the Corporate Retrocession Strategy for 2023."
"Since the start of 2023, the majority of the former Risk 
Solutions units have been brought together in the new 
Global Specialty Insurance (GSI) division; please refer to 
the information under Munich Re Group > The property-
casualty reinsurance divisions."
"Revenue increased to 
€7,961m (7,224m)."
"In terms of business development, GSI 
benefited from its successful business expansion and 
heightened prices."
"Thanks to a low-impact hurricane 
season, major losses from natural catastrophes remained 
within the range anticipated, even though the number of 
storm losses in the USA moved up."
"New business and higher prices also contributed to 
insurance revenue at American Modern growing to 
€1,993m (1,730m)."
"Its result, by contrast, was below 
expectations as a consequence of the high number of 
smaller natural catastrophes that heavily impacted the 
entire US primary insurance market."
"HSB bolstered its 
insurance revenue somewhat to €1,315m (1,191m) while  
at the same time reducing its exposure to cyber risks  
in this recently burgeoning line of business."
"The HSB  
result waxed once again, exceeding expectations."
"Owing to growth in several products and generally good 
market conditions, MRSI boosted its insurance revenue  
to €2,664m (2,354m)."
"Despite wildfires on Maui, MRSI’s 
result benefited from low major losses from natural 
catastrophes, as the 2023 hurricane season in particular 
was comparatively calm."
"MRSG was borne up by the 
ongoing favourable market situation and increased its 
insurance revenue to €2,143m (2,089m)."
"Its result came  
in above that of the previous year despite high claims 
expenditure from several satellite losses."

"With regard to 
insurance revenue from insurance contracts issued 
(insurance revenue) approximately 62% derives from 
Health Germany, around 29% from Life Germany and 
approximately 9% from Digital Ventures."
"This segment’s insurance revenue in the 2023 financial year 
was higher than in the previous year – primarily due to 
positive development in the Health Germany division, in short-
term and long-term health business, and in travel insurance."
"The Digital Ventures division also generated higher 
insurance revenue; the Life Germany division’s contribution 
to insurance revenue changed little year on year."
"Result 
The total technical result was virtually the same as in the 
previous year for the ERGO Life and Health Germany 
segment."
"The net financial result decreased year on year, partially on 
account of the above-mentioned compensating effect from 
financial reinsurance."
"The increase in the investment result 
was particularly attributable to the 2022 result having been 
impacted by high impairment losses on some of our fixed-
interest securities due to rising interest rates."
"The investment 
result was also buoyed by greater regular income and 
considerably more favourable trends in equity markets 
compared to the previous year."
"The investment result, the 
investment result for unit-linked life insurance, and the 
currency result were largely offset by insurance finance 
income or expenses within the net financial result."
"Declining interest rates in the capital markets during the 
financial year and the associated drop in income from the 
release of the contractual service margin were primarily 
responsible for the lower net result in the ERGO Life and 
Health Germany segment."

3.0% to €6,118m (5,939m), with increases in both long-
term and short-term health business."
"Travel insurance, 
which was up by 16.5% year on year, was also a contributor 
to higher insurance revenue in Health Germany."
"The total technical result amounted to €448m (491m), with 
the year-on-year difference mainly driven by lower income 
from the release of the contractual service margin."
"Conversely, short-term travel and health insurance boosted 
the total technical result thanks to very good growth."

"Compared with the previous year, insurance revenue rose

motor (12.5%)."
"This segment also managed to generate 
higher insurance revenue in Other classes of business – 
especially in engineering (14.0%) and in fire and property 
insurance (3.4%)."
"We experienced declines in insurance 
revenue of 12.9% in marine insurance and 1.5% in legal 
protection insurance."
"Result 
Our total technical result of €495m was far above the 
previous year’s result (400m), owing primarily to strong 
operational performance and a lower major-loss burden."
"Lower expenditure due to greater discounting effects that 
resulted from interest rate developments likewise boosted 
the total technical result."
"The combined ratio improved by 
1.4 percentage points year on year; this very good 
performance was attributable to the above-mentioned 
influencing factors."
"As insurance revenue increased 
significantly, the loss ratio fell year on year and the expense 
ratio rose only slightly."
"Insurance service expenses (net) 
totalled €3,976m (3,729m); insurance revenue (net) amounted 
to €4,471m (4,128m)."
"The net financial result rose year on year – particularly  
on account of the substantially higher investment result, 
mostly owing to higher regular income and significantly 
improved results from equities."

finance income/expenses declined due to a combination  
of interest rate developments and higher interest accrual."

increase in insurance revenue – due especially to strong 
growth in Poland, improvements in health business in Spain 
and Belgium, and the full consolidation of the property-
casualty insurer ERGO Insurance (Thailand) Public Co."
"Adjusted for the purchase and sale of 
companies outside Germany and positive currency translation 
effects, insurance revenue in the segment rose by 11.0% 
compared with 2022."
"In international property-casualty business, insurance 
revenue rose by 18.8% to €3,487m (2,934m)."
"We generated 
significantly higher revenue in Poland and the Baltic states in 
particular."
"Owing to the full consolidation of ERGO Thailand, 
insurance revenue increased by €186m year on year."
"Compared to 2022, insurance revenue in international 
health business rose by 15.2% to €1,687m (1,464m) thanks 
to the strong growth of our Spanish health insurer and 
positive development in Belgium."
"Insurance revenue in international life insurance amounted

previous year."
"There were pleasing improvements in Poland 
and the Baltic states, but decreases in Belgium and Austria."
"Result 
The total technical result improved most remarkably 
compared with the previous year, chiefly on account of an 
increase in health insurance business in Spain and Belgium 
as well as improved performance of property-casualty 
business in Poland, Greece and the Baltic states."
"However, 
income from the release of the contractual service margin 
was slightly lower in life and health business."
"The combined ratio in international property-casualty 
business, including short-term health business, improved 
markedly by 5.4 percentage points compared to the 
previous year."
"Both the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
decreased, despite being affected slightly by the full

Spanish health business."

totalled €3,813m (3,398m); insurance revenue (net) amounted 
to €4,231m (3,559m)."
"The net financial result rose year on year, buoyed in 
particular by a much higher return on investment than in 
2022 – in turn chiefly attributable to higher regular interest 
income, a better result from equities and a gain on disposal 
of participations."
"On the whole, the net result for the ERGO International

Analysis of our capital structure 
Our primary insurance and reinsurance operations have a 
significant influence on the structure of our balance sheet."
"In this context, investments serve to cover insurance 
liabilities1 (80% of the balance sheet total)."
"Equity (11% of 
the balance sheet total) and bonds classified as strategic 
debt (2% of the balance sheet total) are the most important 
sources of funds."
"Development of Group equity 
 
 
31122023  
Prev."
"Negative currency translation 
effects, the dividend payment and the share buy-backs 
were offset by a significant margin by the very good net 
result and the increased valuation reserves."
"Strategic debt 
We define as strategic debt all financial instruments with 
the character of outside financing that do not have a direct 
link to our operative business."
"Strategic debt supplements 
our financial resources, is essentially designed to optimise 
the cost of capital, and ensures that we have sufficient 
liquidity at all times."
"We quantify our debt leverage to make 
our capital structure transparent."
"This is defined as the 
ratio – expressed as a percentage – of strategic debt to the 
sum of Group equity, strategic debt and the contractual 
service margin net of tax."
"Our insurance liabilities are not 
considered, even though they are mostly available to us on 
a long-term basis as a source of financing for investment."
"1 
Insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held (net)."
"Debt leverage 
 
  
31122023  
Prev."
"The components of our strategic debt are subordinated 
liabilities, and bonds and notes issued (see the relevant 
sections in the “Notes to the consolidated financial 
statements”)."
"Munich Re’s subordinated liabilities 
amounted to €4,713m (see Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements > Explanatory information > Notes  
to the consolidated balance sheet – Equity and liabilities 
> 25 Subordinated liabilities)."
"Of this sum, €4,610m were 
recognised at the reporting date as eligible own funds 
pursuant to Solvency II."
"Under the supervisory regulations 
of Solvency II, subordinated liabilities are recognised as 
own funds provided that they are available at all times to 
cover losses on a going-concern basis."
"The contractual 
service margin largely represents the gain from a group  
of long-term life and health insurance contracts that has 
not yet been recognised through profit or loss because  
it relates to services to be provided in the future."
"This 
unrealised gain is reported as an insurance liability in  
the balance sheet; we include the CSM (net of tax) when 
calculating our debt leverage."
"Insurance liabilities 
Reinsurance business accounts for approximately 34%  
of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts 
held (net); around 66% comes from primary insurance."
"In 
contrast to liabilities under loans and securities issued, we 
cannot foresee with certainty how high our liabilities from 
underwriting business will be and when they will arise."
This applies especially to reinsurance.
"Whereas in property 
insurance a major portion of the insurance liabilities is 
generally settled within two to three years, in life or third-
party liability insurance substantial amounts may still be 
due decades after the contracts were concluded."
"The 
currency distribution of our insurance contracts issued  
and reinsurance contracts held (net) reflects the global 
orientation of our Group."
"Besides the euro, our main 
currencies are the US dollar, pound sterling, the Canadian 
dollar and the Australian dollar."
"Combined management report

Restraints on disposal 
Since we are an international (re)insurance group, some of 
our financial resources are subject to restraints on disposal."
"Supervisory authorities in some countries, for example, 
require foreign reinsurers to establish premium and reserve 
deposits to the benefit of primary insurers, or set up trustee 
accounts or guarantees with certain financial institutions."
"At the reporting date, restraints on disposal applied to 
investments with a volume of €13bn (11bn)."
"In addition, 
there were contingent liabilities."
"Information on these can 
be found in the Notes to the consolidated financial 
statements > Explanatory information > Other information 
> 62 Contingent liabilities, other financial commitments."
"Capital position 
Optimising our capital structure is one of the main 
objectives of our active capital management system, in 
which we also strive to ensure that Munich Re’s capital 
satisfies all applicable standards."
"In addition to the capital 
requirements determined using our internal risk model, 
more far-reaching requirements by regulatory authorities, 
rating agencies and our key insurance markets must be 
met."
"The Solvency II ratio is a fundamental measure of 
Munich Re’s capital strength."
"Further information on this 
ratio can be found in the Risk report."
"At the same time, we also define an appropriate level of 
Group own funds as one which does not lastingly exceed 
that which is required."
"Excess capital is returned to our 
shareholders via dividends and share buy-backs."
"In practice, 
capital repatriation comes up against limits because, for 
example, the German Commercial Code (HGB) obligates our 
parent, Munich Reinsurance Company, to conduct prudent 
accounting – with regard to the claims equalisation provision, 
for instance."
"This restricts the revenue reserves and profit 
distribution possibilities, but stabilises results in years with 
high claims expenditure."
"Additional information can be 
found under “Munich Reinsurance Company (information 
reported on the basis of German accountancy rules)”."
"Between 2006 and 2023, we returned a total of €36.8bn to 
our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buy-
backs."
"During the reporting year, we bought back shares 
with a total volume of €1,045m, €665m of which as part of 
the €1bn share buy-back programme launched by the 
Board of Management in February 2023."
"This means that 
own shares with a maximum volume of €335m are still to 
be acquired in the period leading up to the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 25 April 2024."
"The rights and 
obligations deriving from these shares follow from the

The listed registered shares are subject to transfer restrictions."
"The issuing of restrictedly transferable registered shares by 
Munich Reinsurance Company dates back to the Company’s 
foundation in 1880."
"Restricted transferability means that 
these shares may be transferred to another holder only with 
the Company’s consent, which, according to Article 3(2) of 
Munich Reinsurance Company’s Articles of Association, is 
granted at the Company’s discretion."
"Since the share-trading 
processes have been made very efficient, the consent 
requirement does not lead to any delays in entry in the register."
"In recent decades, it has been granted without exception."
"Each share carries one vote at the Annual General Meeting 
and determines the shareholders’ participation in the 
Company’s profit."

"On initial 
appointment, members of the Board of Management are 
usually given contracts for a term of three years."
"Extensions 
of up to five years are possible."
"For the appointment  
or dismissal of members of the Board of Management, 
Article 13(3) of the Articles of Association stipulates a two-
thirds majority of the votes cast on the Supervisory Board."
"If the requisite majority is not obtained in the initial 
resolution, the appointment or dismissal of the Board of 
Management requires a simple majority of the votes cast."
"The second resolution is only possible following a suitable 
period of reflection and after the issue has been dealt with 
in the competent committee, but is thereafter also possible 
by written consent in lieu of a meeting."
"In exceptional 
cases, members of the Board of Management may also be 
appointed by a court of law, pursuant to Section 85 of the 
Stock Corporation Act."
"The Stock Corporation Act contains general provisions 
governing amendments to the Articles of Association  
– Section 124(2) sentence 3, and Sections 179–181 of the

"Within a self-determined scope, 
however, the Annual General Meeting can authorise the 
Board of Management to initiate certain (capital) measures."
"The authorisations relating to Munich Reinsurance Company 
are listed below."
"In all such cases, a resolution of the Annual 
General Meeting is required that has been adopted by at 
least a three-quarter majority of the share capital represented 
in the vote."
"Where these resolutions are concerned, the 
Company’s Articles of Association again do not provide for 
other (i.e."
higher) majorities or further requirements.

eliminate the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates and 
changes in the entities consolidated."

"In line with 
our insurance business model, these now include cash flows 
from investment activities that were previously presented 
under cash flows from investing activities."
"The net result was also adjusted by cash outflows of 
€4,915m arising from the expansion of our portfolio of 
financial and non-financial investments, as well as by 
€2,594m for non-cash changes in the fair values of  
assets and liabilities in particular."
"These mostly relate  
to investments."
"Outflows from investing activities were primarily determined 
by those from the acquisition of intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, which amounted to €346m."
"The cash outflows from financing activities stem mainly 
from the dividend payment in 2023 and from share buy-
backs."
"Overall in the year under review, cash – which encompasses 
cash at banks, cheques and cash in hand – fell by €770m 
(including currency effects) to €5,621m."
"There were items 
pledged as security and other restrictions on title amounting 
to €95m (62m)."

Risk governance and risk 
management system 
Risk management organisation 
Organisational structure 
Munich Re set up a governance system that meets Solvency II 
requirements."
"The main elements of this system are the risk 
management, compliance, audit and actuarial functions."
"At 
Group level, risk management is part of the Integrated Risk 
Management division (IRM) and reports to the Group Chief 
Risk Officer (Group CRO)."
"In addition to the Group functions, 
there are risk management units (“mirror functions”) in the 
fields of business."
"Risk governance 
Our risk governance ensures that an appropriate risk  
and control culture is in place by clearly assigning roles  
and responsibilities for all material risks."
"The Board of 
Management must consult the risk management function 
on major decisions to be taken."
"The appropriateness of our 
risk governance is reviewed by the Board of Management 
on a regular basis."
"Defining the risk strategy 
The risk strategy, which is aligned with Munich Re’s 
business strategy, defines where, how and to what extent 
we are prepared to incur risks."
"The further development of 
our risk strategy is embedded in the annual planning cycle, 
and hence in our business planning."
"The risk strategy is 
approved by the Board of Management, and discussed with 
both the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and the 
full Supervisory Board as a material element of the own risk 
and solvency assessment (ORSA) process."
"We determine the risk strategy by defining risk tolerances 
and limits for a number of risk criteria that are based on the 
capital and liquidity available, and on our business strategy, 
and provide a frame of reference for the Group’s operating 
divisions."
"Implementation of strategy and the risk

management of our operations.
"If capacity shortages or 
conflicts with the limit system or regulations arise, defined 
escalation and decision-making processes are followed."
"These have been designed to ensure that the interests of 
the business and risk management considerations are 
weighed and reconciled with each other as far as possible."
"Our implementation of risk management at the operational 
level embraces the identification, analysis and assessment 
of all material risks."
"This provides a basis for risk reporting, 
the control of limits and monitoring."
"Risk identification is performed by means of appropriate 
processes and indicators, which are complemented by 
expert opinions."
"At Munich Re, the early identification of 
risks is primarily operationalised using the emerging risk 
process."
"In this process, new or changing risks are discussed 
with internal and external experts, especially regarding their 
relevance in terms of occurrence probability, expected loss 
amount, and potential impact on Munich Re."
"As part of the risk analysis, a quantitative and qualitative 
assessment of all risks at consolidated Group level is made 
in order to take into account possible interactions between 
risks across all fields of business."
"Internal risk reporting provides the Board of Management 
with regular information on the risk situation, as regards  
the individual risk categories and the entire Group alike."
"This ensures that negative trends are identified in sufficient 
time for countermeasures to be taken."
"The purpose of our 
external risk reporting is to provide clients, shareholders 
and the supervisory authorities with a clear overview of the 
Group’s risk situation."
"Actual risk limits are derived from the risk strategy: taking 
the defined risk appetite as a basis, limits, rules and any 
risk-reducing measures required are approved and 
implemented."
"We also have a comprehensive early-warning 
system that draws our attention to any potential risks."
"The risk management system is regularly audited by Group 
Audit."
"Internal control system1 
Our internal control system is an integrated, Group-wide 
system for managing operational risks."
"Comprising two key 
components – the operational risk control system (ORCS) 
and the compliance management system (CMS) – our 
internal control system addresses both Group management 
requirements and local regulations."
"Combined management report 
91 
Risk report 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Operational risk control system 
The operational risk control system (ORCS) is an essential 
part of the internal control system."
"At Group level, the ORCS 
is overseen by the Integrated Risk Management division 
(IRM), which reports to the Group Chief Risk Officer (Group 
CRO)."
"As part of the ORCS, risk and control self-assessments 
are carried out at least once a year in all fields of business, 
and the material operational risks, including compliance-
related risks, are identified and assessed in the process."
"Key 
controls and management measures to mitigate the material 
operational risks are analysed and assessed."
"In addition, the 
risk management function carries out independent analyses 
and company-wide cross-comparisons regarding operational 
risks and controls (monitoring)."
"Significant control 
deficiencies are addressed by means of improvement 
measures and/or close monitoring."
"The main findings derived 
from the risk and control self-assessments and from 
monitoring are reported to the Board of Management and 
the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"The identification, management and control of risks arising 
out of the accounting process is indispensable for the 
production of reliable annual financial statements at both 
consolidated and solo-undertaking level."
"Risks significant 
for financial reporting from a Group perspective are 
integrated into the internal control system in accordance 
with uniform criteria."
"The risks are checked annually by the 
process owners to ascertain whether they are up to date, and 
the controls are amended as necessary."
"The standardised methodology has been implemented on 
the basis of a Group-wide ORCS policy and guidelines 
specific to the fields of business."
"The 
Group undertakings that have not been integrated into the 
ORCS Group standard control their risks in compliance with 
the principles of good corporate governance, Group-wide 
principles of risk management and relevant national laws."
"No material changes were made to the ORCS in the 
reporting period."
"Compliance management system 
The second key component of the internal control system is 
the compliance management system (CMS)."
"At Group level, 
the Group Compliance & Legal (GCL) division is responsible 
for the CMS, which is managed by the Group Chief 
Compliance Officer (Group CCO)."
"In addition to the Group 
function, there are local compliance functions within the 
fields of business, as well as decentralised compliance 
functions for selected compliance programmes (such as 
Tax Compliance)."
"The Board of Management of Munich 
Reinsurance Company entrusts the development, 
implementation, monitoring and ongoing improvement of

"the Group-wide compliance management system to the 
compliance function."
"The CMS is the methodical 
framework for the structured implementation of early-
warning, risk-control, consulting and monitoring functions 
for compliance risks."
"The CMS is based on an integral compliance culture, an 
established compliance organisation with clearly defined 
roles and responsibilities, and independent, suitable and 
qualified human resources that enable the compliance 
function to work effectively and efficiently."
"In the scope of the CMS, compliance risks are systematically 
identified, analysed and appropriately handled so as to 
minimise the risks."
"This process is based on the foundation 
of the above-mentioned ORCS methodology."
"Process 
results are reported to the Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee."
"No material changes were made to the CMS in the 
reporting period."
"You will find a detailed description of the main features of the 
CMS in the Combined non-financial statement > Compliance."
"In addition, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board 
regularly requests reports on the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the internal control system and on changes to the risk 
and control landscape compared with the previous year."
"The audit reports from Group Audit confirm the general 
effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system."
"In light of the information and reports above – and considering 
the assessments made by experts in the divisions IRM, GCL 
and Group Audit – we consider our risk management systems 
and internal control systems to be generally adequate."
"Significant risks 
Our general definition of risk is possible future developments 
or events that could result in a negative prognosis or a 
negative deviation from the Group’s targets."
"We consider 
three criteria when evaluating the materiality of risks."
"First, 
the extent to which a risk could influence stakeholder 
assessments of Munich Re."
"Second, the ways in which  
a risk could impact the solvency of Munich Re."
"And third, 
the extent to which a risk could exhaust cumulative limits  
or budgets."
"We have applied this definition consistently to 
each business unit and legal entity, taking account of its 
individual risk-bearing capacity."
"The assessment of whether 
a risk is significant or not for a business unit or legal entity 
according to the above definition is performed in the 
responsible risk management functions."
"We make a basic 
distinction between risks included in our internal model and 
covered by risk-based capital and other risks not quantified 
in the internal model."
"The risks included in the internal model 
are divided into the following risk categories: underwriting 
risk in property-casualty business, underwriting risk in life 
and health business, market risk, credit risk and operational 
risk."
"Sustainability risks can affect all of these risk categories 
and are therefore an integral part of the management of 
these risks."
"Risks depicted in the internal model 
Munich Re has a comprehensive internal model that 
determines the capital needed to ensure that the Group  
is able to meet its commitments even after extreme loss 
events."
"We use the model to calculate the capital required 
under Solvency II (the solvency capital requirement, or SCR)."
"The SCR is the amount of eligible own funds that Munich Re 
needs to have available, with a given risk tolerance, to cover 
unexpected losses in the following year."
"It corresponds to 
the value at risk of the economic profit and loss distribution 
over a one-year time horizon with a confidence level of 99.5%, 
and thus equates to the economic loss for Munich Re that, 
given unchanged exposures, will be exceeded each year with 
a statistical probability of 0.5%."
"Our internal model is based 
on specially modelled distributions for the risk categories 
property-casualty, life and health, market, credit and 
operational risks."
"We use primarily historical data for the 
calibration of these distributions, complemented in some 
areas by expert judgement."
"Historical data covers a long 
period to provide a stable and appropriate estimate of our risk 
parameters."
"We continue to take account of diversification 
effects we achieve through our broad spread across various 
risk categories and the combination of primary insurance and 
reinsurance business."
"We also take into account dependencies 
between the risks, which can result in higher capital 
requirements than would be the case if no dependency 
were assumed."
"We then determine the effect of the loss 
absorbency of deferred taxes."
"The table shows the solvency capital requirement for 
Munich Re and its risk categories as at 31 December 2023."

institutions for occupational retirement provision.
"At Group level, the SCR increased by 1.6% to €18.0bn – 
compared with €17.7bn as at 31 December of the previous 
year."
"This increase was mainly driven by extraordinarily 
strong growth in life reinsurance business and a moderate 
expansion of exposure to credit risks in reinsurance 
investments."
"Conversely, a more well-balanced risk profile 
resulted directly in better diversification across risk 
categories, which helped to reduce risk."
"In addition, the SCR 
for property-casualty reinsurance business decreased due to 
an expansion of external retrocession, a more well-balanced 
portfolio structure and the depreciation of the US dollar."
"Other information about the changes in individual risk 
categories and details about risk concentrations can be found 
in the following sections."

"Underwriting risk is defined as the risk of insured losses 
being higher than our expectations."
"The premium and 
reserve risks are significant components of the underwriting 
risk."
"Premium risk is the risk of future claims payments 
relating to insured losses that have not yet occurred being 
higher than expected."
"Reserve risk is the risk of the loss 
provisions established potentially being insufficient to 
cover losses that have already been incurred."
"In measuring 
loss provisions, we follow a cautious reserving approach 
and assess uncertainties conservatively."
"In every quarter, 
we also compare notified losses with our loss expectancy, 
in order to sustain a high level of reserves."
"We differentiate between large losses involving expenditure 
that exceeds a certain large-loss limit; losses affecting more 
than one risk or more than one line of business (accumulation 
losses); and all other losses (basic losses)."
"For basic losses, 
we calculate the risk of subsequent reserving being required 
for existing risks within a year (reserve risk) and the risk of 
under-rating (premium risk)."
"To achieve this, we use 
actuarial methods that are based on standard reserving 
procedures, but take into account the one-year time horizon."
"The calibration for these methodologies is based on our own 
historical loss and run-off data."
"Appropriate homogeneous 
segments of our property-casualty portfolio are used for the 
calculation of the reserve and premium risks."
"To aggregate 
the risk to whole-portfolio level, we apply correlations that 
take account of our own historical loss experience."
"Combined management report 
94

Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Our experts develop scientifically sound models for the 
accumulation scenarios that quantify the probability of 
occurrence and the damage potential."
"The models also take 
risk-limiting elements into consideration, such as cover 
limits."
"In addition to natural catastrophes, we include other 
accumulation risks such as cyber and pandemics, using 
special models."
"Based on these scenarios, the potential effects 
on our portfolio are determined using stochastic models."
"Our internal model considers the resulting accumulation-
risk scenarios to be independent events."
"As part of our regular validation, we look in particular at the 
sensitivity of results produced by the risk model for large 
and accumulation losses to changes in the return periods  
or loss amounts for events, or a change in the business 
volumes written."
"We also consider the effect of changes of 
dependency assumptions on the results."
"We regularly adapt 
our models on the basis of the findings from our validation."
"Another measure for controlling underwriting risks is the 
targeted cession of a portion of our risks to other carriers 
via external reinsurance or retrocession."
"Most of our 
companies have intra-Group and/or external reinsurance 
and/or retrocession cover."
"In addition to traditional retrocession, we use alternative 
risk transfer for natural catastrophe risks in particular."
"Under this process, underwriting risks are transferred to 
the capital markets via special purpose vehicles."
"Solvency capital requirement – Property-casualty 
The solvency capital requirement decreased by around 
3.9% at Group level, mainly owing to expanded external 
retrocession and a more well-balanced portfolio structure 
in reinsurance business."
"The depreciation of the US dollar 
also contributed to the drop in SCR, which was partially 
offset by an update to the basic loss model."

"Of particular relevance are biometric risks 
and policyholder-behaviour risks, such as lapses and lump-

"We differentiate between risks that have a 
short-term or long-term effect on our portfolio."
"In addition 
to the simple risk of random fluctuations resulting in  
higher claims expenditure in a particular year, the adverse 
developments with a short-term impact that we model 
notably include rare – but costly – events such as pandemics."
"To this end, we model losses and the sum at risk – taking 
into particular consideration excess mortalities in 
connection with, for instance, the pandemics of the 20th 
and 21st centuries."
"Further information on the risks in life and health business 
can be found in the Notes to the consolidated financial 
statements > Explanatory information > Disclosures on 
risks from financial instruments and insurance contracts

"Life insurance products in particular, and a large part of our 
health primary insurance business, are long-term in nature, 
and the results they produce are spread over the entire 
duration of the policies."
"This can mean that negative 
developments in risk drivers with long-term effects sustainably 
reduce the value of the insurance portfolio (trend risks)."
"The 
risk drivers mortality and disability are dominated by the life 
and health reinsurance segment, particularly by exposure in 
North America and the Asia-Pacific region."
"We also 
underwrite longevity risk in the life and health reinsurance

Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
segment, especially in the United Kingdom."
"The longevity 
risk driver can additionally be found in the products 
marketed by ERGO in Germany, together with typical risks 
related to policyholder behaviour, such as the lapse risk."
"To 
a lesser extent, we write risks connected with the increase 
in treatment costs."
"Risk modelling attributes probabilities to potential modified 
assumptions."
"We use primarily historical data extracted from 
our underlying portfolios to calibrate these probabilities, and 
additionally apply general mortality rates for the population 
to model the mortality trend risk."
"To enable us to define 
appropriate parameters for the modelling of the range of 
areas in which we operate, portfolios with a homogeneous 
risk structure are grouped together and individual 
comprehensive profit and loss distributions determined."
"We then aggregate these distributions, taking account of 
the dependency structure, to obtain an overall distribution."
"Our largest short-term accumulation risk in the life and 
health risk category is a severe pandemic."
"We counter this 
risk by examining our overall exposure in detail using 
scenario analysis, and by deploying appropriate measures 
to manage the risks."
"In reinsurance, we control the assumption of biometric risks 
by means of a risk-commensurate underwriting policy."
"Interest-rate and other market risks are frequently ruled out 
by depositing the provisions with the cedant, with a 
guaranteed rate of interest from the deposit."
"In individual 
cases, these risks are also hedged by means of suitable 
capital market instruments."
"We also limit our exposure to 
individuals and groups of persons in life insurance."
"For primary insurance, substantial risk minimisation is 
achieved through product design."
"In case of adverse 
developments, parts of the provision for premium refunds – 
which are recognised and reversed in profit or loss – are of 
great significance for risk-balancing."
"In health primary 
insurance, most long-term contracts include the possibility 
and/or obligation to adjust premiums."
"Practically, however, 
there are limits to the resilience of policyholders."
"Limits are laid down for the pandemic scenarios, which 
affect the portfolio in the shorter term, and for the longevity 
scenarios and their longer-term effects in conformity with 
the risk strategy."
"We continue to analyse the sensitivity of 
the internal model to the input parameters on a regular 
basis."
"This relates to the interest rate, the biometric risk 
drivers and customer behaviour."
"Solvency capital requirement – Life and health 
The solvency capital requirement at Group level increased 
significantly by 18%, which was primarily attributable to 
extraordinarily strong growth in reinsurance (especially in 
North America)."

"It includes equity 
risk, general interest-rate risk, specific interest-rate risk, 
property-price risk and currency risk."
"The general interest-
rate risk relates to changes in the basic yield curves, whereas 
the specific interest-rate risk models changes in credit risk 
spreads – for example, on euro government bonds from 
various issuers, or on corporate bonds."
"We also include in  
market risk the risk of changes in inflation rates (depicted  
in the subcategory “general interest-rate risk”) and implicit 
volatilities (cost of options)."
"Fluctuations in market prices 
affect not only our investments, but also the underwriting 
liabilities – especially in life primary insurance."
"Due to the 
long-term interest-rate guarantees given in some cases and 
the variety of options granted to policyholders in traditional 
life insurance, the amount of the liabilities can be highly 
dependent on conditions in the capital markets."

Market risks are modelled by means of Monte Carlo 
simulation of possible future market scenarios."
"We revalue 
our assets and liabilities for each simulated market scenario, 
thus showing the probability distribution for changes to 
basic own funds."
"We use appropriate limit and early-warning systems in our 
asset-liability management to manage market risks."
"Derivatives such as equity futures, options and interest-rate 
swaps – which are predominantly used for hedging 
purposes – also play a role in our management of the  
risks."

"Detailed information on the changes in  
the individual subcategories is available in the following 
sections."
"Equity risk 
The minor increase in the equity risk was due to a rise in 
equity exposure."
"Interest-rate risk 
The general interest-rate risk in the reinsurance field  
of business rose slightly."
"The specific interest-rate risk  
rose on account of higher exposure to fixed-interest 
securities with credit risk exposure, which was attributable, 
among other things, to the restructuring of portfolios and to 
higher market values caused by lower interest rates."
"Combined management report 
97 
Risk report 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
The interest-rate risks in the ERGO field of business were 
down, mainly owing to the restructuring of portfolios and 
more dynamic modelling of volatility adjustments."
"The 
decrease in interest-rate risks was partially offset by lower 
interest rates."
"In the reinsurance field of business, the market value of 
interest-sensitive investments as at 31 December 2023 was 
€74.0bn (70.1bn)."
"Measured in terms of modified duration, 
the interest-rate sensitivity of those investments was 4.7 
(4.8), while that of the liabilities was 4.5 (5.0)."
"A decrease in 
interest rates of one basis point led to a change in available 
own funds amounting to around €9.0m (6.4m)."
"In the ERGO field of business, the market value of interest-
sensitive investments was €109.3bn (105.9bn)."
"The modified 
duration was 7.8 (7.6) for interest-sensitive investments 
and 7.1 (6.9) for liabilities."
"A decrease in interest rates  
of one basis point led to a change in available own funds 
amounting to around €2.4m (6.0m)."
"Property risk 
The property risk decreased slightly, mainly on account of 
lower market values."
"Currency risk 
The currency risk sank slightly due to modified positions in 
foreign currencies."
"Credit risk 
We define credit risk as the financial loss that Munich Re 
could incur as a result of a change in the financial situation 
of a counterparty."
"In addition to credit risks arising out of 
investments in securities and payment transactions with 
clients, we actively assume credit risk through the writing 
of credit and financial reinsurance and in corresponding 
primary insurance business."
"When determining credit risks, Munich Re uses a portfolio 
model that is calibrated over a longer period (at least one 
full credit cycle); it also takes account of changes in fair 
value caused by rating migrations and debtor default."
"The 
credit risk arising out of investments (including government 
bonds and credit default swaps, or CDSs), deposits retained 
on assumed reinsurance and reserves ceded is calculated 
by individual debtor."
"If the credit risk does not exclusively 
depend on the debtor’s creditworthiness, but also on other 
factors (such as subordination, guarantees or collateralisation), 
these are also taken into account."
"We use historical capital 
market data to determine the associated migration and 
default probabilities."
"Correlation effects between debtors 
are derived from the sectors and countries in which they 
operate, and sector and country correlations are based on 
the interdependencies between the relevant stock indices."
"The calculation of the credit risk in “Other receivables” is 
based on internal expert assessments."
"We also capitalise the 
credit risk for highly rated government bonds."
"Information on 
ratings can be found in the Notes to the consolidated financial 
statements > Explanatory information > Disclosures on 
risks from financial instruments and insurance contracts 
> 51 Disclosures on risks from financial instruments."
"Risk concentrations are mainly in government bonds issued 
by countries inside and outside the European Union."
"In 
addition, corporate bonds, pfandbriefs and similar covered 
bonds account for a large proportion of the investments."
"We use a cross-balance-sheet counterparty limit system 
valid throughout the Group to monitor and control our 
Group-wide credit risks."
"The limits for each counterparty  
(a group of companies or country) are based on its financial 
situation as determined by the results of our fundamental 
analyses, ratings and market data, and the risk appetite 
defined by the Board of Management."
"The utilisation of 
limits is calculated on the basis of risk-weighted exposures."
"There are also volume limits for securities lending and 
repurchase transactions."
"Group-wide rules for collateral 
management – for example, for over-the-counter 
derivatives and catastrophe bonds issued – reduce the 
resultant credit risk."
"In monitoring the country risks, we do not simply rely on 
the usual ratings, but perform independent analyses of the 
political, economic and fiscal situation in the countries 
issuing bonds in which Munich Re is most heavily invested."
"In this regard, climate-change-related risks are also 
considered."
"On this basis, and taking account of the 
investment requirements of the fields of business in the 
respective currency areas and countries, limits or specific 
measures are approved."
"These are mandatory throughout the 
Group for investments and the insurance of political risks."
"The sensitivities in the credit risk model are regularly 
checked against the most important input parameters."
"This 
primarily concerns the recovery rates from insolvent debtors, 
the probabilities of debtor migration between rating classes, 
and the parameters for correlations between debtors."
"All validations demonstrated the appropriateness of the 
modelling approaches used."
"We manage credit default risk in retrocession and external 
reinsurance with the assistance of limits determined by the 
Retro Security Committee."
"Combined management report

Risk report 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Solvency capital requirement – Credit 
The solvency capital requirement rose by 32.8% at Group 
level, resulting primarily from a moderate increase in 
investments with credit risk exposure in reinsurance."
"In 
addition, slightly lower interest rates for longer maturities 
led to higher market values of fixed-interest securities."
"Operational risk 
We define operational risk as the risk of losses resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, incidents 
caused by the actions of personnel or system malfunctions, 
or external events."
"This includes criminal acts committed by 
employees or third parties, insider trading, infringements of 
antitrust law, business interruptions, inaccurate processing 
of transactions, non-compliance with reporting obligations, 
and disagreements with business partners."
We use scenario analyses to quantify operational risks.
"The 
results are fed into the modelling of the solvency capital 
requirement for operational risks and are validated using 
various sources of information, such as the ORCS findings 
and both internal and external loss data."
"The sensitivity in the internal model is regularly checked 
against the most important input parameters."
"This mainly 
relates to the dependence of the result on frequency and 
loss amounts and the parameters for the correlations 
between scenarios."
"The analyses showed no anomalies in 
the year under review."
"Solvency capital requirement – Operational risk 
At Group level, the solvency capital requirement for 
operational risks increased slightly by 4.4% owing to 
updated assessments in selected scenarios."
"Security risk 
Security risk is an integral component of operational risk."
"We define security risks as risks resulting from threats to 
the security of our employees, data, information, and 
property."
"We have intensified our monitoring of cyber risks 
in recognition of the increasing importance of information 
technology for Munich Re’s core processes and the dynamic 
environment of cyber crime."
"The Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), a 
function that is assigned to risk management, is responsible 
for the central and Group-wide coordination and control of 
all activities involving information security risks."
"Security risk 
committees have also been set up in the fields of business 
to assess and manage security risks."
"The members of the 
security risk committees are managers from operational 
units (e.g."
"IT Security), the control functions (e.g."
"Risk 
Management, Information Security, and Data Protection), 
and representatives from the divisional units."
"To further improve cyber security, we are working on 
initiatives both specific to and across the fields of business 
to ensure a level of protection in line with our information 
security strategy."
"Further information can be found in the 
Combined non-financial statement > Responsible digital 
transformation, data protection and information security."
"Other risk categories 
As is typical throughout the industry and in accordance with 
regulatory requirements, the risk types specified below are 
not explicitly capitalised in our internal model."
"Qualitative risk 
management is very important for dealing with these risks."
"Reputational risk 
We define reputational risk as the risk of loss that may result 
from a deterioration in the Group’s public image among 
clients, shareholders or other parties."
"Our reputation is 
affected by our behaviour in a number of areas, such as 
client relationships, product quality, corporate governance, 
earnings power, our treatment of employees and corporate 
responsibility."
"Reputational risk is closely intertwined with 
all other risk categories."
"The assessment of individual 
business transactions in terms of their reputational risk is 
performed at field-of-business level by reputational risk 
committees."
"Where a reputational risk could potentially have 
an impact across fields of business, other central divisions 
may be involved in the assessment if required."
"Combined management report 
99 
Risk report 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Strategic risk 
We define strategic risk as the risk of making wrong business 
decisions, implementing decisions poorly, or being unable 
to adapt to changes in the operating environment."
"Existing 
and new potential for success in the Group and the fields  
of business in which it operates creates strategic risks."
"At 
Munich Re, strategic risks are identified, assessed and 
managed in a recurring process comprising a strategic 
dialogue in the Strategy Committee of the Board of 
Management (StratC) and annual planning."
"Furthermore, 
the Group-wide annual (financial) planning process is 
integrated into the strategic dialogue within the StratC."
"This annual planning process includes analysing financial 
sensitivities and risks as well as assessing the capital 
management and risk strategy."
"These process steps are 
mirrored in the primary insurance and reinsurance fields  
of business and in investment management."
"In this way,  
we put our strategy to the test in close dialogue with the 
various stakeholders at different levels (Group, primary 
insurance and reinsurance, asset management)."
"The above 
processes ensure that the Board of Management addresses 
the strategic risks in detail and is well placed to monitor 
and manage them."
"The Group CRO is involved in both the 
strategic and operational business planning as well as in 
significant company sales, mergers and acquisitions."
"Liquidity risk 
Our objective in managing liquidity risk is to ensure that  
we are in a position to meet our payment obligations at all 
times."
"The liquidity risk is managed within the framework of our 
holistic risk strategy, with the Board of Management 
defining limits on which minimum liquidity requirements 
for our operations are based."
"Compliance with minimum 
requirements is continually monitored and regularly 
reported to the Board of Management."
"Using quantitative 
risk criteria, we ensure that Munich Re has sufficient 
liquidity available to meet all its payment obligations even 
under adverse scenarios, with the liquidity position being 
assessed both for extreme insurance scenarios and for 
adverse situations in the capital markets."
"Solvency ratio under Solvency II 
The solvency ratio under Solvency II is the ratio of the 
eligible own funds to the solvency capital requirement."
"Solvency II ratio1 
 
  31122023  
Prev."
"2 
Driven by economic earnings of €56bn, the eligible own funds increased as at 
the reporting date."
"The eligible own funds as at the reporting date take into 
account a deduction for the dividend of €2.0bn agreed  
by the Board of Management and proposed to the Annual 
General Meeting for the 2023 financial year."
"Other risks 
Economic and financial-market developments 
and regulatory risks 
Munich Re is heavily invested in the eurozone, and – in 
reinsurance in particular – in the US dollar currency area,  
a consequence of our global business activities in these 
currency areas."
"We prioritise maintaining a correspondingly 
broad diversification of investments to cover our insurance 
liabilities."
"We take various risk management measures to 
counter fluctuations in the capital markets that can lead to 
volatilities in the Group’s own funds."
"There was moderate growth overall in the global economy 
in 2023."
"However, the eurozone and especially Germany 
stood out negatively, as high inflation, higher interest rates 
and sustained elevated energy prices in particular burdened 
households and manufacturers."
"In the United States, strong 
consumer spending fuelled by a persistently worker-friendly 
job market helped to boost the economy."
"There was also 
more investment in fixed assets – despite higher refinancing 
costs and thanks in part to government assistance as part of 
the Inflation Reduction Act and other programmes."
"Growth 
momentum remained weak in China, where problems in 
the real-estate and shadow-banking sectors still threaten 
to spread."
"Combined management report 
100 
Risk report 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Inflation rates have decreased compared with the previous 
year."
"Despite sustained high forecast uncertainty, we expect 
inflation in the USA and the eurozone to continue easing."
"However, demographic change in Germany is exacerbating 
the shortage of labour and fostering high wage pressure, 
which could in turn contribute to prolonged inflation."
"For Munich Re, above-average inflation rates can have a 
particularly adverse effect on its claims reserves."
"However, we 
believe that expected inflation rates are adequately taken 
into account by applying the standard actuarial methods, 
which address the effects of inflation, and by our conservative 
reserving approach."
"Nevertheless, there is a risk that 
inflation exceeds forecasts and remains high for longer 
than anticipated, in turn impacting the business operations, 
financial position and performance of the Group."
"Although 
Munich Re protects itself against accelerated inflation by 
holding inflation-linked bonds and inflation-linked assets 
such as property, commodities and infrastructure, these 
measures would not be sufficient to fully mitigate the 
repercussions of inflation."
"Conversely, the strong increase in 
interest rates in the eurozone associated with high inflation 
has been a significant relief for life insurance companies 
with guaranteed minimum interest rates."
"Although the 
number of lapses could increase as soon as interest rates 
rise significantly above the guaranteed interest rate, 
Munich Re life insurance companies have not on the whole 
observed such a trend."
"Thus far, both the positive impact 
on earnings capacity and the solvency ratio of life insurance 
companies significantly outweigh the lapse risk."
"In this environment, the general risk of insolvency is also 
elevated and risks could worsen in the real-estate and 
banking sectors."
"Higher interest rates also make refinancing 
more costly for governments and necessitate budgetary 
consolidation."
"Lower real income, reduced discretion for the 
allocation of money, and plans for economic transformation 
can trigger social unrest, more protests, more labour strikes 
and political instability."
"A lack of stability will likely pervade 
upcoming elections, consequently increasing the risk of 
abrupt changes in ruling parties and the risk of political 
deadlock."
"The US general election in November could lead 
to economic policy that is more isolationist and protectionist."
"We regard geopolitical risks in our planning period as very 
relevant."
"In addition to the war in Ukraine, which continues 
to be fought with the same intensity, and the shifts in the 
balance of power, with China as the key player, 2023 was 
marked by a further increase in geopolitical crises."
"These 
included clashes and coups, both attempted and successful, 
in sub-Saharan Africa (Sudan, Niger, Sierra Leone, Gabon, 
Burkina Faso), Azerbaijan’s seizure of Nagorno-Karabach, 
the tensions on the Kosovo-Serbian border and, first and 
foremost, Hamas’ attack on Israel."
"Munich Re is observing 
the developments closely and is analysing the risks in regions 
where it has substantial exposures."
"We have conducted detailed analyses of potential losses in 
various war scenarios (particularly China/Taiwan, Russia 
and the Baltic states, and a nuclear escalation of the war 
between Russia and Ukraine), with a focus on direct war 
cover."
"We regard any potential indirect consequential losses 
or collateral damage or implications for capital markets as 
extremely dependent on a given assumption."
"Our analyses 
indicate that the direct exposures are manageable and do 
not necessitate any modifications to our risk strategy."
"Although the indirect consequences – particularly capital 
market upheavals – could be material and exceed the direct 
losses, they are subject to considerable uncertainty, which 
severely restricts the scope for taking preventive measures 
or recommending courses of action."
"Global players such as Munich Re are subject to increased 
fiscal pressure nationally and internationally, as well as a 
higher audit intensity."
"Given the current political emphasis 
on an appropriate taxation of international companies and 
the introduction of a global minimum tax rate, which has 
applied in the EU since 1 January 2024, this trend will continue 
and intensify."
"Climate change 
Climate change is an emerging risk that represents the 
central sustainability risk in relation to the environment."
"Climate-related risks arise in the form of physical and 
transition risks, with interdependencies between both risk 
types."
"Physical risks arise from the increasing frequency 
and severity of extreme weather events (hurricanes, 
wildfires, severe convective storms, floods, etc.) and chronic 
changes such as sea level rise."
"Transition risks arise 
particularly as a consequence of political or economic 
measures to shift to a low-carbon economy or reactions  
to changing living conditions in certain regions."
"Both types 
of risks involve medium-term and long-term effects, but 
can also have disruptive, short-term consequences."
"Any 
assessment of how these risks will impact Munich Re’s 
exposures in the long term is subject to a high degree of 
uncertainty."
"This is because the transition path and the way 
it affects other emerging risks are uncertain, as are the 
resulting impacts on known risk drivers such as premium 
and reserve risks or the impact of changes in share prices, 
interest rates or exchange rates on investments."
"We are 
therefore working intensively on the impact of climate change 
on our Group."
"Consequently, we have performed cross-
balance sheet scenario analyses in order to estimate how 
resilient the company is in the event of various climate change 
scenarios and in order to devise specific actions to be taken."
"On the basis of these scenario analyses, we more closely 
assessed potential risks arising from climate suits (lawsuits 
in connection with climate change)."
"In the process, potential 
exposures to litigation risk in our insurance portfolio were 
identified as a material risk."
"To counter this risk, we have  
 
 
Combined management report 
101 
Risk report 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
issued/updated a range of topic papers and best practices 
that provide underwriters with standard clauses and update 
them on developments in case law."
"Respective training is also 
offered."
"Furthermore, the new product process criteria were 
expanded to include ESG aspects such as greenwashing risk."
"We do not see any material additional risk in property 
insurance arising from climate change."
"This is due to our 
ability to regularly adapt risk and natural-hazard models  
to take the effects of climate change into appropriate 
consideration."
"For the majority of our underwriting portfolio, 
the annual renewals process provides the opportunity  
to react at short notice to negative developments and 
negotiate premium adjustments and/or new contractual 
terms such as limits."
"Further information – in particular  
on the probable maximum loss (PML) to our insurance 
portfolio from climate-related natural catastrophes for  
a 200-year return period – is available in the Combined 
non-financial statement > Insurance activities."
"In the long term, however, a material strategic risk could 
arise."
"For example, at some point the risk-commensurate 
prices for insurance products could exceed what customers 
are willing to pay, which would make insuring against certain 
types of risk unaffordable for customers or unfeasible  
for insurers (financial limits of insurability)."
"Munich Re 
counters this risk by generally ensuring that its risk strategy 
includes a diversified insurance portfolio."
"In the life and health reinsurance segment, we have analysed 
the potential effects of climate change on the mortality and 
health of insureds in our portfolios."
"Climate change scenarios 
relate to much longer periods than our usual scenarios for 
potential trend risks."
"Reliable quantitative information is 
only available to a limited extent and depends heavily on  
a variety of potential climate change pathways."
"The effects 
are dependent on climate forecasts and a population’s 
demographic and geographic composition."
"Older people and 
socio-economically disadvantaged groups are at greatest 
risk."
"It is very difficult to identify deaths in which climate 
was a contributing factor."
"Furthermore, the insured 
population may be less severely impacted by the effects of 
climate change than the overall population."
"Our analyses 
indicate that the two greatest potential physical risks for 
life and health insurance are extreme heat events in the 
United States and Asia as well as the unabated increase in 
average temperatures, which may ultimately lead to more  
frequent epidemics/pandemics."
"Although the quantitative 
information on these topics is subject to considerable 
uncertainty, we do not currently anticipate climate change 
to have any material effects on our exposures."
"With reference to our investments, we see a relevant risk in 
illiquid investments with long maturities."
"The due diligence 
process for alternative investments therefore includes 
analysing potential location-specific threats due to climate 
change."
"In addition, we continually monitor and limit the 
concentration and liquidity risks affecting our investments."
"We therefore consider the impacts of climate change on our 
investments not to be a material risk overall."
"Legal risks 
As part of the normal course of business, Munich Re 
companies are involved in court, regulatory and arbitration 
proceedings in various countries."
"The outcome of those or 
possibly imminent proceedings is neither certain nor 
predictable."
"However, we believe that none of these 
proceedings will have a significant negative effect on the 
financial position of Munich Re."
"Such proceedings are  
dealt with using combined expertise within the individual 
departments and units."
"Assessment of the risk situation 
In accordance with the prescribed processes, our Board 
committees explicitly defined the risk appetite for significant 
risk categories in the year under review, and quantified it 
with key figures."
"We determined and documented the risk 
appetite across the Group hierarchy and communicated it 
throughout the Group."
"In 2023 risk exposures were regularly 
quantified and compared with the risk appetite."
"They were 
reported on and discussed in the relevant committees."
"At 267%, the Solvency II ratio is at a very comfortable level 
above our communicated optimal range of 175–220% 
(without application of transitional measures)."
"Munich Re 
thus continues to have a very solid capital base."
"Based on 
up-to-date findings and on our internal model, Munich Re’s 
Solvency II ratio (without application of transitional 
measures) would be at least within or above the optimal 
range even in the event of major loss events and negative 
capital market effects."
"We therefore assess Munich Re’s 
risk situation to be manageable and under control."
"In the pricing of risks assumed in the motor, fire and other 
property insurance, and marine lines of business, and also 
in sections of engineering reinsurance and ERGO, there  
is a high degree of sensitivity regarding the underlying 
assumptions about natural catastrophes."
"The following 
table therefore shows the combined ratios for property-
casualty reinsurance, including and excluding natural 
catastrophe losses."
"1 
In accordance with German Accounting Standard No."
"2 
Further information on the combined ratio can be found under “Tools  
of corporate management and strategic financial objectives”, and in the

Risk report 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Major losses, by which we mean individual losses 
exceeding €30m, are particularly relevant in property-
casualty reinsurance."
"The provision for outstanding claims is subject to a reserve 
risk, i.e."
"the risk that actual claims settlement may be less 
than or exceed the amount reserved."
"Information on the 
development of claims and claims payments over time can be 
found in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
> Explanatory information > Notes to the consolidated balance 
sheet – Equity and liabilities > 28 Liability for incurred 
claims."
"A particular sensitivity to reserve risks exists in the 
case of contracts with long run-off periods."
"This characteristic 
applies especially to third-party liability insurance, where 
liabilities may manifest themselves after a considerable 
latency period."
"1 
The figure for the previous year was based on IFRS 4."
"Risks from defaults on receivables from

"Of all our receivables on underwriting business at the 
reporting date, €644m (646m)1 were outstanding for more 
than 90 days."
"The receivables on underwriting business are 
included in the carrying amounts of insurance contracts 
issued and reinsurance contracts held."
"The average default 
rate for the last three years was 1.1% (1.4%)1."
"In addition, this section includes 
information on liquidity risk in connection with maturity 
date analyses of contractual net cash flows and amounts 
payable on demand."
"Unless stated 
otherwise, the opportunities for Munich Re outlined below 
generally relate equally to all fields of business."
"Business environment 
We assume that global economic growth will be sluggish  
in 2024."
"Tight monetary policy, high price levels and 
geopolitical uncertainty will likely continue to impede 
economic growth."
"Although we expect inflation to ease 
further, we also anticipate that average annual inflation  
in many countries will again considerably exceed the 
targets of key central banks in 2024."
"Our high degree  
of diversification and our strong capitalisation mitigate  
the risks we face, and will open up additional business 
opportunities for us provided the macroeconomic 
parameters that are especially relevant to us improve."
"Stronger economic growth – in combination with more 
rapidly decreasing inflation rates – tends to have a positive 
impact on the demand for insurance cover and triggers 
higher premium volume in most classes of insurance."
"In 
addition, the coronavirus pandemic has caused many 
reinsurance and primary insurance clients to recognise that 
they need increased risk protection."
"The need for first-class 
medical care and cover against unforeseeable risks was 
brought home to consumers, which could have a positive 
effect on demand for insurance products, particularly 
private health insurance."
"Economic dynamics, which are expected to be positive in 
the long term, and the low degree of insurance penetration  
in many developing and emerging markets represent 
opportunities for profitable expansion and further 
diversification of our business portfolio along the entire 
value chain."
"One example of that is the targeted growth  
in reinsurance through service provision for cedants in 
emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East and South 
America."
"Against the backdrop of higher inflation and moderately 
increasing global reinsurance capacity in 2023, we expect 
prices to remain stable in international property insurance, 
with numerous opportunities for profitable growth – especially 
in our reinsurance and industrial insurance portfolios."
"Digital transformation 
Digitalisation is increasingly transforming the markets, and 
the continuous changes in customer behaviour are demanding 
greater flexibility in terms of providing access, coverage and 
solutions, as well as in our underlying internal structures."
"Driving digital transformation therefore remains one of 
Munich Re’s strategic priorities and is part of our Group 
Ambition 2025."
"We are continually adjusting our internal structures and 
processes to reduce complexity and costs, while at the same 
time seizing the opportunities that digital transformation 
offers."
"We are attempting to automate as much as possible, 
along the entire value chain and across all units."
"We want 
to deliver what our clients and we ourselves expect in terms 
of quality, speed and security, while continuing to increase 
efficiency."
"This applies not just to traditionally client-
focused areas such as sales, contract administration and 
claims handling, but also for example to the digitalisation  
of our asset management."
"In addition, we are leveraging 
opportunities arising from flexible, mobile working models 
to retain and attract qualified staff."
"We are also taking account of increasing demand for digital 
products in our research and development activities."
"At 
ERGO, for example, we heavily invest in the development of 
new technologies, such as traditional and generative AI, the 
metaverse, robotics and virtual assistants."
"In doing so, we 
intend to make our processes and operations more efficient 
and intelligent, thus enhancing customer experience."
"The above-mentioned technologies, particularly traditional 
and generative AI, play a similarly key role in reinsurance."
"The primary focus here is on new opportunities in business 
management, such as providing a greater range of 
information to underwriters for faster, better decision-making 
(“augmented underwriting”)."
"We are also leveraging our 
many years of experience with traditional and generative AI 
to help our clients overcome challenges associated with the 
implementation of augmented underwriting, the success of 
which can be facilitated by our AI-based solutions."
"We are fostering the development of innovative products 
and services by means of our digital infrastructure, our 
corporate venture capital (CVC) activities and many initiatives 
of relevance to our lines of business."
"Doing so helps us to 
safeguard our business model in the long term and, 
whenever necessary and promising, to expand our model so 
as to tap growth opportunities in the digital world."
"Given 
our clients’ hybrid requirements, we are actively driving the 
integration of various products and sales channels, and the 
expansion of direct sales in all classes of primary insurance."
"MEAG is also playing a key role in 
this respect with its investment expertise."
"Moreover, 
advances in medicine and the increasing significance of 
prevention in primary insurance are providing us with a 
host of possibilities for satisfying our clients’ most diverse 
needs and binding them to Munich Re, as well as for 
expanding our business."
"In life reinsurance, we also offer 
integrated reinsurance and financing solutions."
"Ecologically and socially sustainable action is becoming 
more and more important for the insurance industry."
"Our 
many different activities in this context and our high and 
reliable ESG standards give us the opportunity to be 
perceived as an attractive partner for investors, clients and 
staff, and to address societal expectations."
"Further information 
is available in the Combined non-financial statement."
"Climate change and natural 
catastrophes 
We expect climate change to lead to an increase in weather-
related natural catastrophes in the long term – despite the 
global efforts being made."
"This growing loss potential will 
result in greater demand for primary insurance and 
reinsurance products."
"We see considerable business potential in the transition to 
a climate-neutral economy."
"We anticipate a sharp increase 
in investment in renewable energy in an effort to meet the 
net-zero goal by 2050."
"We possess leading engineering 
and risk assessment expertise and we have innovative risk-
transfer concepts ready for this investment surge."
"This 
relates to many significant renewable energy areas such as 
electricity generation (solar, wind, hydroelectric, etc.), 
transmission and storage (battery storage, pumped storage 
and hydrogen)."
"Expanding the limits of insurability 
Together with our clients, we strive to expand the 
boundaries of insurability in many ways and provide our 
customers with new and enhanced types of cover."
"For 
example, in cyber insurance we are offering our clients 
diverse coverage concepts for risks and damage caused  
by faulty product software and cyber attacks, as well as 
services ranging from preventative measures to the 
recovery of lost data."

Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
 
Prospects 
This section contains forward-looking statements that  
are based on current assumptions and forecasts of the 
management of Munich Re."
"We do not accept any 
responsibility or liability in the event that they are not 
realised in part or in full."
"As always, the projections are 
subject to major losses remaining within normal bounds, 
and to the income statement not being impacted by severe 
fluctuations in the currency or capital markets, significant 
changes in the tax environment, or other one-off effects."
"Munich Re 
We estimate that the Group’s insurance revenue from 
insurance contracts issued (insurance revenue) in 2024 will 
total around €59bn, up slightly on 2023."
"In addition, we expect our annual return on investment to 
surpass 2.8% – a considerable year-on-year increase."
"Our target net result for 2024 is around €5.0bn, substantially 
higher than the 2023 net result."
"The forecasts are subject 
to major losses being within normal bounds and liability for 
incurred claims remaining unchanged."
"Furthermore, they 
are dependent on our income statement not being impacted 
by severe currency or capital market movements, significant 
changes in fiscal parameters, or other special factors."
"For 2024, we expect our economic earnings to surpass  
the IFRS net result of €5.0bn."
"The compilation of financial 
reports in accordance with IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 has 
increased harmonisation between the IFRS net result and 
economic earnings as performance indicators – but 
differences remain nevertheless."
"Of particular note are the 
differences pertaining to both the timing of the recognition 
of profit and the impact of capital market effects."
"The 
projection for the economic earnings is based on the 
assumption of stable conditions and capital markets, 
unchanged modelling parameters, and normal major-loss 
incidence."
"Deviations from these assumptions may have a 
different impact on economic earnings than on IFRS 
accounting."
"Further information on economic earnings as  
a management tool can be found under “Tools of corporate 
management and strategic financial objectives”."
"Subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting, the 
dividend will amount to €15.00 per share."
"This is equivalent 
to a total payout of €2.0bn."
"Reinsurance 
In the reinsurance field of business, we expect insurance 
revenue of around €39bn for 2024, up marginally on 
2023’s figure."
"Currency translation effects could potentially 
have a considerable impact on this estimate."
"The net result 
for the reinsurance field of business is expected to total 
around €4.2bn."
"We project a total technical result of around €1.45bn for  
life and health reinsurance."
"The total technical result 
comprises the insurance service result and the result from 
insurance-related financial instruments."
"We anticipate the combined ratio in property-casualty 
reinsurance to be about 82% based on net insurance revenue."
"Price development was stable overall, and for the most part 
more than compensated for the higher loss estimates in 
some areas, which were caused primarily by inflation or 
other loss trends."
"Primary insurance prices also increased in 
many markets."
"Overall, the high price level for Munich Re’s 
portfolio was maintained with a 0.3% increase."
"Higher 
interest rates had a positive effect on economic profitability."
"As at 1 January 2024, around two-thirds of non-life 
reinsurance treaty business was up for renewal, with a focus 
on Europe, the USA, and global business, and representing 
a premium volume of €15.2bn."
"Total premium volume 
written increased by 3.5% to around €15.7bn."
"Thanks to our 
strong client relationships and our sought-after expertise, 
we were able to tap into attractive business opportunities  
 
 
Combined management report 
107 
Prospects 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
across all regions and classes of business."
"These involved 
the expansion of existing client relationships as well as new 
business."
"At the same time, we were willing to discontinue 
business that did not meet our expectations with regard to 
prices or terms and conditions."
"The renewals as at 1 April 2024 (above all in Japan and 
India) and 1 July 2024 (parts of the portfolio in the USA, 
Australia and Latin America) will involve the renegotiation 
of a premium volume of around €6.5bn in reinsurance 
treaty business."
"It is Munich Re’s expectation that the 
recent price increases and improved treaty conditions will 
be upheld in these renewal rounds, too."
"ERGO 
In the ERGO field of business, we expect stable insurance 
revenue of around €20bn for 2024."
"The net result for 2024, 
at around €0.8bn, should be substantially higher than that 
for 2023."
"We aim to achieve a combined ratio of around 87% in the 
ERGO Property-casualty Germany segment, and around 
90% in the ERGO International segment."
"Both forecasts are 
based on the assumption that major losses are at a normal 
level."
"Just as in property-casualty reinsurance, the ERGO 
combined ratios are based on net insurance revenue."
"Supplementary to our Munich Re reporting, this section 
provides details on the performance of Munich Reinsurance 
Company."
"The annual financial statements of Munich Reinsurance 
Company are prepared in accordance with German 
accounting rules (HGB)."
"By contrast, the consolidated 
financial statements are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)."
"As a 
result, there are some deviations in the accounting policies 
– mainly with regard to intangible assets, investments, 
financial instruments, individual underwriting assets and 
liabilities, and deferred taxes."
"Market environment and major 
factors of influence 
The macroeconomic and industry environment of Munich 
Reinsurance Company essentially corresponds to that of 
the Group."
"Please see the section “Macroeconomic and 
industry environment” for more detailed information."
"Business performance 
In the 2023 financial year, Munich Reinsurance Company’s 
business performance was once again pleasing overall."
"Major-loss expenditure was lower than in the previous year, 
although it was impacted by significant losses resulting 
from the devastating earthquake in Turkey in February."
"While natural catastrophe losses were higher in the reporting 
year, man-made major losses were down considerably."
"Growth of profitable business likewise contributed to the 
positive net result."
"Conversely, the reserve releases made for prior accident 
years following a review of our reserving position were 
down on the previous year."
"The underwriting result before 
claims equalisation provision decreased overall."
"The accounting result of Munich Reinsurance Company 
developed as follows: 
 
Condensed income statement for Munich Reinsurance Company 
 
 
2023  
Prev."
"The year-on-year increase of 1.5% chiefly resulted from 
new business and growth of existing business."
"Changes  
in the value of the euro as against other currencies had a 
dampening effect."
"Gross premium volume in life and health reinsurance was 
down in the reporting year, with gross premiums falling by 
7.1% to €8,254m (8,885m)."
"If exchange rates had remained 
unchanged, our premium income in life and health reinsurance 
would have decreased by 2.9%."
"In property-casualty reinsurance, on the other hand,  
we posted growth in gross premium income of 4.9% to 
€23,764m (22,665m) in the reporting year."
"The increase 
was due to new business and business growth across a 
large number of lines and regions."
"If exchange rates had 
remained the same, premium volume would have been  
up by 8.4%."
"In the reinsurance renewals, Munich Re managed to exploit 
growth opportunities, particularly in the area of non-
proportional natural catastrophe covers owing to the 
attractive price level."
"Prices, terms and conditions improved 
overall in the sectional markets, with considerably different 
trends dependent upon claims experience, future claims 
expectations and the situation in each individual market."
"Prices rose – considerably in some instances – for insurance 
cover in regions and classes of business with high loss 
experience."
"By contrast, prices rose only slightly in regions 
and classes of business with low claims experience."
"Munich Re takes the different price trends into account  
and has deliberately withdrawn from business that no 
longer met risk-return expectations."
"All in all, prices for  
the Munich Re portfolio increased by around 3.1%."
"Overall,  
we adhered to our profit-oriented underwriting policy."
"At €1,459m, the underwriting result before claims 
equalisation provision was slightly less than in 2022 during 
the reporting year."
"This reduction resulted primarily from  
a lower release of provisions for claims from prior years as 
part of our customary review of provisions for the full year."
"Over the years, the safety margin in the provisions has 
remained unchanged at a high level."
"By contrast, major-
loss expenditure was lower overall than in the previous 
year, which had seen a much greater impact from natural 
catastrophe losses."
"Major-loss expenditure totalling €2,724m after retrocession 
and before tax was lower year on year, and slightly below 
the expected value of 14%."
"There were again many major 
losses in the 2023 financial year."
"With expected losses of 
around €550m, the year’s biggest loss event by far was the 
devastating earthquake in Turkey."
"Due to various other major loss events – such as Hurricane 
Otis, which tore through Mexico in October 2023 – natural 
catastrophe losses totalled €1,973m, up on the previous 
year."
"In terms of net earned premium, aggregate natural 
catastrophe losses accounted for 9.8 percentage points of 
the loss ratio."
"Man-made major losses in the reporting year totalled 
€750m in property-casualty reinsurance, down considerably 
on the previous year."
"This was equivalent to 3.7 percentage 
points of net earned premium."
"The combined ratio, which reflects the relation of claims 
and costs to net earned premiums, came to 96.4% (93.7%) 
overall, mainly owing to the above effects."

"The

to higher claims expenditure."
"Non-technical result 
Global economic growth weakened slightly in 2023, owing 
mainly to high inflation and restrictive monetary policy."
"Economic momentum waned considerably, particularly in 
Europe."
"By contrast, the US economy remained surprisingly 
strong and China’s economy grew faster year on year 
following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions."
"Rates of 
inflation fell thanks to lower energy prices, but average 
inflation rates for the year were still significantly above the 
long-term average in many countries."
"In response to persistently high inflation, key central banks 
further tightened monetary policy in 2023."
"Yields on ten-year government bonds in the United States 
and Germany reached their highest levels in years in 2023."
"Growing expectations that central banks would soon cut 
rates, however, contributed to a drop in yields in Q4."
"By  
the end of December, yields on US bonds had returned to 
approximately the same level as at the beginning of the 
year, while those on German bonds were down slightly."
"In the reporting year, international financial markets were 
generally less volatile than in the previous year."
"Important 
equity indices rose significantly in 2023, including the  
US Dow Jones Industrial Average and the EURO STOXX 50."
"On the currency markets, fluctuations were also less 
pronounced in 2023 than in the previous year."
"At the end  
of December, the US dollar and Canadian dollar were 
somewhat lower against the euro."
"The pound sterling was

"The annual average values against the

above-mentioned currencies."
"In the 2023 financial year, Munich Reinsurance Company’s

"We were also 
able to generate higher regular income in the reporting year."
"Profit for the year 
Munich Reinsurance Company generated a profit of €3,941m 
(1,095m) in the 2023 financial year, up significantly in a year-
on-year comparison thanks not only to the encouraging 
business performance but also, and in particular, to an above-
average investment result."
"The increase in tax expenses compared to the previous year

Pursuant to German commercial and company law,

profits and revenue reserves."
"Besides the expenses and 
income incurred in the current year, changes in the claims 
equalisation provision also have a significant influence on 
the level of profits for the year."
"The claims equalisation provision is established for individual 
classes of property-casualty business."
"It serves to smooth 
significant fluctuations in loss experience over a number of 
years."
"Its recognition and measurement are governed by 
legal provisions."
"If, in a given financial year, loss ratios in individual classes 
of business are significantly in excess of the long-term 
average (which amounts to 15 years in most classes), the 
claims equalisation provision is reduced and the above-
average loss expenditure is largely offset."
"According to 
current calculations, it is expected that – given normal 
claims expenditure in the 2024 financial year – the amounts 
allocated will be moderate."
"The 
performance-related change in the claims equalisation 
provision is added to this figure in years in which claims 
experience is favourable (i.e."
"when the random occurrence 
of claims is below average), whereas amounts are 
withdrawn in years in which claims experience is adverse 
(i.e."
the random occurrence of claims is above average).
"The balance sheet item “Claims equalisation provision and 
similar provisions” decreased by €252m to €8,060m (8,313m) 
in the 2023 financial year."
"Owing to positive results, we had 
to allocate significant amounts to the claims equalisation 
provision in some classes of business – especially in fire 
€338m (−462m), credit €197m (221m), and marine €25m 
(−189m)."
"Due to negative results, the claims equalisation provision 
was reduced in the following classes of business: motor 
−€270m (−234m), third-party liability −€237m (381m), and 
aviation −€46m (44m)."
"In addition, owing to a reduction of the maximum amount, 
the claims equalisation provision in personal accident 
reinsurance was adjusted by −€284m (−35m)."
"As we ceased preparing separate profit and loss accounts 
in engineering and “Other classes” in the 2021 reporting 
year, we have no longer set a claims equalisation provision 
for these classes of business since then."
"The current level of the claims equalisation provision is 
100% of the legally stipulated maximum amount allowed in 
the personal accident class of business, and more than 50% 
in third-party liability, motor and credit."
"Liquidity 
Our liquidity is ensured at all times by means of detailed 
liquidity planning."
"As a rule, the Company generates 
significant liquidity from its premium income, from regular 
investment income and from investments that mature."
"We also attach great importance to the credit rating and 
fungibility of our investments."
"Given the maturity structure 
of the outstanding bonds and the credit facilities employed 
(which are, in any case, relatively insignificant in scope), 
there are no refinancing requirements."
"The statements have been 
combined and can be found in the “Corporate governance” 
section."
"Pursuant to Section 317(2) sentence 6 of the

The projections by Munich Reinsurance Company about 
the future development of its business are essentially 
subject to the same influences as the reinsurance life and 
health and reinsurance property-casualty segments 
presented in the consolidated financial statements."
"You  
can find this information in “Outlook 2024”."
"Against this background, Munich Reinsurance Company 
should post gross premium of around €33bn in the 2024 
financial year – assuming that exchange rates remain 
constant."
"We expect the combined ratio to be at around the  
same level as in the reporting year."
"An accurate forecast is 
not possible, partly due to the obvious fluctuations in the 
incidence of major losses."
"Assuming average claims 
experience, we project that the underwriting result before 
claims equalisation provision for the 2024 financial year 
will be slightly higher than in the reporting year."
"The investment result of Munich Reinsurance Company is 
expected to once again show positive development in the 
2024 financial year."
"While we expect to report lower gains 
on disposals, we predict much higher income from 
affiliated companies in the year ahead."
"All in all, as things stand at present, we expect to achieve  
a German GAAP (HGB) result in 2024 that is likely to be 
even higher than the already substantial result achieved in 
the reporting year."

modalities for the adoption of resolutions."
"The Audit 
Committee also has its own rules of procedure, which have 
been adopted by the full Supervisory Board."
"The rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board and for 
the Audit Committee are available on the Munich Re 
website at www.munichre.com/supervisory-board."
"The Supervisory Board normally meets at least six times 
during the financial year."
"Supervisory Board meetings are 
generally held with the members of the Supervisory Board 
personally present at the meeting (face-to-face meeting)."
"If 
the Chair of the Supervisory Board so rules, meetings of the 
Supervisory Board may also be held using electronic media, 
and individual members of the Supervisory Board may attend 
meetings via electronic media."
"The members of the Board 
of Management attend the meetings of the Supervisory 
Board unless the Chair of the Supervisory Board decides 
otherwise."
"If the external auditor is consulted as an expert 
appraiser, the Board of Management does not attend this 
meeting unless the Supervisory Board considers the Board 
of Management’s attendance to be necessary."
"The 
Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Board 
of Management."
"The Supervisory Board is quorate if all its members have 
been invited to the meeting or called upon to vote, and if 
fifteen members – or ten members including the Chair – 
participate in the vote."
"In the event of  
a Supervisory Board vote being tied, should a second vote 
on the same motion also result in a tie, the Chair of the 
Supervisory Board has a casting vote."
"The Chair is 
authorised to make declarations for the Supervisory Board 
based on resolutions."
"Self-assessment 
The Supervisory Board and its committees regularly assess 
how effectively the Supervisory Board as a whole and also 
its individual committees perform their duties."
"Following 
preparations by the Praesidium and Sustainability Committee 
in 2023, the Supervisory Board conducted an internal self-
assessment based on a questionnaire."
"The Supervisory Board 
thoroughly discussed the findings of the self-assessment  
at its meeting on 26 October 2023."
"The self-assessment 
confirmed that the working relationships within the 
Supervisory Board and with the Board of Management  
are professional and constructive, and characterised by a 
high degree of trust and candour."
"In addition, the findings 
documented the efficient organisation and execution of 
meetings, as well as appropriate reporting by the Board of 
Management."
"There was no indication of any fundamental 
need for change."
"A few optimisation measures were identified 
and are being put into practice."
"The committees adopt decisions by the majority of votes 
cast."
"With the exception of the Conference Committee, the 
chair of the committee has a casting vote in case of a tie."
"The full Supervisory Board is regularly informed about the 
work of the committees by their respective chairs."

"Further details of the work of the Supervisory Board 
committees can be found in the report of the Supervisory 
Board and at www.munichre.com/supervisory-board."
"The main responsibilities of the committees are as follows: 
Praesidium and Sustainability Committee 
The Praesidium and Sustainability Committee prepares 
meetings of the Supervisory Board, unless another committee 
is responsible for doing so."
"It decides on matters of Company 
business requiring the Supervisory Board’s consent, unless 
the full Supervisory Board or another committee is 
responsible."
"In addition, the Praesidium and Sustainability 
Committee is responsible for an internal procedure – as per 
Section 111a(2) of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG) – that 
assesses related-party transactions."
"The Committee regularly 
deals with sustainability issues (ESG), except in cases 
where other committees are responsible."
"Moreover, the 
Praesidium and Sustainability Committee prepares the annual 
self-assessment of the effectiveness of the Supervisory 
Board as a whole and its individual committees with regard 
to the performance of their duties."
"Further details about  
the self-assessment in the past financial year are provided 
in the section “Self-assessment” and in the Report of the 
Supervisory Board."
"Personnel Committee 
The Personnel Committee prepares the appointment of 
members to the Board of Management."
"It also prepares the 
long-term succession planning together with the Board of 
Management, including setting targets for the number of 
women on the Board of Management."
"This Committee approves loan 
transactions between the Company and members of the 
Board of Management and their related parties."
"The Personnel 
Committee also decides whether to approve sideline activities 
of members of the Board of Management, particularly 
mandates on supervisory boards or similar committees."
"The Personnel Committee may be involved in this 
assessment."
"Where sustainability (ESG) issues are 
concerned, the Praesidium and Sustainability Committee 
may be involved in determining and assessing the 
performance criteria and objectives for variable remuneration."
"Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee prepares Supervisory Board 
resolutions on the adoption of the Company’s annual 
financial statements and approval of the consolidated 
financial statements."
"It discusses the Half-Year Financial 
Report and the material information underlying the 
quarterly statements, and receives the audit reports, other 
reports and statements by the external auditor."
"The Audit 
Committee also discusses the essential components of the 
Solvency II reporting with the Board of Management."
"This Committee monitors accounting and the financial 
reporting process."
"It also monitors the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the risk management system, the internal 
control system, the compliance management system and 
handling of material compliance cases, the actuarial function 
system and the internal audit system."
"Furthermore, the 
Audit Committee is responsible for examining potential 
claims for breach of duty against members of the Board of 
Management."
"The Audit Committee prepares the procedure for selecting 
the external auditor, in particular the Supervisory Board’s 
proposal to the Annual General Meeting."
"The Audit 
Committee is responsible for assessing performance and 
monitoring the independence of the external auditor; it also 
monitors and assesses the quality of the audit and any 
additional services provided by the external auditor."
"In 
particular, it hires the external auditor for the Company and 
Group financial statements as well as for any voluntary 
external audit of the combined non-financial statement."
"The 
Audit Committee also defines focal points of the audits and 
agrees the auditor’s fee for the annual audits; the same applies 
to the review of the Half-Year Financial Report and the review 
of the solvency balance sheets."
"Beyond this, the Committee 
handles the approval and monitoring of non-audit services."
"In this connection, the Audit Committee hears reports not 
only from the Board of Management but also directly from 
the General Counsel & Group Chief Compliance Officer, 
the Group Chief Auditor, the Group Chief Risk Officer, and 
the Head of the Actuarial Function."
"Through 
its Chair, the Audit Committee maintains a regular dialogue 
with the auditor also in between meetings."
"The Chair of the 
Audit Committee regularly discusses the progress of the 
audit with the auditor and reports thereon to the Audit 
Committee."
"The Audit Committee consults with the auditor 
on a regular basis without the Board of Management."
"Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee is made up exclusively of 
shareholder representatives."
"As a basis for this, 
the shareholder representatives have developed and adopted 
a list of criteria for the selection of suitable candidates for 
the Supervisory Board."
"The Nomination Committee also 
proposes suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for 
the election of shareholder representatives to Supervisory 
Board committees and as chairs of the respective committees."
"Conference Committee 
If the first round of voting concerning the appointment or 
dismissal of members of the Board of Management does 
not result in the required two-thirds majority, the matter 
will be addressed by the Conference Committee before a 
second vote is held on the Supervisory Board."
"Remuneration of Supervisory Board members 
The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory  
Board is laid down in the Articles of Association."
"The 
remuneration report contains detailed information on  
the remuneration paid to the members of the Supervisory 
Board."
"The resolution of the Annual General Meeting on 
the system of remuneration for members of the 
Supervisory Board dated 28 April 2021 and the 
remuneration report (including the Auditor’s opinion)  
are available at www.munichre.com/supervisory-board."
"Other corporate governance practices 
Munich Re Code of Conduct 
Our business activities are embedded in a compliance 
culture based on our ethical principles."
"Our Munich Re 
Code of Conduct defines our guidelines for responsible  
and compliant behaviour."
"More specifically, the Munich Re Code of Conduct describes 
our fundamental standards for fair and responsible 
behaviour – by preventing corruption, for instance – to 
foster an inclusive and diverse working environment as  
well as a culture of trust and transparency."
"In addition,  
the Munich Re Code of Conduct lays out our commitment 
to sustainability and human rights, in alignment with the 
principles of the UN Global Compact."
"Further information can be found on our website at 
www.munichre.com/code-of-conduct."
"UN Global Compact 
To make clear our understanding of important values inside 
and outside our Group, Munich Re joined the United 
Nations Global Compact in 2007."
"The ten principles of this 
declaration (covering human rights, labour standards, 
environmental protection and combating corruption) form 
the heart of our sustainability strategy."
"Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) 
Munich Re was one of the first signatories of the PRI in 
2006."
"We implement the principles for sustainable 
investment through our Group investment function GIM 
and our asset manager MEAG, for example."
"Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) 
Beyond the PRI, we joined the NZAOA in 2020."
"We have 
committed to moving our investment portfolio towards a 
net-zero climate target by 2050 in the spirit of meeting the 
Paris climate targets."
"Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSIs) 
The PSIs – which Munich Re committed to in 2012 as  
one of the first signatories – reflect our commitment to 
anchoring environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
aspects in our core business."
"We also release annual 
progress reports, detailing our dedication to the four 
fundamental principles."
"Further information on these voluntary  
commitments is available on our Sustainability  
Portal at www.munichre.com/sustainability."
"Equal participation of men and 
women in management positions 
As at 31 December 2023, the percentage of women on the 
Board of Management was 20%; with 13.2% at the first 
management level and 28.6% at the second management 
level."
"At the second 
management level, the percentage has continued to increase."
"The management levels are defined as follows: A manager 
at the first management level reports to a member of the 
Board of Management."
"A manager at the second 
management level reports to a manager at the first 
management level."
"For these purposes, only staff members 
with disciplinary responsibility are categorised as managers."
"We aim to increase female representation in management 
positions by taking targeted measures and providing a variety 
of offerings."
"These include women’s networks, mentoring, 
training and coaching programmes, career counselling, and 
childcare as well as part-time and parental leave offerings."
"The share of women in management positions is monitored 
on a quarterly basis throughout the Group, with a special 
focus on the process of staffing management positions at 
the first and second management levels, in order to keep 
track of developments and identify potential issues."
"Women make up 44% of the Group 
Management Platform (the top Group-wide talent 
programme)."
"Moreover, 46% of Hydrogen and 50% of 
Oxygen participants are women (talent programmes in 
reinsurance)."
"And women constitute 50% of people in 
Grow (ERGO), and 53% in MEAG’s Leadership Journey  
(as at 31 December 2023)."
This focused approach is bearing fruit.
"Globally, the share 
of women in management positions within the Group has 
continued to increase, amounting to 39.5% as at 
31 December 2023."
"We are thus getting ever closer to our 
commitment of achieving a 40% share of women across all 
management levels worldwide."
"Moreover, in accordance with legislation and the objectives 
concerning the composition of the Supervisory Board, at 
least 30% of seats on the Supervisory Board of Munich 
Reinsurance Company must be filled by women, and at least 
30% by men."
"In accordance with the Co-Determination Agreement,  
the employee and shareholder representatives ensure 
separate compliance with the statutory gender quotas  
on the Supervisory Board."
"On 31 December 2023, 60% of seats on the Supervisory 
Board of Munich Reinsurance Company were occupied by 
men and 40% by women – four women were shareholder 
representatives and four were employee representatives."
"The minimum requirements are thus met by both sets of 
representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"Diversity concepts for the Board of 
Management and Supervisory Board 
Diversity is taken into account when filling management 
positions in the Company and in the composition of the 
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board."
"In 
addition, diversity is an important part of the Munich Re 
Group’s corporate culture."
"Diversity concept for the Board of 
Management 
When appointing members of the Board of Management, 
the Supervisory Board is mindful of diversity in terms of 
professional and educational background, internationality, 
age, and gender."
"The aim is to ensure that the Board’s 
composition is as diverse as possible, complementary, and 
strong as a whole."
"Gender diversity is described in the 
section entitled “Equal participation of men and women in 
management positions”."
"Members of the Board of Management bear individual 
responsibility for the divisions they head, and joint 
responsibility for overall management of the Company."
"In addition to the specific knowledge and experience 
required for each division, all Board members must have a 
sufficiently broad range of knowledge and experience in all 
areas of our business to ensure that they can monitor each 
other."
"To implement the requirements of Solvency II, the Board of 
Management and Supervisory Board have adopted a Fit 
and Proper Policy; this policy sets out fitness and propriety 
requirements for Board members and other persons."
"Accordingly, it must be ensured that the members of the 
Board of Management have the necessary qualifications in 
their respective individual areas of responsibility."
"The differences between the business models within  
the Group and between divisions in the reinsurance field  
of business require that the Board of Management have  
a broad professional and educational background."
"In its current composition, the Board of Management 
shows a diverse range of professional training and education."
"It includes graduates of various degrees and vocational 
training (e.g."
"business and economics, mathematics, physics, 
and political science)."
"The CVs of the individual members 
of the Board of Management have different focuses – in 
operative business, in certain markets, or in specialist areas."
"The diverse careers and personalities within the Board of 
Management express the versatility of our business model, 
and reflect the complex requirements faced by the Board."
The internationality of the Board is also taken into account.
"The global business activities of Munich Re mean that all 
members of the Board of Management have international 
management experience."
"The average age of the members of the Board of Management 
at the end of the 2023 financial year was 52; the youngest 
Board member was 39, and the oldest was 58."
"The age 
limit for membership of the Board of Management is 67; 
members of the Board of Management must leave the 
Board no later than the end of the calendar year in which 
they turn 67."
The requirements for age limits are thus met.
"First-time appointments of members of the Board of 
Management are as a rule for a period of three years."
"A reappointment more than one year before the end of  
the appointment period with simultaneous cancellation  
of the current appointment will only be made in special 
circumstances."
"In conjunction with the Board of 
Management, the Personnel Committee is also responsible 
for succession planning."
"Succession planning for the Board 
of Management is systematic and geared to the strategic 
objectives and future challenges of the Group."
"A new and 
uniform Group-wide process was launched in 2023 to  
help identify particularly talented senior managers."
"This 
approach provides a comprehensive strategic overview of 
all talented staff throughout the Group; it also fosters the 
mobility of talented people, while ensuring a robust, diverse 
and sustainable talent pipeline."
"Our new process has given 
rise to the Top Talent Pool, which provides a starting point 
for Board of Management succession planning."
"The CVs of the members of the Board of Management  
are updated regularly and can be found at 
www.munichre.com/board-of-management."
"Gender diversity is described in the section 
“Equal participation of men and women in management 
positions”."
"Members of the Supervisory Board of Munich Reinsurance 
Company must meet fitness and propriety requirements."
"Overseeing the Company professionally and competently 
and actively accompanying its development demands an 
appropriate level of diversity on the Supervisory Board in 
terms of qualifications, knowledge and relevant experience."
"The Supervisory Board has set itself specific objectives 
concerning its composition and has defined requirements 
regarding the competences of the Supervisory Board as  
a whole."
"Moreover, sets of criteria have been adopted for 
employee representatives and shareholder representatives, 
respectively."
"Appropriate knowledge of the following fields is also required: 
risk management, accounting, auditing, controlling and 
internal audit, asset-liability management, law, regulatory 
supervision, compliance, tax, human resources management 
and sustainability matters of significance to the Company."
"The competence profile also includes a good overall 
understanding of the business model."
"The members of the 
Supervisory Board must collectively be familiar with the 
sector in which the Company operates."
"Any additional requirements for specific duties will be 
defined on a case-by-case basis, in particular taking into 
account legal requirements and the competence profile."
"At least one member of the Audit Committee must have 
expertise in the field of accounting and at least one other 
member of the Audit Committee must have expertise in the 
field of auditing."
"Accounting 
and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its 
audit and assurance."
"When proposing candidates for election to the Supervisory 
Board, the Supervisory Board generally only considers 
nominees aged 70 or under (target age limit)."
"The Supervisory 
Board has deliberately opted for a flexible target age limit, 
which provides sufficient room for manoeuvre for assessing 
the circumstances of the individual case."
"This expands the 
pool of potential candidates and allows in particular for the 
re-election of members of the Supervisory Board with many 
years of experience."
"Future nominations of candidates for 
election to the Supervisory Board should also take into 
account that at the time of election no candidate should 
already have been on the Supervisory Board for a continuous 
period of more than ten years."
"Normally, Supervisory Board 
members should not serve on the Board for a continuous 
period of more than twelve years."
"As many members as 
possible of the Supervisory Board must have no relevant 
(material and not only temporary) conflicts of interest."
"This Committee draws up a requirements 
profile to be used in the selection process."
"Shareholders 
receive the detailed CVs of the respective candidates when 
 
 
Corporate governance 
137 
Statement on Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB) 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
the Annual General Meeting is convened."
"When selecting 
candidates, care is taken to achieve diversity in terms of the 
composition of the Supervisory Board to ensure that the 
Supervisory Board as a whole fits the required competence 
profile."
"Half of the members of the Supervisory Board are elected 
representatives of Group employees in the EU/EEA."
"The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board  
are governed by special co-determination rules under the 
Co-Determination Agreement."
"The Co-Determination 
Agreement also specifies a corresponding set of diversity 
criteria for the employee representatives, which serves as  
a basis for electing employee representatives to the 
Supervisory Board."
"The bodies responsible for making 
election nominations under the Co-Determination 
Agreement should take these criteria into account within 
the limits prescribed by applicable regulations to ensure 
that the diversity criteria and other requirements are met."
"In its current composition, the Supervisory Board 
demonstrates diversity of professional training and 
education, and also has the overall knowledge, expertise 
and professional experience necessary for the proper 
performance of its duties."
"Members have diverse 
professional and educational focuses (including law, 
economics, mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, 
and commercial and insurance-specific training)."
"The 
Supervisory Board members also have management 
experience in various sectors (such as finance and 
insurance, software, automotive, aviation, pharmaceutical 
industry), and extensive experience in academia."
"This expertise also includes sustainability 
reporting and its audit and assurance."
"The shareholder 
representatives on the Audit Committee and Supervisory 
Board member Gerd Häusler thus qualify as financial experts 
within the meaning of Section 100(5) of the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG) and recommendation D.3 GCGC."
"Ann-Kristin 
Achleitner qualifies as a financial expert due to her many 
years of experience teaching at universities and serving  
on numerous supervisory board committees and audit 
committees of listed companies over the years."
"Nikolaus 
von Bomhard possesses the requisite knowledge and 
experience in accounting and auditing due to his thirteen 
years as Chair of the Board of Management of Munich 
Reinsurance Company and his many years as Chair of the 
Supervisory Board of Deutsche Post AG."
"Since 2018,  
he has also been chairing the Audit Committee of listed 
company Auto1 Group SE."
"The above members of the Audit Committee 
and Supervisory Board member Gerd Häusler keep track of 
current developments in the fields of accounting, auditing 
and sustainability reporting."
"In addition, Maximilian Zimmerer, Ann-Kristin Achleitner, 
Nikolaus von Bomhard and Gerd Häusler possess recognised 
sustainability expertise."
"As a result, all shareholder representatives in the Audit 
Committee and in the Praesidium and Sustainability 
Committee are both financial experts and sustainability 
experts."
"On a scale of A to E, 
this corresponds to an evaluation of at least B."
"2 
In conformity with the GCGC (recommendations on independence relate to shareholder representatives only)."
"The members of the Supervisory Board have no relevant 
(material and not only temporary) conflicts of interest."
"3 
Skills and experience with regard to the markets, business processes, competition and the requirements of reinsurance and primary insurance (life and non-life)."
"4 
Investment, asset-liability management."
"5 
Accounting, controlling."
"6 
Risk management (including internal control processes)."
"7 
Internal model: For calculation of the solvency capital requirement under Solvency II."
"8 
Law, regulatory supervision, compliance, internal audit, tax."
"9 
Result of a supplementary query (without a rating scale) as part of the annual self-assessment."
"Most of the members of the Supervisory Board also have 
international experience."
"The members of the Supervisory 
Board come from a number of different countries, which 
reflects the Company’s international activities."
"The average age of members of the Supervisory Board at 
the end of the 2023 financial year was 62; the youngest 
Board member was 53, and the oldest was 72."
"There is 
therefore a sufficient age mix on the Supervisory Board."
"The CVs of the members of the Supervisory Board can be 
found at www.munichre.com/supervisory-board."
"They are 
updated as required, at least once a year."
"Independence 
The shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board 
aim to ensure that, as far as possible, all candidates whom 
they propose to the Annual General Meeting for election 
are independent."
"In implementing the German Corporate Governance Code, 
the shareholder representatives have set themselves the 
objective of having at least eight independent shareholder 
representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"Taking into account the ownership structure, the shareholder 
representatives are of the opinion that all ten shareholder 
representatives meet the independence criteria of the 
German Corporate Governance Code."
"Specifically, the Chair 
of the Supervisory Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, 
and the Chair of the committee that addresses the 
remuneration of the Board of Management are thus 
independent within the meaning of the GCGC."
"material and not only temporary, conflict of interest in 
their view or in the view of the Company, (vii) has been a 
partner or employee of the auditors during the past three 
years and/or (viii) has been a member of the Supervisory

"We only add plus or

"Comparative information 
Munich Re is applying IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and 
IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, for the first time with effect 
from 1 January 2023."
"In the initial application of IFRS 9,  
we have made use of the option not to restate comparative 
information, except when we apply the classification 
overlay approach permissible under IFRS 17."
"For insurance 
contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, however, the 
transition date is the beginning of the financial year prior to 
the date of initial application."
"The comparative information 
for insurance items recognised in accordance with IFRS 17 
has therefore been restated."
"In connection with the initial application of IFRS 17, we 
have restated the comparative information for some of our 
investment property or owner-occupied property."
"These are 
assets previously recognised at amortised cost, which back 
insurance contracts with direct participation features."
"Further comments can be found under Accounting policies 
> Changes in accounting policies and other adjustments 
> Effects from the initial application of IFRS 17."
"Otherwise, the comparative information was calculated on 
the same basis as in the 2023 financial year."
"In connection with the initial application of the new 
accounting standards, the structure of the consolidated 
balance sheet has been revised, the names of the statements 
and line items adapted, and changes made to the consolidated 
cash flow statement."
"Comparative figures have been 
reclassified accordingly."
"Further comments can be found 
under Accounting policies > Changes in accounting 
policies and other adjustments > Change in presentation 
and classification."
"Our internal processes are geared to determining amounts 
as accurately as possible, taking into account all the relevant 
information to the best of the management’s knowledge."
"Nevertheless, it is in the nature of these items that estimates 
may have to be adjusted in the course of time to take account 
of new knowledge."
"Discretionary judgements and estimates are of significance 
for the following items in particular."
"Further information can 
be found in the relevant disclosures under “Consolidation”, 
“Overarching accounting policies”, “Assets” and “Equity and 
liabilities”, and under Explanatory information > Notes to 
the financial instruments and fair value disclosures on assets 
and liabilities."
"Discretionary judgements 
Determining the basis of consolidation 
When determining whether an entity should be included  
in the consolidated group, we assess whether Munich Re 
exercises control or a significant influence, or has joint 
control, over that entity."
"Consolidated financial statements 
156 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
An assessment of these criteria requires that a certain 
degree of judgement be exercised."
"Aside from considering 
the purpose and design of the investee, we must also 
analyse in particular what its relevant activities are, how 
decisions about those activities are made and whether  
our existing rights give us the current ability to direct the 
relevant activities."
"In addition to our share of the voting 
rights in the investee, we also consider other circumstances 
and facts, the assessment of which in turn often requires 
the application of judgement."
"In addition, 
in assessing whether control exists for structured entities, we 
take into account factors including the agency relationships 
between the parties."
"Classification and impairment of financial assets 
The classification of financial assets is based on the 
business model in which the financial assets are managed 
and the SPPI test."
"The business model is determined  
based on several factors, such as the risks that affect the 
performance of the business model and the way in which 
those risks are managed as well as how the performance is 
evaluated and reported to management."
"In some instances, 
determining the business model under which certain 
financial assets are managed requires the exercise of 
judgement."
"The recognition of loss allowances under the expected 
credit-loss model requires that criteria be defined to 
determine whether the credit risk on a financial asset has 
increased significantly since initial recognition."
"The definition 
of such criteria relies on a certain degree of judgement."
"Classification of insurance contracts 
In the course of conducting our risk transfer test, we assess 
whether contracts transfer a significant insurance risk."
"In 
cases where it is found that a significant insurance risk is 
transferred, the contracts are accounted for in accordance 
with the provisions of IFRS 17."
"Otherwise, the contracts 
usually represent financial instruments which fall under the 
scope of IFRS 9."
"We regularly exercise judgement when 
performing the risk transfer test and when assessing whether 
it is necessary to separate certain contractual components 
(investment components, non-insurance service components 
and embedded derivatives)."
"Measurement of insurance contracts 
Insurance contracts falling under the scope of IFRS 17 are 
measured at the level of groups of insurance contracts."
"To  
a certain extent, judgement is exercised when identifying 
portfolios and defining groups of insurance contracts based 
on the profitability of those contracts."
"In addition, determining 
the procedures to set the discount rates and the risk 
adjustment for non-financial risks requires the use of 
judgement."
"Furthermore, a certain degree of judgement must 
be exercised when systematically allocating certain fixed and 
variable overheads to groups of insurance contracts and 
establishing coverage units."
"IFRS 17 transition approaches 
Certain transition approaches are applied upon initial 
application of IFRS 17, depending on the availability of the 
information required."
"Estimates and assumptions 
Impairment of intangible assets 
For certain intangible assets, the assessment as to whether 
there is indication of impairment is performed at the level 
of the cash-generating unit."
"This relates in particular to 
goodwill impairment testing."
"Value in use, which serves as 
the basis for calculating the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating units, is determined based on estimated 
distributable target results, taking into account a number  
of assumptions."
"The cost-of-equity rate, derived from the 
capital asset pricing model (CAPM), is used as the discount 
rate."
"The valuation is thus based on the risk-free rate, the 
beta factor, and a market risk premium – and an additional 
risk premium, if necessary."
"Impairment of financial instruments 
The key parameters for calculating expected credit losses 
are the probability of default, the loss given default and the 
exposure at default."
"The probability of default is the basis for specifying a stage 
of the impairment model."
"In addition, the probability of 
default is considered whenever expected credit losses are 
calculated."
"During our internal rating process, the probability 
of default is calculated on the basis of historical data, 
current market conditions, and assumptions about the future."
"The loss given default and the exposure at default are 
likewise factored into calculations of expected credit losses."
"In this context, the loss given default is derived from the 
recovery and default studies published by rating agencies."
"The exposure at default corresponds to the gross carrying 
amount as at the reporting date."
"Consolidated financial statements 
157 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Measurement of insurance contracts 
The measurement of insurance contracts is subject to 
substantial estimates based on the assumptions used."
"In particular, estimates are made when determining the 
fulfilment cash flows."
"This is particularly the case when  
it comes to determining the future cash flows which will 
arise when the insurance contracts are fulfilled, as well as 
when determining discount rates and the risk adjustment 
for non-financial risks."
"Estimates of future cash flows are based on reasonable and 
supportable information that is available without undue 
cost or effort."
"Internal and external sets of historical data as 
well as current conditions are considered when portraying 
expectations as to future developments."
"The purpose of 
estimating future cash flows is to determine the expected 
value (probability-weighted mean) for the entire range of 
potential events."
"Estimates of future cash flows are made 
on the basis of assumptions such as those with regard to 
mortality, disability, policyholder behaviour and participation, 
as well as claims payments and settlement costs."
"Estimates of future cash flows are discounted to reflect  
the time value of money."
"The discount rates selected must 
be as consistent as possible with the overall cash flow 
characteristics of the groups of insurance contracts."
"We 
determine discount rates by using a bottom-up approach, 
with the Solvency II interest-rate curves published by the 
supervisory authority EIOPA (European Insurance and 
Occupational Pensions Authority) serving as the starting 
point for risk-free interest rates."
"If relevant, we factor in the 
effect of illiquidity premiums on the interest-rate curves  
to take account of the differences in liquidity between the 
insurance liabilities and the liquid reference instruments 
used in determining risk-free interest rates."
"In order to account for the uncertainty arising from non-
financial risk pertaining to the amount and the timing of 
cash flows, the estimate of the present value of future 
expected cash flows is subject to an explicit risk adjustment 
to reflect non-financial risk."
"We determine the risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk using a cost-of-capital 
method and on the basis of our internal risk model, taking 
into account Group-wide risk diversification."
"More 
specifically, we apply a cost-of-capital rate of 6% to the 
amount of capital required as at each future reporting date 
on a going-concern basis, and we discount the result using 
the risk-free rates adjusted for illiquidity."
"The parameters used reflect the assumptions 
regarding the factors that market players would consider  
in their pricing."
"Provisions for post-employment benefits 
The measurement of provisions for post-employment 
benefits requires that assumptions be made as to future 
development and is therefore subject to estimation 
uncertainty."
"In the measurement, recognised biometric 
actuarial assumptions are applied, particularly with  
respect to life expectancy, together with further actuarial 
assumptions."
"These above all concern the actuarial interest 
rate, future entitlement and salary increases, and future 
pension and cost trends."
"Deferred tax assets 
Deferred tax assets are recognised with respect to temporary 
differences between the amounts reported in the consolidated 
balance sheet and the tax accounts."
"Also included are tax 
assets deriving from tax loss carry-forwards."
"Deferred tax 
assets are recognised if there are sufficient taxable temporary 
differences which are expected to reverse in the same 
period as the deductible temporary differences."
"For any 
additional deductible temporary differences, deferred tax 
assets are only recognised if it is considered probable that 
future profits will be available in the same period in which 
the deductible temporary differences are expected to reverse."
"This means that estimates and assumptions as to the 
future availability of profits must be made when accounting 
for deferred tax assets."
"Contingent liabilities 
In the case of contingent liabilities, judgements and estimates 
are necessary for assessing whether a present obligation 
exists, an outflow of resources is regarded as likely, and 
whether it is possible to make a sufficiently reliable estimate 
for an obligation."
"This is the case, for example, with respect 
to contingent liabilities in legal disputes."
"Consolidation 
Consolidation principles 
Fully consolidated entities 
The consolidated financial statements include Munich 
Reinsurance Company and all the entities over which 
Munich Reinsurance Company directly or indirectly 
exercises control (subsidiaries)."
"Consolidated financial statements 
158 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Munich Reinsurance Company directly or indirectly holds 
all, or a clear majority of, the voting rights in most of the 
entities included in the consolidated group."
"We include a small number of entities in the consolidated 
group on the basis that contractual rights are taken into 
consideration that result in determination of control over 
the relevant business activities."
"In assessing the need to 
consolidate shares in investment funds, we take particular 
account of the degree of variability in the remuneration  
of the fund manager, of dismissal rights, and of the role of 
the investors in committees and bodies of the investment 
fund."
"As a result, an assessment that we do exercise  
control sometimes occurs even though the shareholding  
is below 50%."
"In assessing whether control exists for structured entities, 
we focus our analysis on the remaining decisions within the 
corresponding unit and on the agency relationships between 
the parties."
"For structured entities used by us to issue 
catastrophe bonds, we focus above all on our relationship to 
the trustees and our possibilities to influence their decision-
making."
"Generally, we do not control such structured entities, 
even if we hold their bonds."
"A list of all our shareholdings can be found in the section 
“List of shareholdings as at 31 December 2023 pursuant to 
Section 313(2) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)”."
"Associates and joint ventures 
Entities and special funds are considered associates if  
we are able to significantly influence their financial and 
operating policies."
"We regularly operate on this assumption 
if we hold between 20% and 50% of the voting power or 
similar rights, unless the financial and operating policies of 
the entity or special fund are largely pre-determined."
"Entities and special funds are considered joint ventures if 
we are able to determine their relevant operations solely by 
unanimous agreement of all parties entitled to joint control, 
and we only have rights to their net assets."
"We recognise our share of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses of joint operations in which we have joint control 
in the balance sheet in accordance with the relevant IFRSs."
"Overarching accounting policies 
Financial instruments 
Our financial instruments are presented under the 
following items in the consolidated balance sheet: 
− Financial assets: D.II."
"Financial investments, E."
"Investments

"Financial receivables, and

"Non-derivative financial liabilities,

"Other liabilities (primarily consists of financial 
instruments) 
For information on specific items, please refer to “Assets” 
and “Equity and liabilities”."
"We began recognising financial instruments as per IFRS 9 
in the 2023 financial year."
"Financial assets 
 
Recognition and derecognition 
We recognise a financial asset in the consolidated balance 
sheet at the time when we become a party to the contractual 
provisions of the financial instrument."
"When the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from 
a financial asset have expired, we derecognise that asset."
"If a financial asset is transferred, we evaluate whether the 
derecognition requirements of IFRS 9 are met."
"In this 
process, we take into account the extent to which we retain 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset 
and – if applicable – whether we retain control."
"Depending 
on the outcome of this evaluation, we derecognise the 
financial asset, or we continue to recognise it in full or to the 
extent of our continuing involvement."
"Financial liabilities are 
recognised and derecognised as at the trade date."
"Classification 
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified as measured at “amortised cost”, “fair 
value through other comprehensive income” or “fair value 
through profit or loss”."
"Consolidated financial statements 
159 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
The classification is determined on the basis of the business 
model for managing the financial assets and the contractual 
cash flow characteristics of the financial assets."
"Business model 
An entity’s business model refers to how the entity 
manages the financial assets in order to generate cash 
flows."
"A distinction is made between 
the following business models: 
In the business model “hold to collect”, the financial assets 
are managed with the objective to collect contractual  
cash flows."
"The sale of financial assets is not part of the 
management strategy, but is, under certain circumstances, 
not incompatible with the application of this business 
model, for example if there is an increase in the financial 
asset’s credit risk."
"The objective of the business model “hold to collect and 
sell” is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling financial assets."
"The sale of assets is a key 
aspect of the management of the portfolio."
"The business model “other” applies to financial assets that 
are managed neither under the “hold to collect” nor under 
the “hold to collect and sell” business models."
"This is the 
case, for example, if the objective of the business model is 
in particular to realise cash flows by selling assets, or if a 
group of financial assets is managed on the basis of their 
fair value."
"Contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding are 
consistent with a basic lending arrangement and pass the 
SPPI test."
"In a basic lending arrangement, compensation for 
the time value of money and for the credit risk are typically 
the most significant elements of interest."
"In addition, 
interest may include compensation for other basic lending 
risks (such as the liquidity risk) and costs (such as 
administration costs) as well as an appropriate profit margin 
consistent with a basic lending arrangement."
"Measurement 
 
Measurement on initial recognition 
On initial recognition at the trade date, financial assets  
are recognised at the transaction price or fair value."
"For 
financial assets that are not subsequently measured at fair 
value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction 
costs must be included in addition."
"Subsequent measurement 
The measurement of a financial asset after initial 
recognition is based on the classification in accordance 
with the business model and the result of the SPPI test."
"Financial assets managed within the business model  
“hold to collect” that pass the SPPI test are measured at 
amortised cost."
"At Munich Re, this includes in particular 
financial receivables and cash and cash equivalents."
"Financial assets subject to the business model “hold to 
collect and sell” that pass the SPPI test are measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive income."
"This 
includes the major part of our financial investments."
"They 
are mostly used to back insurance liabilities and are 
managed as part of our asset-liability management on the 
basis of their duration and risk profile."
"This means that the 
management strategy is aimed at both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets."
"Financial assets that are managed under the business 
model “other” or that do not pass the SPPI test are measured 
at fair value through profit or loss."
"In view of the business 
model, at Munich Re, this includes in particular the 
investments for unit-linked life insurance and the insurance-
related financial instruments – such as insurance contracts 
that do not transfer significant insurance risk."
"Derivatives and equity instruments are generally measured 
at fair value through profit or loss."
"Munich Re does not 
make use of the option to designate equity instruments as 
“measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income”."
"We present investments in affiliated companies, 
associates and joint ventures that are not consolidated 
because they are immaterial under non-financial investments 
and, in the interest of simplicity, measure them in the same 
way as equity instruments."
"Accordingly, on transition to 
IFRS 9, we now measure these investments at “fair value 
through profit or loss” and no longer at “fair value through 
other comprehensive income”."
"Contracts with embedded derivatives where the host 
contract is not a financial asset within the scope of IFRS 9 
may under certain circumstances be designated as measured 
at “fair value through profit or loss”."
"In addition, financial assets may be irrevocably designated 
as measured at “fair value through profit or loss” on initial 
recognition if this eliminates or significantly reduces 
accounting mismatches."
"This is of minor significance for 
Munich Re."
"Impairment 
IFRS 9 calls for using an expected credit loss model to 
recognise impairment losses, under which expected credit 
losses are anticipated before they arise and must be 
recognised as an expense."
"These impairment requirements 
primarily affect financial assets measured at amortised cost 
or at fair value through other comprehensive income, as well 
as lease receivables."
"A three-stage impairment model is used to recognise and 
measure impairment losses on financial assets."
"Stage 1: On initial recognition, financial instruments are 
always assigned to Stage 1 of the impairment model and 
they remain at Stage 1 if their credit risk has not increased 
significantly since they were initially recognised."
"The loss 
allowance is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month 
expected credit losses, which represents the expected 
credit losses that result from default events that may occur 
within 12 months of the reporting date."
"Stage 2: If the credit risk of a financial instrument has 
increased significantly since initial recognition but there is 
no objective evidence of impairment, the loss allowance at 
Stage 2 of the impairment model is measured at an amount 
equal to the lifetime expected credit loss."
"Stage 3: If in addition to a significant increase in credit risk, 
there is objective evidence of impairment, the instrument is 
allocated to Stage 3 of the impairment model (credit-
impaired financial assets)."
"As in Stage 2, the loss allowance 
is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected 
credit losses."
"Interest revenue is calculated by applying the 
effective interest method – unlike in Stage 1 and Stage 2 – on 
the basis of the net carrying amount of the financial asset 
(i.e."
after deducting the loss allowance).
"As a matter of principle, a significant increase in credit risk is 
assumed if this risk (measured in terms of the probability of 
default) has increased by more than two percentage points 
since the financial instrument was initially recognised."
"We assume that the credit risk of a financial instrument 
has not increased significantly if it has low credit risk as at 
the reporting date (low credit risk exception)."
"For financial instruments with an internal MEAG rating,  
we generally assume that changes in the risk of a default 
occurring over the next 12 months are a reasonable 
approximation of the changes in the lifetime risk of a 
default occurring."
"If there are indications that only an 
assessment based on the entire lifetime of the financial 
instrument is appropriate, such an assessment is made."
"We generally make use of the rebuttable presumption that 
the credit risk has increased significantly since initial 
recognition if a contractual payment is more than 30 days 
past due, unless we have evidence to the contrary."
"To measure expected credit losses, we use the probability of 
default, the loss given default and the exposure at default."
"Expected credit losses are equal to the discounted product 
of these three components."
"The calculation includes 
probability-weighted scenarios that take account of 
reasonable and supportable information that is available 
without disproportionate cost or effort as at the reporting 
date and incorporates past events, current conditions and 
forecasts of future economic conditions."
"Financial assets are written off if, based on a reasonable 
assessment, it must be assumed that these assets are not 
recoverable."
"Indicators for this include a debtor lacking 
sufficient assets to service their debts or failing to commit 
to a repayment schedule."
"Upon completion of insolvency 
proceedings against a debtor, the financial assets are 
likewise deemed to be no longer recoverable and are fully 
derecognised."
"Such write-offs do not have an impact on 
profit or loss since the amounts are reflected in the loss 
allowance and therefore have already been recognised 
previously through profit or loss."
"Our investment guidelines do not provide for the 
acquisition of purchased or originated credit-impaired 
financial assets."
"Consolidated financial statements 
161 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
We do not exercise the option to measure loss allowances 
on lease receivables using the simplified approach, i.e."
"at an 
amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses."
"Financial liabilities 
 
Recognition and derecognition 
We recognise financial liabilities in the consolidated 
balance sheet at the time when we become a party to  
the contractual provisions of the financial instrument."
"We derecognise financial liabilities when they are 
extinguished, i.e."
"when the obligations specified in  
the contract are discharged, are cancelled, or expire."
"Financial liabilities are recognised and derecognised  
as at the trade date."
"Classification 
For subsequent measurement, IFRS 9 specifies that 
financial liabilities must be classified as “measured  
at amortised cost” or “measured at fair value through  
profit or loss”."
"Measurement 
 
Measurement on initial recognition 
On initial recognition on the trade date, financial liabilities 
are recognised at the transaction price or fair value."
"For 
financial liabilities that are not subsequently measured at fair 
value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction 
costs must also be included."
"Subsequent measurement 
Most of our financial liabilities are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method."
"This includes 
primarily the subordinated liabilities reported separately  
in the consolidated balance sheet and bonds as well as 
liabilities to credit institutions presented under non-derivative 
financial liabilities."
"The category of financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss at Munich Re includes predominantly the 
derivative liabilities reported separately in the consolidated 
balance sheet."
"In addition, we have made loan commitments 
to a small extent."
"Since the financial instruments arising 
from these loan commitments are subsequently measured at 
fair value, we recognise the loan commitments at fair value 
through profit or loss."
"Moreover, most financial liabilities resulting from insurance 
contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are 
managed on a fair value basis."
"Changes in fair value are 
considered when evaluating the performance of these 
contracts, which then serves as the basis for reporting to 
management."
"For these contracts, we exercise the option  
to designate them as measured at “fair value through profit 
or loss”."
"In addition, contracts with embedded derivatives where the 
host contract is not a financial asset within the scope of 
IFRS 9 may under certain circumstances be designated as 
measured at “fair value through profit or loss”."
"Embedded derivatives 
In financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9, embedded 
derivatives are not separated from the host contract."
"Instead, the financial asset is classified on the basis of the 
entire hybrid contract and in accordance with the general 
rules based on the business model and SPPI criteria."
"Some of our insurance contracts and financial liabilities 
contain embedded derivatives."
"If embedded derivatives are separated from the host 
contract, they are measured at fair value through profit  
or loss."
We chiefly offset derivatives.
"Our other business 
transactions generally do not meet the requirements for 
offsetting."
"Additional information can be found under Explanatory 
information > Notes to the financial instruments and fair 
value disclosures on assets and liabilities > 45 Offsetting  
of financial assets and liabilities."
"Transfers of financial assets 
We assess the recognition of our repurchase agreements 
and our securities lending transactions in line with the 
requirements for the derecognition of financial assets and 
liabilities."
"Under repurchase agreements we, as the repurchase buyer, 
acquire securities with the obligation to sell them back to the 
repurchase seller at a later date."
"As the risks and rewards 
from the securities remain with the repurchase seller, the 
amounts paid are not posted as such in our accounts; they 
are instead presented under financial receivables as a 
receivable from the repurchase seller."
"Interest income from 
these transactions is recognised in the investment result."
"Similarly, securities sold by us as the repurchase seller are 
not derecognised, and the amount received from the 
repurchase buyer is shown as a liability in our accounts."
"Securities that we lend by way of securities lending continue 
to be recognised in our consolidated balance sheet, as the 
main risks and rewards remain with Munich Re; securities 
that we have borrowed are accordingly not recognised in the 
consolidated balance sheet."
"Fees from securities lending 
are recognised in the investment result."
"Hedge accounting 
Hedge accounting is of minor significance for Munich Re."
"Munich Re enters into cash flow hedges to a small extent, 
hedging in particular the cash flow risk from variable 
interest payments."
"In this process, the portion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an 
effective hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income."
"The ineffective portion of the hedge, on the other hand, is 
recognised in profit or loss."
"In the period in which the hedged  
cash flows affect profit or loss, the cumulated amount  
recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to 
the consolidated income statement."
"Munich Re mainly uses 
interest-rate swaps for this type of hedging."
"Additional information can be found under Explanatory 
information > Notes to the financial instruments and fair 
value disclosures on assets and liabilities > 47 Hedge 
accounting."
"Fair value 
IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value as  
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid  
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date."
"The allocation of an instrument to a level indicates the extent 
to which observable market inputs helped to measure the 
instrument."
"If market prices are available, these constitute 
the most objective yardstick for measurement at fair value 
and are to be used."
"If measurement is carried out using a 
model, any available inputs observable in the market are 
used first."
"If necessary, these inputs are supplemented with 
unobservable inputs."
"In the case of Level 1, valuation is based on quoted prices  
in active markets for identical financial instruments which 
Munich Re can refer to at the valuation date."
"The financial 
instruments we have allocated to this level mainly comprise 
equities, equity funds and exchange-traded derivatives."
"Assets allocated to Level 2 are valued using models based 
on observable market data."
"The inputs used for valuation 
must be observable throughout the instrument’s contract 
period."
"In addition, Level 2 includes assets and liabilities for 
which valuation and the market data required for valuation 
are provided by price quoters, but for which it is not possible 
to completely determine to which extent the data used is 
observable in the market."
"The financial instruments we have 
allocated to Level 2 mainly comprise bearer bonds, bond 
funds, promissory note loans, covered bonds, subordinated 
securities, specified credit structures, derivatives not traded 
on the stock market and subordinated liabilities."
"Moreover, 
we have allocated a majority of our financial receivables and 
liabilities to Level 2."
"Consolidated financial statements 
163 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
We allocate to Level 3 assets and liabilities for which 
unobservable market inputs have a significant impact on 
valuation."
"The inputs used reflect Munich Re’s assumptions 
regarding the factors which market players would consider 
in their pricing."
"To this end, we use the best available 
market information, supplemented with internal company 
data."
"The assets allocated to this level of the fair value 
hierarchy largely comprise investment property, owner-
occupied property, and real estate funds."
"Funds that mainly 
invest in theoretically valued instruments, and investments 
in infrastructure and in private equity are also allocated to 
Level 3, along with investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures measured at fair value, and insurance-
related financial instruments."
"In the case of instruments not traded on an active market, 
we determine on a case-by-case basis to which level of the 
fair value hierarchy to allocate the respective fair values."
"Additional information on measurement models and 
measurement processes can be found under Explanatory 
information > Notes to the financial instruments and fair 
value disclosures on assets and liabilities > 43 Fair value 
hierarchy for assets and liabilities."
"Insurance contracts 
Our insurance contracts are presented under the following 
items at a portfolio level in the consolidated balance sheet: 
− Assets: B."
"Reinsurance contracts held that are assets,  
and C."
"Insurance contracts issued that are assets 
− Liabilities: C."
"Reinsurance contracts held that are 
liabilities, and D."
"Insurance contracts issued that are 
liabilities 
 
For information on specific items, please refer to “Assets” 
and “Equity and liabilities”."
"We began recognising insurance contracts as per IFRS 17 
in the 2023 financial year."
"Classification as an insurance contract 
A contract is classified as an insurance contract within the 
scope of IFRS 17 if it transfers significant insurance risk."
We make this assessment as part of risk transfer testing.
"We classify an insurance risk as significant if an insured 
event could cause the payment of additional amounts that 
are significant in any single scenario, excluding scenarios 
that have no commercial substance, and there is a 
possibility of a loss on a present-value basis."
"Alternatively, 
we classify contracts as insurance contracts if they transfer 
to the reinsurer substantially all the insurance risk relating 
to the reinsured portions of the underlying insurance 
contracts."
"Contracts that do not transfer significant 
insurance risk are generally financial instruments and are 
accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements."
"An 
exception here are investment contracts with discretionary 
participation features, which fall under the scope of IFRS 17."
"Separation of components 
Insurance contracts can contain one or more of the 
following components: 
− embedded derivatives;  
− investment components;  
− non-insurance services."
"If an insurance contract contains embedded derivatives 
that are themselves not contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, 
IFRS 9 requirements are applied when assessing the 
obligation to separate components and accounting for the 
given derivative."
"We refer to the comments in this chapter 
under Financial instruments > Embedded derivatives."
"Distinct investment components and distinct non-
insurance services are separated from the insurance 
contract and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 
and/or IFRS 15 requirements."
"They are of minor 
significance for Munich Re."
"Munich Re has not identified 
any significant distinct investment components to date."
"Level of aggregation 
Recognition and measurement occur at the level of groups 
of insurance contracts."
"We begin by including insurance 
contracts in a portfolio that are subject to similar risks and 
managed together."
"If there are insurance contracts in 
different currencies but with similar risk profiles, these can 
be in the same portfolio and in the same group of insurance 
contracts if they are managed together."
"We classify an insurance contract as onerous at initial 
recognition if the risk-adjusted present value of all the 
expected cash flows for contract fulfilment results in a net 
cash outflow."
"Due to changes in estimates relating to future 
service, a group of insurance contracts can become onerous 
upon subsequent measurement."
"This nevertheless does not 
affect the classification into different groups at initial 
recognition."
"In other words, the composition of the groups 
is not reassessed."
"We also ensure that all the contracts within a group were 
issued within one year."
"We thus do not make use of the 
option of exempting groups of insurance contracts from  
the annual cohort requirement (annual cohort exemption  
in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/2036 from 
19 November 2021)."
"Measurement 
IFRS 17 provides a consistent accounting model for all 
insurance contracts."
"The basic approach consists in applying 
the general measurement model (GMM), which is mainly 
used in life reinsurance and in parts of property-casualty 
primary insurance business."
"In view of the GMM’s high 
complexity, IFRS 17 provides the option of using – primarily 
for short-term contracts – a simplified measurement model 
known as the premium allocation approach (PAA)."
"We 
apply this simplified measurement approach particularly 
for our property-casualty reinsurance business and for a 
substantial part of our property-casualty primary insurance 
business."
"IFRS 17 also provides for a modified measurement 
model, the variable fee approach (VFA), for certain 
participating primary insurance contracts."
"We apply the 
VFA for eligible life and health primary insurance contracts."
"For all measurement models, there is a distinction between 
a pre-claims stage (liability for remaining coverage – LRC) 
and a claims stage after the occurrence of an insured event 
(liability for incurred claims – LIC)."
"Please see below for 
more detailed explanations of the starting points for the 
valuation approaches."
"General Measurement Model (GMM) 
 
Procedure 
The GMM is based on a building block approach that 
consists of four blocks."
"The expected future cash flows for 
contract fulfilment form the basis for measuring our assets 
and liabilities from insurance business (building block 1)."
"Cash flows are discounted in order to reflect the time value of 
money and the financial risks (building block 2)."
"Comparing 
the present value of expected cash inflows against the 
present value of expected cash outflows results in the  
present value of the net cash flows relevant for the 
measurement."
"This present value is subjected to a risk 
adjustment to reflect the uncertainty arising from non-
financial risk pertaining to the amount and the timing of 
cash flows (building block 3)."
"For groups of insurance 
contracts classified as profitable at initial recognition, we 
recognise a contractual service margin which represents 
the unearned profit (building block 4)."
"The latter is 
recognised over time as insurance contract services are 
provided over the coverage period."
"For subsequent measurement of the LRC, building blocks 1, 
2 and 3 are remeasured using updated assumptions and 
inputs."
"The contractual service margin is adjusted to reflect 
changes in non-financial assumptions of future coverage 
and new business margins, among other things, and is 
amortised as insurance contract services are provided over 
time."
"The carrying amount of the LRC is – at the end of each 
reporting period – the sum of the present value of expected 
future net cash flows, the risk adjustment for non-financial 
risk and the contractual service margin."
"Cash flows (building block 1) 
The starting point for measuring groups of insurance 
contracts is based on a current estimate of all cash flows 
required to fulfil the contract within the contract boundary."
"Cash flows that need to be taken into account include 
premium payments, expenses for claims and benefits, 
acquisition and administration costs, and loss adjustment 
expenses."
"The cash flows included in the measurement 
model reflect our current estimates and expectations 
regarding the fulfilment of our insurance obligations at 
each reporting date."
"All cash inflows from the insurance 
contracts are included irrespective of the payment method, 
i.e."
also if they are received indirectly via an intermediary.
"We include in the cash flows an allocation of certain fixed 
and variable overheads that can be directly attributed to the 
fulfilment of insurance contracts."
"Consolidated financial statements 
165 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Discounting (building block 2) 
Under the GMM, future cash flows are discounted using 
current discount rates."
"Measurement thus considers the 
time value of money, so that cash flows expected to occur 
at different times are made comparable."
"In this context, we 
select discount rates that are as consistent as possible with 
the overall cash flow characteristics of the groups of 
insurance contracts, and make use of observable market 
inputs wherever possible."
"Discount rates are determined 
using a bottom-up approach, with the Solvency II interest-
rate curves published by the supervisory authority EIOPA 
(European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) 
serving as the starting point for risk-free interest rates."
"We 
ensure that credit spreads have no effect on the discounting 
of the cash flows or the risk adjustment for non-financial 
risk."
"The discount rates we use do not take into consideration 
any type of default risk."
"But if relevant, an illiquidity premium 
may be added to the discount-rate curve to take account of 
the differences in liquidity between the insurance liabilities 
and the liquid reference instruments used in determining 
the risk-free interest rate."
"We do this for the relevant 
portfolios in life primary insurance business, in particular."
"At each reporting date, the fulfilment cash flows for the 
LRC and LIC are remeasured using current discount rates."
"IFRS 17 provides for the option, applied at portfolio level,  
to recognise the impact of changes in discount rates and 
financial inputs in other comprehensive income rather  
than in the consolidated income statement."
"We make use 
of this option for the majority of our insurance portfolio, 
irrespective of the measurement model used."
"In the general 
measurement model, we present changes to the financial 
inputs in full in the liability for remaining coverage, excluding 
the loss component."
"Risk adjustment for non-financial risk (building block 3) 
Cash flows arising from insurance contracts usually involve 
a high degree of uncertainty regarding the point in time an 
insured event occurs and the amount of a claim."
"In addition, 
there may be changes to the assumptions made about the 
insurance business as a result of changes in policyholder 
behaviour, e.g."
related to exercising available options.
"To 
take this uncertainty into consideration, IFRS 17 provides 
for a third building block: an explicit risk adjustment for 
non-financial risk that represents compensation for bearing 
the risk."
"The sum of the risk adjustment for non-financial 
risk and the present value of net cash flows represents the 
fulfilment cash flows specific to a party that are relevant for 
measurement."
"The risk adjustment for non-financial risk is determined in 
accordance with our internal risk model, taking Group-wide 
risk diversification into account."
"We apply a cost-of-capital 
method for determining the risk adjustment for non-
financial risk."
"More specifically, we apply a cost-of-capital 
rate of 6% to the amount of capital required as at each 
future reporting date on a going-concern basis, and we 
discount the result using the risk-free rates adjusted for 
illiquidity."
"The level of risk adjustment for non-financial risk 
used by Munich Re corresponds to a confidence level of 
88% (87%) over a one-year period."
"Like the present value of 
the cash flows, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is 
reviewed at each reporting date and updated to reflect the 
current conditions."
"IFRS 17 provides for the option of splitting the change in 
risk adjustment for non-financial risk into insurance service 
result and insurance finance income or expenses."
"We 
report the full change in risk adjustment for non-financial 
risk as part of the insurance service result unless it is due  
to changes in the time value of money."
"Contractual service margin (building block 4) 
The contractual service margin represents the unearned 
profit at initial recognition that is spread over the coverage 
period as insurance contract services are provided."
"The initial 
recognition of profitable groups of insurance contracts thus 
does not affect profit or loss."
"If additional profitable contracts 
are added to a group of insurance contracts within an 
annual cohort over time, the expected profit from the new 
business is added to the contractual service margin at initial 
recognition."
"On subsequent measurement, the change in the 
contractual service margin is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement as part of insurance revenue."
"The 
amount of the contractual service margin to be recognised 
in profit or loss for each period is determined by coverage 
units."
"These are used to determine the quantity of services 
provided for the in-force insurance contracts in the current 
reporting period in relation to the expected total insurance 
contract services provided over the whole of the coverage 
period."
"For all of our insurance business, we define the 
coverage units in such a way as to ensure that they reflect 
the services provided as accurately as possible."
"We 
generally use volume-based coverage units such as the 
sum insured, which may be adjusted to reflect the specific 
characteristics of the (re)insurance business concerned."
"We recognise the 
expected loss in the consolidated income statement at 
initial recognition of the group of contracts, or as soon as 
we become aware that the group of insurance contracts is 
onerous."
"When aggregating insurance contracts into groups, 
we ensure that onerous insurance contracts are not combined 
with profitable ones."
"At subsequent measurement, our 
control procedures are also designed to identify at an early 
stage any groups of insurance contracts that are to be 
classified as onerous in terms of future coverage."
"A loss 
component will always reflect the expected loss from the 
insurance contract services still to be provided at a given 
point in time."
"We systematically amortise the loss component 
based on the remaining cash flows and the risk adjustment 
for non-financial risk until the end of the coverage period."
"An initially profitable group of insurance contracts within 
an annual cohort may become onerous on subsequent 
measurement."
"In this case, a loss component has to be 
recognised."
"Conversely, a group of insurance contracts 
classified as onerous can become profitable on subsequent 
measurement, giving rise to a contractual service margin."
"In both instances, the loss component and the contractual 
service margin have been completely amortised in profit or 
loss by the end of the coverage period."
"Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) 
 
Scope of application 
We use the PAA for all groups of insurance contracts  
that meet the requirements for applying the simplified 
measurement model."
"The length of the coverage period is mainly determined by 
the concept of contract boundaries."
"At present, we largely 
apply the PAA for our property-casualty reinsurance 
business."
"One exception relates to groups of insurance 
contracts for which the coverage period had expired at the 
transition date and which are in the settlement period."
"The 
GMM is applied to such groups of insurance contracts."
"While there was no valuation difference between the GMM 
and the PAA at the transition date, it was no longer 
possible to verify the applicability of the PAA to insurance 
contracts that were initially recognised in the distant past."
"In addition to our property-casualty reinsurance business, 
we generally also use the PAA for a substantial part of our 
property-casualty primary insurance business and for health 
primary insurance contracts not similar to life insurance."
"Procedure 
On initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts,  
we recognise an LRC, equal to the premiums received less 
acquisition costs paid."
"For business classified as profitable, 
neither the present value of the future net cash flows nor the 
risk adjustment for non-financial risk nor the contractual 
service margin is explicitly determined and recognised."
"If 
the coverage period of the contracts in the group is one year 
or less, any acquisition costs incurred may be recognised 
directly as an expense."
"We use this option for a substantial 
part of our property-casualty primary insurance business."
"Moreover, IFRS 17 provides for utilisation of the PAA to 
simplify the discounting of future cash flows when compared 
to the GMM."
"If there is no significant financing component 
and if claims settlement is expected within a year of the 
occurrence of loss, no discounting is required."
"We currently 
do not apply this option."
"In order to provide for maximum 
transparency and comparability in measuring our business, 
we consistently consider the time value of money also when 
using the PAA."
"If we are aware of any indications that contracts should be 
classified as onerous under the GMM, we compare the 
insurance liability determined under the PAA with the result 
of the measurement under the GMM."
"If the comparison 
shows that the carrying amount of the LRC (fulfilment  
cash flows) under the GMM exceeds the carrying amount 
determined under the PAA, we directly recognise the 
balance as an expense in the form of a loss component."
"To 
this end, we explicitly calculate the present value of the net 
cash flows and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk  
to facilitate a comparison with the GMM."
"Our onerosity 
testing is geared to identifying onerous contracts as soon 
as possible and ensures adequate reserving at all times."
"For subsequent measurement of a profitable group of 
insurance contracts, the carrying amount of the LRC is 
updated as follows."
"The LRC is 
reduced by the amount of insurance revenue earned as 
insurance contract services are provided."
"We earn the 
insurance revenue by spreading the expected total premium 
for the coverage period within the contract boundaries over 
the accounting periods in a risk-commensurate manner."
"Again, for subsequent measurement of profitable groups  
of insurance contracts, the present value of the net cash 
flows, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk and the 
contractual service margin are not explicitly determined, so 
that the PAA provides for effective simplification."
"By contrast 
and consistent with the GMM, we explicitly determine risk-
adjusted net cash flows for onerous groups of insurance 
contracts, and following the occurrence of an insured event."
"Consolidated financial statements 
167 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Also for the PAA, a distinction is made between the LRC 
and the LIC."
"Likewise, a risk adjustment for non-financial 
risk needs to be determined for the LIC when using the PAA."
"Contracts with direct participation features are chiefly 
measured using the VFA."
"Contracts fall within the VFA 
scope if they provide for policyholder participation in the 
performance of a reference value for the underlying items."
"This is the case for our German participating life and health 
primary insurance business and a substantial part of our 
international life and health primary insurance contracts."
"Unit-linked life insurance is another case for application of 
the VFA."
"However, both reinsurance contracts held and 
reinsurance contracts issued are excluded from the scope 
of this measurement approach."
"Procedure 
Because of the special characteristics of insurance 
contracts with direct participation features, we consider  
our share of the income from the underlying items to be  
a variable fee, which we recognise in accordance with the 
requirements of the VFA."
"This variable fee comprises our 
share of the fair value of the underlying items, and is our 
compensation for administering and managing them."
"While the initial measurement of participating contracts  
is the same as under the GMM, special rules apply under 
IFRS 17 for subsequent measurement."
"For example, we 
offset against the contractual service margin any and all 
effects that have an impact on the fair value of the 
underlying items and consequently on our variable fee."
"For German life and health (similar to life) primary insurance 
business, profit participation provides for policyholders 
essentially sharing in the investment result, risk result and 
cost result."
"The value of the underlying items is based on 
this profit participation, and reflects the present value of 
both future payments and payments made in current and 
prior periods."
"We use the fair values of the net assets covering 
our liabilities, including the assets covering equity, to 
measure the fair value of the underlying items."
"Because of  
the mechanics of German profit participation in particular, 
all financial and insurance effects and assumption changes 
have an impact on profit participation – and thus also on 
our variable fee."
"As a result, developments such as changes 
in the fair value of assets backing our liabilities, current loss 
experience, effects related to policyholder lapse behaviour 
and other changes in financial and non-financial assumptions 
are initially offset against the contractual service margin."
"The actual returns generated from the underlying items are 
usually higher, and the company’s share in any excess 
return over the risk-neutral measurement is included in the 
contractual service margin under the VFA."
"The recognition 
of the contractual service margin takes account of the 
effects resulting from the expected excess return from the 
performance of the underlying items attributable to the 
reporting period."
"This achieves the appropriate recognition 
of services provided under insurance contracts over the 
coverage period and accounts for the fact that the underlying 
items tend to generate higher returns than based on a risk-
neutral perspective."
"The assumptions regarding the expected 
excess return are based on requirements taken from 
corporate planning before the beginning of the financial year."
"For participating contracts, we take into account that we 
provide not only insurance services, but also investment-
related services in managing the assets backing our liabilities."
"Another difference compared with the GMM relates to the 
option of recognising the effect of changes in financial inputs 
on the measurement either in profit or loss in the consolidated 
income statement or directly in equity in other comprehensive 
income."
"This effect is not explicitly captured when using 
the VFA."
"Instead, because of the special link to the asset 
side, the result of the underlying item recognised in profit 
or loss for the liability side is mirrored in the consolidated 
income statement."
"A positive investment result is offset by 
corresponding finance expenses from insurance contracts 
issued."
"Changes in the fair value of assets that are part of 
the underlying items and do not have an impact on profit or 
loss are recognised as insurance finance income or 
expenses directly in other comprehensive income."
"This value 
corresponds to the amounts recognised for the investments 
in other comprehensive income plus off-balance-sheet 
valuation reserves."
"Consolidated financial statements

Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Foreign currency translation 
Our subsidiaries largely recognise differences resulting from 
the translation into their respective functional currencies in 
profit or loss."
"The thus converted net assets of foreign 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro are 
translated using the year-end exchange rates, and results 
using quarterly average exchange rates."
"Any exchange 
differences arising in the process are recognised in equity."
"For groups of insurance contracts that include cash flows 
in several currencies, we calculate the fulfilment cash 
flows, including the contractual service margin, in different 
currencies within the group."
"Changes in exchange rates  
for the different currencies result in an adjustment to the 
individual fulfilment cash flows at Group level, which is 
then translated into the functional currency of the Group 
company concerned."

Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Assets 
A Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill resulting from the first-time consolidation of 
subsidiaries is tested for impairment at least annually."
"We carry out additional impairment tests during the year  
if there are indications of impairment."
"For impairment testing, the goodwill is allocated to the cash-
generating units that derive benefit from the synergies of 
the business combinations."
"At the same time, the unit to 
which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal management 
purposes."
"Goodwill is allocated in reinsurance to divisions, 
and in primary insurance to the ERGO segment Property-
casualty Germany, and to legal entities."
"We regard amounts 
of 10% or more of total Group goodwill as significant."
"Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets largely include software assets, as 
well as acquired distribution networks and client bases."
"Software assets are carried at cost and are amortised on  
a straight-line basis over a useful life of three to five years."
"Amortisation is recognised in other operating expenses in 
the consolidated income statement."
"If necessary, impairment 
losses on the assets are recognised or reversed up to a 
maximum of the amortised cost."
"Client bases and distribution networks are carried at cost 
and are amortised on a straight-line basis over a useful life 
of eight to twenty years."
"If necessary, impairment losses are 
recognised or reversed up to a maximum of the amortised 
cost."
"Intangible assets related to our investments in infrastructure 
and renewable energies are reported separately under non-
financial investments."
"We refer to the notes in this chapter 
under D Investments > Non-financial investments."
"B Reinsurance contracts held that are assets 
The recognition and measurement of reinsurance contracts 
held generally follows the requirements for insurance 
contracts issued."
"For details, please refer to the information 
under Overarching accounting policies > Insurance 
contracts."
"Significant differences to the recognition and 
measurement requirements for insurance contracts issued 
are set out below."
"A group of reinsurance contracts held is recognised from 
the earlier of the following: 
− the beginning of the coverage period of the group of 
contracts, or 
− the date when an onerous group of underlying insurance 
contracts is recognised."
"We apply the PAA for most of our reinsurance contracts 
held in property-casualty business, and the GMM in life 
and health business."
"Conversely, the VFA is not applied to 
reinsurance contracts held."
"The estimates of future cash flows and their discounting 
are determined at the reporting date on the basis of current 
assumptions, which are in line with the assumptions we made 
for measuring the underlying insurance contracts issued."
"We determine the risk adjustment for non-financial risk of 
reinsurance contracts held as the proportion of the risks 
that is effectively transferred to the reinsurer, with the net 
risk capital after retrocession serving here as the basis."
"We 
ensure in this context the best possible consistency when 
determining the risk adjustment for non-financial risk as 
regards the underlying gross business."
"In contrast to insurance contracts issued, the contractual 
service margin for reinsurance contracts held can be positive 
or negative."
"Within this context, a positive contractual 
service margin is referred to as a net gain and a negative 
contractual service margin as a net cost."
"In the case of 
prospective reinsurance coverage, it is necessary upon 
purchasing reinsurance to defer both a net gain and a net 
cost over the coverage period."
"We offset against the 
contractual service margin any changes in the fulfilment 
cash flows, provided that the changes relate to future 
service."
"However, if the changes in estimates are attributable 
to changes that do not adjust the contractual service 
margin of the group of reinsured insurance contracts,  
we recognise their impact on the measurement of the 
reinsurance contract held in profit or loss."
"In this way,  
we achieve a consistent presentation of gross business  
and reinsurance contracts held."
"As part of subsequent 
measurement, the contractual service margin is spread  
out over the remaining coverage period on the basis of the 
coverage units."
"Conversely, an expected net gain is spread over the 
settlement period of the underlying contracts in a contractual 
service margin on the basis of coverage units."
"If a loss is recognised for an onerous group of underlying 
insurance contracts, we set up a loss-recovery component."
"In proportion to the anticipated recoveries, we thus match 
the loss component of the underlying gross business 
recognised as an expense with a loss-recovery component 
recognised as income."
"As a consequence, effective 
reinsurance coverage is thus offset in the financial statements 
and only the effects of losses from the underlying gross 
business that are not covered by reinsurance are recognised in 
profit or loss in the respective period."
"Reversals of the loss-
recovery component adjust the contractual service margin, 
provided that the reversals are not changes in the fulfilment 
cash flows of the group of reinsurance contracts held."
"The loss-recovery component is calculated by multiplying 
the recognised loss by the percentage of claims on the 
underlying insurance contracts that are expected to be 
recoverable."
"Upon subsequent measurement, the loss-
recovery component is adjusted to reflect the changes  
in the underlying loss component of the underlying 
insurance contracts."
"The loss-recovery component is of 
minor significance for Munich Re."
"C Insurance contracts issued that are assets 
Insurance contracts issued that are recognised as assets 
under the accounting policies are presented separately 
from the liabilities at a portfolio level in the consolidated 
balance sheet."
"The recognition and measurement of insurance contracts 
issued that are assets follows the same procedure as for 
insurance contracts issued that are liabilities."
"Please refer 
to the information found under Overarching accounting 
policies > Insurance contracts, and under Equity and 
liabilities > D Insurance contracts issued that are liabilities."
"D Investments 
Non-financial investments 
Investment properties are measured using the cost model 
or – if they are held as underlying items for insurance 
contracts with direct participation features under the VFA – 
in accordance with the fair value model."
"When measurement is based on the cost model, structural 
measures equivalent to 5% or more of the historical cost of 
a building are generally assessed with regard to whether 
they have to be capitalised."
"Buildings are depreciated on  
a straight-line basis in accordance with the component 
approach, depending on the weighted useful life for their 
specific building class."
"The underlying weighted-average 
useful life amounts to around 38 years."
"If the recoverable 
amount of land and buildings falls below their carrying 
amount, the carrying amount is written down to the 
recoverable amount."
"Maintenance expenses are recognised 
as an expense."
"If investment properties are held as underlying items for 
insurance contracts with direct participation features under 
the VFA, we recognise these properties at fair value."
"These 
properties cover underwriting liabilities whose amount  
is determined directly by the fair value of the properties."
"The properties are measured at cost, including incidental 
expenses, on initial recognition."
"Subsequent measurement is 
at fair value, recording any changes in value in the net result."
"The property, plant and equipment reported under non-
financial investments include, in particular, our investments 
in renewable energies and are measured at amortised cost."
"They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over a useful 
life of 20–30 years, but mostly over 20 years."
"Based on the 
annual impairment test, impairment losses are recognised 
or reversed up to a maximum of the amortised cost."
"Intangible assets related to our investments in infrastructure 
and renewable energies are generally accounted for as 
described in this chapter under A Intangible assets > Other 
intangible assets in the paragraph on client bases and 
distribution networks."
"These assets relate primarily to 
licences, concessions and right-of-use assets relating to the 
operation of investments in renewable energies."
"We report our forestry investments under biological 
assets."
"These investments are measured at fair value less 
costs of disposal, with impact on profit or loss."
"Investments in affiliated companies, associates and joint 
ventures that are not material for assessing the Group’s 
financial position are generally accounted for at fair value."
"We report any changes in the fair value in the consolidated 
income statement."
"For the consolidated financial statements, 
material investments in associates and joint ventures are 
measured using the equity method, i.e."
"with our share of 
their equity."
"Our share in the earnings is included in the 
investment result."
"As a rule, the equity and annual result 
from the most recent individual or consolidated financial  
 
 
Consolidated financial statements 
171 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
statements of the associate or joint venture are used."
"In the 
case of financial statements of important associates or joint 
ventures, appropriate adjustments are made to ensure they 
conform with Munich Re’s accounting policies, and significant 
transactions or other events are recognised in the same 
reporting period."
"Financial investments 
Financial investments make up the lion’s share of our 
financial assets."
"Their classification for the purposes of 
subsequent measurement is determined on the basis of the 
business model for managing the financial asset and the 
contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset."
"Financial investments are mostly used to back insurance 
liabilities and are managed as part of our asset-liability 
management on the basis of their duration and risk profile."
"This means that the management strategy is aimed at both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial 
assets."
"As a result, these financial investments are 
managed within the business model “hold to collect and 
sell”."
"If the investments managed within the business model 
“hold to collect and sell” pass the SPPI test, they are 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income."
"This is the case for the bulk of our financial 
investments."
"These investments include bonds and loans in 
particular."
"By contrast, bonds and loans that do not pass the SPPI test 
are measured at fair value through profit or loss just like 
equities, investment fund units and derivatives."
"Deposits with banks are managed within the business 
model “hold to collect” and pass the SPPI test, meaning 
that they are measured at amortised cost."
"For further 
details on the classification and measurement of financial 
investments, including impairment, please refer to 
Overarching accounting policies > Financial instruments."
"The section below summarises the significant 
accounting policies for those financial instruments reported 
in accordance with IAS 39 in the comparative period."
"In addition to the first-time application of IFRS 9, changes 
were made to the presentation and classification of items in 
the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with IAS 1.41."
"This means that the IAS 39 measurement categories set 
out below no longer match the line items."
"For details, 
please refer to the section entitled “Changes in accounting 
policies and other adjustments”."
"Under IAS 39, loans are non-derivative financial assets 
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market."
"They were measured at amortised cost in 
accordance with the effective interest method."
"Unrealised gains or losses were calculated 
taking into account interest accrued and, after deduction  
of deferred taxes, were recognised directly in equity under 
“Other reserves”."
"Securities measured at fair value through profit or loss 
under IAS 39 comprise securities held for trading and 
securities classified as “measured at fair value through 
profit or loss”."
"At Munich Re, securities held for trading 
mainly included all derivative financial instruments with 
positive fair values which we have acquired to manage  
and hedge risks but which do not meet the requirements  
of IAS 39 for hedge accounting."
"The securities that were 
designated as “at fair value through profit or loss” under 
IAS 39 included embedded derivatives that had to be 
separated."
"In addition, loan portfolios were managed based 
on the fair value of the entire portfolio, which is why it was 
designated as “measured at fair value through profit or loss”."
"Investments for unit-linked life insurance contracts were also 
measured at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39."
"Similarly, other insurance-related financial instruments 
were largely measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Deposits with banks were measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, and cash and cash 
equivalents were carried at their nominal value."
"Regular 
income and expenses from investments not measured at 
fair value through profit or loss were calculated in accordance 
with the effective interest method."
"Under the IAS 39 rules, we assessed at each reporting date 
whether there was any substantial objective evidence of 
impairment in a financial asset or group of financial assets."
"On the basis of these test results, a list of 
investments was prepared for which an impairment must  
be recognised; this list was then verified once again with 
the involvement of management."
"IAS 39.59 contains a list providing objective evidence of 
impairment of financial assets."
"In addition, IAS 39.61 states 
that, for equity investments, a significant or prolonged decline 
in the fair value of the investment below its acquisition cost 
is objective evidence of impairment."
"These rules were given 
more concrete form by means of internal guidelines."
"For 
equities quoted on the stock exchange, we assumed a 
significant decline in fair value if the market value at the 
review date was at least 20% below the average purchase 
price, or had been lower than this amount for at least six 
months."
"In the case of fixed-interest securities and loans, 
the main basis for establishing impairment was an indication 
of substantial financial difficulty on the part of the issuer, 
the current market situation or media reports on the issuer."
"There are no differences between IFRS 9 and IAS 39 
regarding the recognition and offsetting of financial 
instruments, or repurchase agreements and securities 
lending."
"The accounting policies for financial liabilities under IAS 39 
match those under IFRS 9 except that, if the fair value 
option is applied, value changes attributable to a change  
in the entity’s own credit risk are not recognised in other 
comprehensive income under IAS 39."
"E Investments for unit-linked life insurance 
Investments for unit-linked life insurance are managed 
within the business model “other”, meaning they are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"For further details on classification and measurement and 
other overarching accounting policies, please refer to 
Overarching accounting policies > Financial instruments."
"F Insurance-related financial instruments 
Insurance-related financial instruments are not utilised for 
asset-liability management."
"Instead, they are managed based 
on their fair value within the business model “other”, meaning 
they are measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"In particular, insurance-related financial instruments include 
insurance derivatives, derivative components of variable 
annuities, derivatives for hedging variable annuity contracts 
and loans."
"In the case of loans, contractual wording largely 
waives the right to reimbursement triggered by the 
occurrence of insurance events."
"The item also includes 
financial instruments directly linked to insurance business 
that are similar in nature to equity instruments."
"Insurance-
linked derivatives include retrocessions in the form of 
derivatives, individually structured insurance-linked 
derivatives and derivative components which are separated 
from their host insurance contract."
"Insurance-related 
financial instruments also include insurance contracts that 
do not transfer significant insurance risk."
"For further details on classification and measurement and 
other overarching accounting policies, please refer to 
Overarching accounting policies > Financial instruments."
"G Receivables 
The receivables included in this item comprise current tax 
receivables, financial receivables and other receivables."
"Current tax receivables are accounted for in accordance 
with local tax regulations and other receivables at 
amortised cost."
"Current tax receivables comprise current 
taxes on income of the individual companies, based on their 
respective national taxation."
"Other tax receivables are shown 
under “Other receivables”."
"Consolidated financial statements 
173 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
The financial receivables are financial instruments."
"As they 
are managed within the business model “hold to collect”, 
they are measured at amortised cost provided they pass  
the SPPI test."
"In such cases, they are subject to the IFRS 9 
impairment model."
"Otherwise, they are subsequently 
measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"For further 
details on classification and measurement and other 
overarching accounting policies, please refer to Overarching 
accounting policies > Financial instruments."
"The impairment test of our non-financial receivables that 
are not carried at fair value in subsequent periods is 
performed in a two-stage process, firstly at the level of 
individual items, and then on the basis of groups of similar 
receivables."
The impairment is recognised as an expense.
"If, in a subsequent period, the reasons for the impairment 
cease to apply, the impairment is reversed, with impact on 
the income statement."
"The resultant carrying amount may 
not exceed the cost."
"H Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments and 
are managed within the business model “hold to collect”."
"As a result, they are measured at amortised cost, or at their 
nominal value due to their short-term nature."
"If they do not 
pass the SPPI test, they are measured at fair value through 
profit or loss."
"For further details on classification and 
measurement and other overarching accounting policies, 
please refer to Overarching accounting policies > Financial 
instruments."
"Also included are 
tax assets deriving from tax loss carry-forwards."
"Deferred 
tax assets are recognised if there are sufficient taxable 
temporary differences which are expected to reverse in the 
same period as the deductible temporary differences."
"For 
any additional deductible temporary differences, deferred 
tax assets are only recognised if it is considered probable 
that future profits will be available in the same period in 
which the deductible temporary differences are expected to 
reverse."
"As a rule, a five-year forecast period is considered."
"We take into account the tax rates of the countries 
concerned and the consolidated company’s respective tax 
situation; in some cases, for purposes of simplification,  
we use uniform tax rates for individual circumstances or 
subsidiaries."
"Changes in tax rates and tax legislation that 
have already been adopted by the government at the 
balance sheet date are taken into account."
"Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are reported 
on a net basis, provided that they refer to the same taxable 
entity and the same tax authority."
"Netting out is done here 
if it is generally possible to offset the underlying tax assets 
and tax liabilities."
"J 
Other assets 
Other assets mainly include property, plant and equipment 
not related to our investments in infrastructure and renewable 
energies (in particular owner-occupied property) and are 
generally measured at amortised cost (cost model)."
"Depreciations mainly occur on a straight-line basis; the 
weighted-average useful life of the owner-occupied buildings 
is about 44 years."
"Impairment losses are recognised for 
owner-occupied land and buildings, operating and office 
equipment accounted for using the cost model if the 
recoverable amount has fallen below the carrying amount 
on the reporting date."
"If necessary, impairment losses are 
reversed up to a maximum of the amortised cost."
"If owner-occupied land and buildings are held as underlying 
items for insurance contracts with direct participation 
features under the VFA, we recognise these using the fair 
value model."
"They are measured at cost, including incidental 
expenses, on initial recognition."
"Subsequent measurement is 
at fair value, recording any changes in value in the net result."
Right-of-use assets are also reported under other assets.
"These comprise lease liabilities, lease payments made  
at the time or before the asset is made available for use, 
initial direct costs, and restoration obligations."
"Right-of-use 
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease."
"K Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets held for sale are assets that can be sold 
in their current condition and whose sale is highly probable."
The item may comprise individual assets or groups of assets.
"Non-current assets held for sale are recognised at the lower 
of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell."
"They 
are no longer depreciated."
"Measurement of financial 
instruments remains unchanged; the only difference is how 
they are disclosed."
"Under Retained earnings, we show the profits which 
consolidated companies have earned and retained  
since becoming part of Munich Re."
"In addition, the 
adjustment amount resulting from changes in accounting 
policies for earlier periods not included in the consolidated 
financial statements is recognised in the opening balance 
of the retained earnings for the earliest prior period 
reported."
"Retained earnings also include the effects from 
remeasurement of defined benefit plans."
Own shares are deducted from equity.
"The purchase, sale 
or retirement of these shares is recognised in equity items, 
without impact on profit or loss."
"We use the item Other reserves to report unrealised gains 
and losses resulting from the measurement of financial 
investments at fair value through other comprehensive 
income."
"In addition, they include unrealised gains and losses 
from the measurement of associates and joint ventures using 
the equity method."
"We report insurance finance income or 
expenses for the majority of our insurance portfolio in 
“Other reserves”, under the changes from the measurement 
of insurance contracts."
"This is to recognise the impact of 
changes in discount rates and other financial inputs."
"Differences resulting from the currency translation of foreign 
subsidiaries’ figures, and remeasurement gains/losses 
from hedging relationships are also presented under “Other 
reserves”."
"IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 17, Insurance 
Contracts, were applied for the first time with effect from 
1 January 2023."
"Effects from the initial application of 
IFRS 17 are recognised in equity as at 1 January 2022, with 
effects from the initial application of IFRS 9 recognised in 
equity as at 1 January 2023."
"For further details on the impact 
of the initial application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, please refer 
to the information under “Changes in accounting policies 
and other adjustments” and under Explanatory information 
> Notes to the consolidated balance sheet – Equity and 
liabilities > 24 Equity."
"B Subordinated liabilities 
Subordinated liabilities are liabilities which, in the event of 
liquidation or insolvency, are only satisfied after the claims 
of other creditors."
"They are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method."
"For further details on classification and measurement and 
other overarching accounting policies, please refer to 
Overarching accounting policies > Financial instruments."
"C Reinsurance contracts held that are 
liabilities 
Reinsurance contracts held that are recognised as liabilities 
due to application of the accounting policies are presented 
separately from the assets at a portfolio level in the 
consolidated balance sheet."
"The recognition and measurement of reinsurance contracts 
held that are liabilities follows the same procedure as for 
reinsurance contracts held that are assets."
"Please refer to 
the information under Assets > B Reinsurance contracts held 
that are assets."
"D Insurance contracts issued that are 
liabilities 
In the case of insurance contracts issued that are liabilities, 
we present the following items separately in the consolidated 
balance sheet: the LRC, the LIC, and other technical 
liabilities."
"The section below describes how the individual 
items are reported based on the various measurement 
models."
"The general accounting policies for insurance 
contracts issued that are liabilities are set out in Overarching 
accounting policies > Insurance contracts."
"Liability for remaining coverage 
The LRC comprises the payment obligations for insured 
events that have not yet occurred and for other insurance 
contract services that have not yet been provided."
"Under 
the GMM, the LRC is the sum of the present value of the 
risk-adjusted future cash flows (fulfilment cash flows – 
consisting of building blocks 1, 2 and 3) and the contractual 
service margin (building block 4)."
"For detailed explanations 
of the building blocks and their measurement, please refer 
to Overarching accounting policies > Insurance contracts."
"We remeasure the estimated present value of the future 
cash flows and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk at 
each reporting date on the basis of updated assumptions."
"In addition, we recognise the expected profit attributable to 
the provision of insurance coverage for a group of insurance 
contracts as a contractual service margin, and thus explicitly 
as part of the liability for remaining coverage."
"We adjust the 
contractual service margin for any changes in fulfilment 
cash flows relating to future services, or establish a loss 
component and recognise it as an expense as soon as the 
contractual service margin has been depleted."
"In other words, neither the present 
value of the future cash flows nor a risk adjustment for 
non-financial risk nor a contractual service margin is 
determined."
"Conversely, in the case of onerous groups of 
insurance contracts a loss component is recognised in line 
with the GMM and recognised under this balance sheet 
item."
"As part of subsequent measurement, we consider the 
time value of money and consequently achieve the greatest 
possible consistency with the application of the GMM."
"The 
liability for remaining coverage is adjusted on the basis of 
historical yield curves as determined on initial recognition."
"The LRC for groups of insurance contracts measured under 
the VFA consists of the sum of the present value of the 
risk-adjusted future cash flows and the contractual service 
margin."
"The determination of both the present value of  
the future cash flows and the risk adjustment for non-
financial risk at initial measurement generally follows the 
requirements under the GMM."
"Special rules apply under 
IFRS 17 for subsequent measurement as per the VFA; 
please refer to Overarching accounting policies > Insurance 
contracts."
"Liability for incurred claims 
The LIC comprises the payment obligations for incurred 
claims that have not yet been settled, and for other 
insurance contract services already provided."
"It is measured 
by applying the first three building blocks of the GMM, i.e."
"by calculating the present value of the risk-adjusted future 
cash flows."
"We start by determining, based on our actuarial 
estimate, the requisite present value of the cash outflows 
expected to occur by the time the insured event has been 
definitively settled."
"The present value of the cash outflows 
reflects both the expected payments to the policyholder as 
well as our claims settlement expenses and administration 
costs."
"We add a risk adjustment for non-financial risk to 
the present value of the cash outflows to account for any 
remaining uncertainty as to the ultimate amount of claims 
or their payout dates."
"In the context of estimates and in line with the LRC, we 
consider past experience and assumptions about future 
developments, including social, economic or technological 
factors."
"By applying our actuarial projection methods,  
we ensure appropriate reserving for incurred claims at all 
times, near the upper end of adequate expected values."
"We use current discount rates when discounting future 
risk-adjusted cash outflows and use the option to recognise 
the effect of changes in financial inputs on measurement in 
""Other comprehensive income” in equity."
"When determining 
the fulfilment cash flows for the liability for incurred claims 
using the general measurement model and when using the 
PAA, we use the discount rates at the date of the incurred 
claim."
"However, we base subsequent measurement on 
different discount rates depending on the measurement 
model used."
"Under the general measurement model, 
changes to the financial inputs for the liability for incurred 
claims compared to the ones used at initial recognition of 
the liability for remaining coverage are presented in “Other 
comprehensive income”."
"Under the PAA, changes to the 
financial inputs for the liability for incurred claims compared 
to the ones used at initial recognition of the liability for 
incurred claims are presented in “Other comprehensive 
income”."
"When applying the PAA, we do not make use of 
the option to refrain from discounting under certain 
circumstances."
"The date of loss needs to be estimated 
because cedants use aggregated claims data."
"We have 
prepared these estimates on a quarterly basis since 2023 
(2022: annual basis)."
"Changes in the measurement of the LIC arising from 
updated actuarial estimates or updated costs are recognised 
in profit or loss."
"Particularly for participating life and health primary insurance 
business, the LIC primarily concerns payments to customers."
"We do not distinguish in our balance sheet presentation of 
technical liabilities between unit-linked life insurance 
contracts and other insurance contracts in the VFA scope."
"Other technical liabilities 
Under the balance sheet item “Other technical liabilities” 
we present measurement components regarding groups of 
insurance contracts for which the recognition criteria have 
not yet been met."
"This mainly includes premiums received 
before the first payment due date and the beginning of the 
coverage period."
"E Other provisions 
This item includes Provisions for post-employment 
benefits and similar obligations."
"Under defined 
contribution plans, the companies pay fixed contributions 
to an insurer or a pension fund."
"This fully covers the 
companies’ obligations."
"Under defined benefit plans, the 
staff member is promised a particular level of retirement  
 
 
Consolidated financial statements

benefit either by companies or by pension funds."
"The 
companies’ contributions needed to finance this are not 
fixed in advance."
"If pension obligations are covered by 
assets held by a legally separate entity (e.g."
"a fund or a 
contractual trust arrangement in the form of a two-way 
trust) – assets that may only be used to cover the pension 
commitments given and are not accessible to creditors – 
the pension obligations are shown less the amount of these 
plan assets."
"If the fair value of the assets exceeds the related 
outsourced pension commitments, this reimbursement 
right must be recognised and is presented under “Other 
receivables”."
"Pension obligations are recognised in accordance with 
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, using the projected unit credit 
method."
"The calculation includes not only the pension 
entitlements and current pensions known at the end of the 
reporting period, but also their expected future development."
"The assumptions for the future development are determined 
on the basis of the circumstances in the individual countries."
"The discount rate applied to the pension obligations is 
based on the yields for long-term, high-quality corporate 
bonds."
"The item also includes miscellaneous provisions, which  
we establish in the amount of the probable requirement."
"Such amounts are not discounted if the interest-rate effect 
is insignificant."
"F Liabilities 
Liabilities include derivatives, non-derivative financial 
liabilities, current tax liabilities and other liabilities."
"The derivatives, non-derivative financial liabilities and the 
bulk of other liabilities are financial instruments."
"The latter 
include insurance-related liabilities."
"The general accounting 
policies for financial liabilities are set out in Overarching 
accounting policies > Financial instruments."
"Lease liabilities are included in “Non-derivative financial 
liabilities”."
"The lease liability represents the present value  
of the payment obligations entered into."
"As a rule, lease 
payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing 
rate."
"Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate  
on which the lease is based, provided that this rate can be 
determined."
"Current tax liabilities comprise current taxes on income  
of the individual companies, based on their respective 
national taxation."
"Other tax liabilities are shown under 
“Other liabilities”."
"H Liabilities related to non-current assets 
held for sale 
Liabilities to be transferred together with disposal groups 
are recognised in this item, see Assets > K Non-current 
assets held for sale."
"Consolidated income statement 
A Insurance service result 
Insurance revenue is defined so as to facilitate comparisons 
with revenue in other industries; it also distinguishes between 
various sources of revenue with respect to the GMM and 
the VFA."
"Insurance revenue is the consideration we are 
expected to receive for the insurance contract services we 
provide; investment components are excluded from 
insurance revenue."
"An investment component is the amount 
that an insurance contract requires us to repay to the 
policyholder in all circumstances – regardless of whether 
an insured event occurs, e.g."
"either as a claims payment or 
as a participation in profit."
"An investment component is not 
recognised as insurance revenue and also the repayment of 
this amount is recognised with no impact on profit or loss."
"Particularly surrender values in primary insurance as well 
as performance-related or fixed commissions and profit 
commissions in reinsurance are investment components  
in our business, provided that we first receive the premium 
before such repayments are made to the policyholder."
"Excluding investment components from insurance revenue 
does not affect the insurance service result, as there are 
corresponding reductions in the insurance service expenses."
"We allocate the expected premium receipts  
to each period on the basis of the expected pattern of 
release of risk during the coverage period."
"The insurance service expenses comprise claims expenses 
in particular (without repayment of any investment 
components)."
"We present administration and acquisition 
costs separately under “Insurance service expenses” in  
the consolidated income statement."
"Acquisition costs are 
recognised in insurance service expenses in the same 
amount as used to determine insurance revenue based on 
systematic allocation to the appropriate periods of the 
coverage period."
"We furthermore present changes in  
the underlying items separately under “Insurance service 
expenses” when applying the VFA."
"B Result from insurance-related financial 
instruments 
The result from insurance-related financial instruments 
includes regular income and expenses, changes in the fair 
value of financial instruments, expenses for the management 
of investments and other income and expenses."
"Regular income and expenses 
from financial investments not measured at fair value through 
profit or loss are calculated using the effective interest 
method, i.e."
"any premiums or discounts are amortised over 
the period of maturity, with impact on profit or loss."
"The interest revenue recognised separately in the 
consolidated income statement relates to our financial assets 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
and is calculated using the effective interest method."
"D Investment result for unit-linked life 
insurance 
The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of 
investments for unit-linked life insurance are included in 
the investment result for unit-linked life insurance."
"They are 
matched by corresponding changes from the measurement 
of the LRC for unit-linked life insurance that are included in 
insurance finance income or expenses."
"E Insurance finance income or expenses 
Insurance finance income or expenses include the effect 
from the accretion of interest on the present value of the 
net cash flows, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk 
and the contractual service margin."
"Conversely, we 
recognise the impact of changes in interest rates in “Other 
comprehensive income” in equity for the majority of our 
insurance portfolio."
"Changes in accounting policies and other 
adjustments 
Standards to be applied for the first time 
The application of recognition, measurement and 
disclosure methods generally follows the principle of 
consistency."
"We apply 
IFRS 9, including all amendments incorporated into 
EU law by 31 December 2022."
"We apply IFRS 17, 
including all amendments incorporated into EU law by 
31 December 2022."

IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 have led to significant changes in the 
classification and measurement of financial instruments 
and in the recognition, measurement and presentation of 
insurance contracts."
"Moreover, the adoption of these 
standards has far-reaching implications for the disclosures 
in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) has published model rules on  
Pillar Two – Global Minimum Tax."
"These are being 
transposed into local tax law in some of the countries 
where Munich Re does business."
"Munich Re observes and 
complies with the legal changes."
"These regulations have 
already been implemented in Germany and entered into 
force on 1 January 2024."
"Due to the new requirements of 
global minimum taxation, the IASB adopted amendments 
to IAS 12 in May 2023, including a mandatory exemption 
from the obligation to recognise deferred tax assets and 
liabilities in connection with Pillar Two."
"The additional amendments to existing standards listed 
above have no effect or no material effect on Munich Re."
"A more detailed explanation of the effects from the initial 
application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 follows below."
"For a 
general summary of the accounting policies applied, please 
refer to “Overarching accounting policies”."
"Effects from the initial application of IFRS 9 
Retrospective application and comparative information 
We have applied the requirements of IFRS 9 for the 
classification and measurement of financial instruments 
retrospectively as of 1 January 2023."
"Initial application is 
made in accordance with the transition requirements of 
IFRS 9."
"As a general principle, we use the option not to restate 
comparative information, but continue to present it in 
accordance with IAS 39."
"However, in connection with the 
initial application of IFRS 17, we make use of the classification 
overlay approach for certain financial instruments 
(especially loans) in order to avoid accounting mismatches 
when transitioning to IFRS 17."
"This approach allows us  
to present comparative information for these financial  
instruments as if the classification and measurement 
requirements of IFRS 9 had already been applied."
"When 
applying the classification overlay approach, we do not 
make use of the concept for recognising expected credit 
losses under IFRS 9."
"Further comments can be found in 
this section under Effects from the initial application of 
IFRS 17 > Comparative information."
"Classification and measurement of financial 
instruments 
The classification of financial assets is based on the 
business model under which the financial assets are 
managed and on the “solely payments of principal and 
interest” (SPPI) criteria."
"Our financial assets will mainly be measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income, particularly bonds 
and loans that are managed within the business model 
“hold to collect and sell” and also pass the SPPI test."
"In 
contrast to IAS 39, under IFRS 9 a higher overall percentage 
of our financial assets will be measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income."
"There is a lower proportion of financial assets measured  
at amortised cost (AC) and a higher percentage of financial 
assets measured at fair value through profit or loss than 
under IAS 39 measurement."
"Financial assets measured at 
fair value through profit or loss include, in particular, fixed-
interest securities and loans that do not pass the SPPI test, 
equities, investment fund units, and derivatives."
"Reclassification from the IAS 39 category of “available for 
sale” (AfS) to the IFRS 9 classification of “at fair value through 
profit or loss” (FVPL) involves primarily participations and 
shares."
"This reclassification also affects insurance-related 
bonds and equity instruments."
"We do not exercise the 
option to designate equity instruments as measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income."
"Under IFRS 9, they  
no longer meet the requirements for applying the fair value 
option."
"Where the bonds pass the SPPI test, they are 
classified as “at fair value through other comprehensive 
income”."
"IFRS 9 does not provide for any material changes to the 
classification requirements for financial liabilities."
"Most of 
our financial liabilities continue to be measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method."
"Before the initial 
application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, the liabilities related to 
insurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance 
risk were measured at amortised cost."
"Under IFRS 9, these  
contracts are considered financial instruments; they are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, exercising the 
fair value option."
"In addition, loan commitments that have 
thus far been accounted for in accordance with IAS 37 are 
now classified as “at fair value through profit or loss” provided 
the financial instruments added later are accounted for at 
fair value."
"The following table presents the reconciliation of 
measurement categories from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 for financial 
assets and the impact on retained earnings following 
reclassification and/or remeasurement."
"The carrying 
amounts as at 31 December 2022 include corresponding 
remeasurement effects anticipated during application of 
the classification overlay approach."
"Additional information 
on the classification overlay approach can be found under 
Basis of preparation > Comparative information, and in this 
chapter under Effects from the initial application of IFRS 17 
> Measurement at the transition date."
"With the entry into force of IFRS 9, such 
instruments are accounted for on a uniform basis."
"For the sake of simplicity, we therefore present embedded derivatives that need to be accounted for separately under 
IAS 39 together with the host contract in the “Previous year” column of the reconciliation table."
"2 
For certain insurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk, financial assets and liabilities were recognised prior to the initial application of IFRS 9."
"For 
the sake of clarity, the effects from the transition to IFRS 9 for these contracts are presented on a combined basis in the reconciliation table."
"The following table presents the reconciliation of 
measurement categories from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 for 
financial liabilities."
"For 
the sake of clarity, the effects from the transition to IFRS 9 for these contracts are presented on a combined basis in the reconciliation table."
"The following table contains information on the fair values 
of, and unrecognised fair value gains/losses on, financial 
instruments which, in the context of the initial application 
of IFRS 9, were reclassified from the IAS 39 category of  
“at fair value through profit or loss” (FVPL)."
"There were no 
reclassifications from the category “available for sale”."
"The model is applied to recognise impairment losses on 
financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value 
through other comprehensive income, as well as on lease 
receivables."
"The following table shows the reconciliation of impairment 
losses under IAS 39 to loss allowances under IFRS 9."
"Impact on equity 
The new requirements for classifying financial assets and 
financial liabilities have overall led to a reduction in equity 
by €440m as at 1 January 2023."
"However, most of the 
classification effect on equity had already been anticipated 
by applying the classification overlay approach in 
connection with the initial application of IFRS 17."
"Additional information on the 
classification overlay approach can be found under Basis  
of preparation > Comparative information, and in this 
chapter under Effects from the initial application of IFRS 17 
> Measurement at the transition date."
"The effects on “Retained earnings” amounted to €1,155m in 
total and are presented in the above tables showing the 
reconciliation of measurement categories from IAS 39 to 
IFRS 9."
"By contrast, “Other reserves” were reduced by €1,595m."
"However, this decline was largely attributable to the new 
classification requirements for financial assets, which led to 
reclassifications within equity between “Retained earnings” 
and “Other reserves”."
"The initial application of the impairment requirements 
under the expected credit loss model as at 1 January 2023 
resulted in a slight decrease in equity by €1m."
"This decrease 
is minor primarily because just a very small proportion of 
financial assets are measured at amortised cost under 
IFRS 9; moreover, these assets are generally of high credit 
quality."
"The vast majority of financial assets are measured 
at fair value through other comprehensive income; any 
change in value including a change in loss allowance is 
recognised under “Other reserves” in equity."
"Accordingly, 
the additional recognition of expected credit losses on the 
above-mentioned financial assets as at the transition date 
merely resulted in a reclassification of €178m from 
“Retained earnings” to “Other reserves” within equity."
"The initial application of IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2023 had 
no material impact on earnings per share."
"Effects from the initial application of IFRS 17 
Measurement at the transition date 
We apply IFRS 17 retrospectively with effect from 1 January 
2023 unless this is impracticable."
"Initial application is 
made in accordance with the transition requirements of 
IFRS 17."
"Depending on the availability of the information 
required, we use one of the following three transition 
approaches for the initial application of IFRS 17 to our in-
force business."
"We apply the full retrospective approach to remeasure 
insurance contracts to the extent that this was practicable 
based on the information available as at the transition date."
"To this end, we identify and measure groups of contracts  
as if IFRS 17 had always been applied, without making use 
of transition simplifications."
"The information used for the 
full retrospective approach is primarily based on existing 
regular processes and internal reporting."
"Where it was impracticable to apply the full retrospective 
approach, i.e."
"The aim of the modified retrospective approach is to 
achieve the outcome that is as close as possible to the full 
retrospective approach using reasonable and supportable 
information."
"Under the modified retrospective approach, we 
use the simplifications and modifications specified in the 
standard only to the extent that the information required for 
a full retrospective approach is not available without undue 
cost or effort."
"In particular, this applies to simplifications 
used in identifying and classifying groups of insurance 
contracts, determining the contractual service margin or 
the loss component, and determining insurance finance 
income or expenses."
"In life reinsurance, if the available historical information is 
insufficient to use the full retrospective approach, we mostly 
use the fair value approach to measure our insurance 
contracts, aiming to ensure market consistency as much as 
possible."
"Among other things, we rely on 
market analyses to validate the cost of capital used."
"In terms 
of the net insurance liabilities as at the transition date, the 
modified retrospective approach and the fair value approach 
make up over 90%."
"However, restatements are necessary for  
 
 
Consolidated financial statements 
184 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
those items which are included in the measurement of 
insurance items under IFRS 17."
"This affects in particular 
deposits retained as well as accounts receivable and 
payable on reinsurance business."
"In addition, we apply the 
classification overlay approach for some of our financial 
instruments in order to avoid accounting mismatches  
when transitioning to IFRS 17."
"This approach allows us to 
measure certain financial instruments for the 2022 
comparative period in the 2023 consolidated financial 
statements as if the measurement rules of IFRS 9 had 
already been applied."
"We made use of this option for 
financial instruments which back primary insurance 
business with direct participation features within the scope 
of the VFA, and which have previously been accounted for 
at amortised cost."
"When applying the 
classification overlay approach, we do not make use of  
the concept for recognising expected credit losses under 
IFRS 9."
"In connection with the initial application of IFRS 17 as at 
1 January 2023, we also measure property held as underlying 
items for insurance contracts with direct participation 
features under the VFA in accordance with the fair value 
model."
"This approach likewise serves to avoid accounting 
mismatches."
"The comparative information has been restated 
accordingly."
"The effects of the classification overlay 
approach and the effects of discounting have a contrary 
impact."
"As a component of insurance contracts issued and held 
that are assets or liabilities, the contractual service margin 
reflects the unearned profits at initial recognition and is 
recognised in profit or loss over time as insurance contract 
services are provided."
"At €22.3bn, the contractual service 
margin clearly exceeded the overall decrease in equity 
resulting from the initial application of IFRS 17 as at 
1 January 2022."
"In particular, our life reinsurance business 
and our life and health primary insurance business contribute 
to the amount of the contractual service margin."
"It should 
be noted that insurance contracts that are accounted for 
using the PAA do not include a contractual service margin 
under IFRS 17."
"The risk adjustment for non-financial risk is taken into 
account in the measurement of insurance contracts."
"We 
base the risk adjustment for non-financial risk on the risk 
capital requirements of our internal risk model."
"The risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk is closely aligned with  
the calculation of the non-financial risk in accordance with 
Solvency II."
"Solvency II requires the value at risk of basic  
 
 
Consolidated financial statements 
185 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
own funds to be calculated with a confidence level of 
99.5% over a one-year period."
"The level of risk adjustment 
for non-financial risk used by Munich Re corresponds to a 
confidence level of approximately 90% (at the time of 
transition) over a one-year period."
"The risk adjustment for 
non-financial risk is lower in this instance than the risk 
margin under Solvency II as at 31 December 2021."
"This is 
due to the fact that – unlike in the calculation of the risk 
margin – the Group-wide risk diversification is included in 
the calculation of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk."
"To determine the risk adjustment for non-
financial risk, we applied a cost-of-capital method with  
a cost-of-capital rate of 6%, in the same way as we do 
under Solvency II."
"The loss component reduces equity and reflects the 
expected loss from services still to be provided under 
insurance contracts issued."
"It is amortised over the coverage 
period."
"The loss 
component can balance out over time and contribute to 
run-off profits."
"In addition to the above-mentioned effects on equity as at 
1 January 2022, initial application of IFRS 17 had the 
following impacts on the result for the 2022 financial year: 
Initial application of IFRS 17 resulted in an increase in the 
result for the 2022 financial year amounting to €1.9bn."
"The result under IFRS 17 was affected by the interest-rate 
levels as at the transition date 1 January 2022 and by the 
interest-rate developments in 2022."
"Due to the comparatively 
very low interest-rate levels as at 1 January 2022 there 
were minor unwinding-of-discount effects on the insurance 
portfolio overall."
"By contrast, losses that occurred in the 
2022 financial year were discounted at higher discount rates 
for the 2022 accident year as a result of the substantial rise 
in interest rates over the course of 2022."
"This mainly 
affected the property-casualty reinsurance segment and – 
including the positive effect from the primarily interest-
rate-induced reduction in the loss component in the 2022 
financial year – had a positive effect of around €1.5bn on 
the result for the 2022 financial year."
"The services we rendered in the comparative period and the 
associated recognition in profit or loss of the contractual 
service margin resulted in an earlier recognition of profits in 
life reinsurance than under IFRS 4."
"Insurance revenue is considerably lower than gross 
premiums written because amounts that are repaid to 
policyholders under all circumstances, regardless of 
whether an insured event occurs (investment components), 
are not recognised as insurance revenue under IFRS 17."
"This relates in particular to commissions and profit 
commissions in reinsurance business."
"The reduction in 
revenue does not affect the insurance service result, as the 
insurance service expenses are likewise reduced."
"The cumulative amounts contained in other comprehensive 
income from insurance contracts measured as at the 
transition date by applying the modified retrospective and 
fair value approaches came to €450m."
"At the end of the 
financial year, these amounts stood at −€1,165m (−€1,885m)."
"The cumulative amounts contained in other comprehensive 
income from investments measured at fair value that are 
essentially to be allocated to the insurance contracts 
mentioned above came to €3,741m."
"At the end of the 
financial year, these amounts stood at −€2,569m (−€3,604m)."
"The cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income 
relating to financial assets include all changes arising from 
additions and disposals of financial assets in the financial 
year and at the end of the previous year."
"The transition to IFRS 17 has not affected the economic 
opportunities and risks of the insurance business for 
Munich Re as such."
"Detailed information about this can be 
found in our 2022 Solvency and Financial Condition Report 
(SFCR)."
"In the consolidated income statement, IFRS 17 requires a 
disaggregation between the insurance service result and 
insurance finance income or expenses."
"More information  
on presentation in the consolidated income statement is 
available under Accounting policies > Consolidated income 
statement > A Insurance service result, and under E Insurance

"This mainly concerns the items deferred acquisition costs 
and insurance-related receivables and liabilities such as 
accounts receivable and payable."
"Following the application 
of IFRS 17, deposits retained are also no longer presented 
separately, but are included in the insurance items."
"As part of the application of 
the new accounting policies, among other things, we now 
present non-financial assets and liabilities separately from 
financial assets and liabilities."
"Specifically in this context, we reclassified non-financial 
investments totalling €1,440m, which were previously 
presented in B.VI."
"“Other investments”, to the new item  
D.I."
“Non-financial investments”.
"In addition, investments amounting to €8,582m for unit-
linked life insurance contracts previously presented in item 
C."

to the new item E."
“Investments for unit-linked life insurance”.
"All financial assets resulting from insurance contracts are 
now presented together in item F."
"“Insurance-related 
financial instruments”."
"This mainly relates to derivatives 
accounted for separately from insurance contracts as well  
as hybrid contracts with host insurance contracts and 
embedded derivatives for which the fair value option  
was exercised."
"Insurance contracts that do not transfer 
significant insurance risk totalling €14,774m are also 
presented under this item."
"Financial receivables are presented separately and the 
previous item E."
"“Receivables” is broken down into current 
tax receivables, financial receivables and other receivables 
under the new item G."
"Derivatives are presented separately from non-derivative 
financial liabilities."
"“Liabilities” is broken 
down into derivatives, non-derivative financial liabilities, 
current tax liabilities and other liabilities."
"The comparative information for the items 
affected by the changes in presentation and classification 
has been restated."
"The balance sheet structure before and after the changes to 
the presentation and classification is, as at 1 January 2022, 
as set out in the table below."
"The items are measured 
according to the requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 17, 
including the overlay approach applied in relation to the 
application of IFRS 17 as well as the fair value model in 
relation to property which is held as underlying items under 
the measurement model of the VFA."

Names of statements and line items 
In addition, certain statements and line items were

"The renaming has no impact on the composition of the 
statements and line items, including their measurement."
"No restatements of the comparative information were 
therefore necessary."
"The changes to the names affect the 
following statements or line items: 
− The “Statement of recognised income and expense” has 
been renamed “Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income”."
"In addition, “Other comprehensive income” and 
“Total comprehensive income” are used as (sub-)totals in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income."
"− The balance sheet item “Land and buildings including 
buildings on third-party land” has been renamed 
“Investment property”."
"In 
addition, in line with our insurance business model, we now 
present cash flows from investment activities under cash 
flows from operating activities."
"Previously, these cash flows 
were presented under cash flows from investing activities."
"The IASB published amendments to the following 
standards, which have been adopted into European law – 
with the exception of the amendments to IAS 7, IAS 21 and 
IFRS 7: 
− Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial 
Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current or 
Non-current (rev."

Explanatory information 
Consolidation 
1 
Business combinations 
Munich Re obtained control in the 2022 financial year of 
ERGO Insurance (Thailand) Public Co."
"Ltd., Bangkok 
(ERGO Thailand), formerly named Thaisri Insurance Public 
Co."
"A provisional valuation of ERGO 
Thailand’s net assets was carried out as at 31 December 
2022."
"The valuation of ERGO Thailand’s net assets was 
completed in Q1 2023."
"Unlike the provisional valuation as 
at 31 December 2022, the completed valuation resulted in  
a negative consolidation difference of €9m, which was 
released directly to profit or loss and recognised in “Other 
operating income”."
Via its subsidiary ERGO Insurance (Thailand) Public Co.
"Ltd., Bangkok (ERGO Thailand) – formerly named Thaisri 
Insurance Public Co."
"Ltd., Bangkok – Munich Re acquired 
75.8% of the voting shares in Nam Seng Insurance Public Co."
"(NSI), Bangkok on 18 January 2023, and thus obtained 
control over NSI."
"The purchase price for the shareholding 
was €61m and was fully paid in cash from own funds."
NSI is a property-casualty insurer in Thailand.
"ERGO’s 
international growth strategy puts a focus on the attractive 
property-casualty markets in Southeast Asia."
"As the 
product portfolios of ERGO Thailand and NSI complement 
each other to a significant degree, there is material cross-
selling potential between both companies."
"This transaction 
puts ERGO Thailand in the position to further expand its 
market presence and continue to improve its competitive 
position on the Thai market."
"The transaction resulted in intangible assets of €15m and 
provisional goodwill of €13m."
"The valuation of NSI’s net 
assets related to insurance business was not yet completed 
at the reporting date."
"Non-controlling interests in NSI were 
provisionally valued at €12m at the acquisition date based 
on the share of identified net assets."
"The provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities of 
NSI at the acquisition date were as follows: investments  
of €87m; cash at banks, cheques and cash in hand of €13m; 
receivables and other asset items of €53m; equity of €52m; 
and provisions and liabilities of €101m."
"The fair value of  
the receivables acquired as part of the transaction largely 
corresponds to the carrying amount."
"There were no 
significant bad debts at the acquisition date."
"Furthermore, no 
material contingent liabilities existed at the acquisition date."
"For Munich Re, NSI’s contributions to the Group’s revenue 
and net result are of secondary importance."
"A further 23.67% of the shares were acquired for €19m in the 
first quarter of 2023, increasing Munich Re’s shareholding 
of NSI to 99.47%."
"As part of the integration of NSI, its assets and liabilities 
were assumed by ERGO Thailand as at 1 September 2023."

Our subsidiary D.A.S."
"Jogvédelmi Biztosíto Részvénytársaság, 
Budapest, was sold and deconsolidated in Q2 2023."
"Incurring a loss of €12.7m, the disposal had a negative impact 
on the net result."
"Gains or losses from the disposal of the other subsidiaries 
sold and deconsolidated in 2023 did not have any material 
impact on the net result."
"On 8 March 2023, Munich Re obtained control of Vier Gas 
Investments S.à r.l."
"(Vier Gas), Luxembourg, which had 
previously been accounted for in the consolidated balance 
sheet as a joint venture using the equity method."
"Our  
co-shareholder left the joint venture as part of a capital 
reduction and associated transfer of the entity’s assets."
"After the transaction, Munich Re held 100% of the voting 
shares in Vier Gas."
"The revaluation of the shares resulted  
in a gain in the low three-digit million euro range, which 
was recognised in the investment result."
"3 Associates and joint ventures 
On 20 February 2023, Munich Reinsurance Company 
acquired 50% of the shares in Saxon Land B.V., Amsterdam,

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
4 Structured entities 
Munich Re has interests both in consolidated and in 
unconsolidated structured entities."
"Munich Re classifies unconsolidated structured entities  
as either investment funds or securitisation vehicles on the 
basis of the type of structured entity."
"A distinction is made between investment funds in which 
Munich Re invests on its own behalf within the framework 
of its investment activities and investment funds in  
which Munich Re invests as part of its insurance-related 
investments and investments for unit-linked life insurance."
"Investment funds are mainly financed by issuing redeemable 
shares or units."
"Some of the investment funds are managed 
by MEAG, others by fund managers outside the Group."
"In 
the table below, we also report under “Investment funds”  
all investments in infrastructure, forestry, private equity and 
other investments."
"Munich Re invests in asset-backed securities that are 
issued by securitisation vehicles which are not set up by 
Munich Re."
"Furthermore, Munich Re uses securitisation 
vehicles to issue catastrophe bonds, and it also invests in 
third-party catastrophe bonds."
"Securitisation vehicles are 
self-financed by issuing securities."
"In order to protect its own portfolio, Munich Re uses 
alternative risk transfer in addition to traditional retrocession."
"Under this process, underwriting risks are transferred to 
the capital markets with the assistance of securitisation 
vehicles."
"Munich Re also invests in the area of catastrophe risks,  
for example in various securities whose repayment and 
interest is generally linked to the occurrence of natural 
catastrophes."
"The securities are issued by securitisation 
vehicles which as a matter of general policy are not set up 
by Munich Re."
"For investment funds, including investments in infrastructure, 
forestry, private equity and other investments, as well as 
insurance-related investments and investments for unit-
linked life insurance, the carrying amount gives an indication 
of the size of the structured entity."
"For asset-backed 
securities and the securitisation of underwriting risks, the 
emission volume (nominal value) is used as an indicator for 
measuring the size of the structured entity."
"The size of the 
funds refers to both the issued volume of the securitisation 
vehicles set up by Munich Re and that of those securitisation 
vehicles in which Munich Re has invested."
"With the exception of investment funds relating to 
investments for unit-linked life insurance, the maximum 
exposure to loss is the carrying amount of the respective 
items on the assets side."
"Therefore, for the items on the 
assets side, there is usually no difference between the 
carrying amount of interests in unconsolidated structured 
entities and the maximum exposure to loss."
"The maximum 
exposure to loss for underwriting risks is the carrying 
amount, unless the aggregation of insurance contracts 
results in the recognition of negative carrying amounts 
which were netted against positive carrying amounts."
"In 
instances where the recognised carrying amount is negative, 
the maximum exposure to loss is set at zero."
"Because of 
this, the maximum exposure to loss for the securitisation 
vehicles for underwriting risks can be greater overall than 
the carrying amounts of each of the respective asset and 
liability items on the consolidated balance sheet."
"Normally, the maximum exposure to loss for investments 
for unit-linked life insurance is also the carrying amount of 
the interests."
"However, this investment is held for the benefit 
of policyholders who bear the investment risk."
"MEAG MUNICH ERGO Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH 
also manages fund assets for private clients and 
institutional investors, for which it receives a management 
fee."
"The management fees are recognised as income in the 
consolidated income statement."
"Consolidated financial statements 
192 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
The maximum exposure to loss relates to the loss of future 
management fees."
"Fund management activities generated 
income of €53m (52m) in the financial year."
"The value of 
fund assets under management provides information about 
the size of the unconsolidated structured entities."
"As at 
31 December 2023, the managed fund assets amounted to 
€5,007m (4,501m), and Munich Re itself also holds a small 
interest in these funds."

Amsterdam; DAS Legal Finance B.V., Amsterdam; and 
DAS Nederlandse Rechtsbijstand Verzekeringmaatschappij 
N.V., Amsterdam – was classified as held for sale in

"No significant value adjustments resulted

"The company was deconsolidated  
in Q2 2023."
"Our subsidiary American Digital Title Insurance Company, 
Brighton, Colorado, was still classified as held for sale at 
the reporting date."
"No value adjustments resulted from the 
classification."
"In July 2023, we sold Globality S.A., Munsbach, to  
Foyer S.A., a financial group from Luxembourg."
"No value 
adjustments resulted from the classification as held for 
sale."
Deconsolidation occurred in Q3 2023.
"There is still a 
strategic partnership between Globality, Foyer and ERGO."
"In Q2 2023, we classified DAS UK Holdings Limited, 
Bristol – with its subsidiaries DAS Services Limited, DAS 
Legal Expenses Insurance Company Limited, and DAS Law 
Limited – as held for sale."
"No significant value adjustments 
were required."
The disposal took place in Q1 2024.
"Further information on disposals due to loss of control can 
be found in this chapter under “Consolidation”."
"The other reserves of Group equity include an amount of 
€13m for disposal groups, of which €3m is attributable to 
unrealised losses on fixed-interest securities and €10m to 
unrealised losses on the currency translation reserve."
"In our segment reporting, we disclose how the non-current 
assets held for sale are allocated between the segments."
"Transactions between the disposal group and the Group’s 
continuing operations continued to be fully eliminated."
"Financial investments are allocated to Level 1 and Level 2 of 
the fair value hierarchy."
"We therefore transact their business from 
within reinsurance and consequently allocate them to the 
reinsurance segments."
"The IFRS result contributions are 
the basis of planning and strategy in all segments, hence 
the IFRS segment result is the uniform assessment basis 
for internal management."
"Assets and liabilities in connection with intra-Group loans 
are presented on an unconsolidated basis in accordance 
with the way they are managed internally, and income and 
expenses from such loans are likewise presented on an 
unconsolidated basis in the segment income statement."
"All 
other items are presented after elimination of intra-Group 
transactions and shareholdings."

"7 Alternative performance measures 
In addition to IFRS metrics, Munich Re uses alternative 
performance measures to measure its financial performance."
"These alternative performance measures are not defined or 
set out in IFRSs and provide useful information about our 
financial position and performance and contribute to the 
understandability of our results."
"They serve to supplement, 
not replace, the metrics defined in the IFRSs."
"Similarly 
named alternative performance measures published by other 
companies have potentially been calculated differently and 
might therefore not be comparable, or be comparable only 
to a limited extent."
"Gross premiums written 
Under IFRS 4, gross premiums written were the key 
measure of revenue and comprised all premium income 
due for payment in a financial year."
"Under IFRS 17, 
however, the reporting metric is insurance revenue, which 
is calculated based on the services provided from the 
groups of insurance contracts."
"Insurance revenue is 
substantially lower than gross premiums written because 
premium amounts that are repaid to policyholders under  
all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event 
occurs (investment component), are not recognised as 
insurance revenue."
"This relates in particular to commissions 
and profit commissions in reinsurance business."
"In the interest of 
comparability, we disclose gross premiums written as an 
alternative performance measure."
"Gross premiums written 
are no longer used as a performance indicator for corporate 
growth."
"They have been superseded by insurance revenue as 
a corporate management tool for the Group."

Combined ratio 
The combined ratio is a regularly used metric for property-

"It is calculated as the percentage ratio of 
the insurance service expenses and insurance revenue, 
both of which on a net basis, i.e."
after reinsurance cessions.
"Given that the combined ratio takes into account the time 
value of money and the uncertainty of future cash flows, it 
can also be used to assess economic profitability."

"Return on equity (RoE) 
The return on equity (RoE) is an important profitability KPI, 
which is of relevance in particular in the medium term."
"It  
is calculated on the basis of the Group’s IFRS net result in 
relation to the average IFRS equity at the beginning and 
end of the year."
"IFRS equity is adjusted in particular for the 
fair value reserve, the foreign currency translation reserve, 
the insurance finance reserve (from the measurement of 
insurance contracts) and the reserve from hedging 
relationships."
"Further adjustments are made to eliminate 
distortions attributable to intra-Group transactions."
"IFRS 
equity is affected by profits as well as by capital measures 
such as dividend payments and share buy-backs, in 
particular."
"The RoE is recognised for the Group and for  
the reinsurance and ERGO fields of business."
"The corresponding reallocation of the existing goodwill to 
these divisions did not have any effects on the value."
"Impairment tests for cash-generating units to which a 
significant portion of the goodwill was allocated are based 
on the assumptions shown below."

"Our general assumption was that 
there would be moderate upward 
movement on the equity markets 
and a stable interest-rate level."
"For the detailed planning phase

insurance revenue and an improved 
combined ratio if major losses

"Prepared in an interactive process involving the operational 
units, the responsible controlling units and the Board of 
Management, the corporate plans are reviewed and updated 
at least every quarter."
"The target results were determined 
based on the assumption that the Ukraine war and the 
current economic situation, including future inflation trends, 
would not significantly affect the earnings prospects of our 
business models on a permanent basis."
"The climate risks  
inherent in our business model for our insurance business 
have been taken into account in the distributable target 
results."
"The aforementioned key assumptions regarding insurance 
revenue development and combined ratios derive from  
the aggregation of the corporate plans of the individual 
companies of a cash-generating unit."

regarding developments in the equity market and interest-
rate level are defined on the basis of the current market 
environment."

"After the detailed planning phase, 
we estimate the target results to be achievable in the long 
term on the basis of the last adjusted planning year and 
taking into account growth rates and RoI derived from 
macroeconomic forecasts."
"Cost-of-equity rates derived using the capital asset pricing 
model (CAPM) were used as discount rates."
"In this regard,  
the rising interest rates observed in the past financial year 
were taken into account."
"When deriving discount rates 
based on capital market data, we assume that the climate 
risks expected by the capital markets are included in  
their return expectations."
"Calculations were made after 
consideration of normalised taxes."
"In the table, for 
disclosure purposes, a corresponding discount rate before

"10 Reinsurance contracts held 
We apply the general measurement model to life and health 
reinsurance contracts held because the coverage period 
tends to be long."
"We measure the majority of our property-
casualty reinsurance contracts held in accordance with the 
premium allocation approach."
"The following tables present the changes during the 
financial year, broken down by asset components, for 
reinsurance contracts held that are measured using the 
general measurement model and the premium allocation 
approach."
"The reconciliation tables thus show the changes 
from opening to closing balances for the assets for remaining 
coverage and the assets for the recovery of incurred claims."
"The assets for remaining coverage are broken down further 
into assets with and without a loss-recovery component."
"Changes in the asset components arise from the insurance 
service result, investment components, insurance finance 
income or expenses, other value changes, changes 
recognised in other comprehensive income, and changes in 
cash inflows and outflows."

"In this reconciliation, the

adjustment for our insurance portfolios measured using  
the premium allocation approach only includes the assets 
for the recovery of incurred claims."
"Consequently, the table reveals 
which changes in the present values of expected net cash 
flows and in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk 
occurred during the year and how these changes affected 
the net cost/gain."
"When applying the premium allocation approach, neither the present value of expected net cash flows nor a risk adjustment for non-financial risk or the net 
cost/gain for assets for remaining coverage are explicitly determined."

"Of particular note under “Reclassifications” was a change

the fair value model was as follows:

"The negative changes in fair value primarily reflect reduced 
market demand, particularly for commercial properties, and 
changes in the interest-rate environment, which translated 
into higher discount rates."
"The reclassifications involved properties that we classified 
as held for sale."
"The decarbonisation of our investment portfolio is part of 
our climate strategy."
"ESG aspects and risks related to 
climate change are taken into account when determining 
the fair values used to measure properties."

the carrying amounts was low in the reporting year."

"The remaining portfolio is composed

as well as by companies outside the banking sector, and 
asset-backed securities/mortgage-backed securities."
"Any 
single investment accounts for less than 1% of the total 
investment portfolio."
"The asset-backed securities and 
mortgage-backed securities are largely rated A or better."
"The 
proportion of the instruments shown above that have a lifetime 
of less than one year amounted to €27,348m (24,950m)."
"Of the securities shown, €3,633m (2,326m) are what are 
known as green bonds."
"We also hold more than €190m in 
bonds with ESG characteristics; the interest rates of these 
securities and loans will rise if pre-defined ESG targets are 
not met."
"This means that the ESG characteristics do not 
give rise to any additional risks."
"On the contrary, additional 
interest income would offset the elevated risks triggered  
by a failure to meet ESG targets."
"We manage bonds with 
ESG characteristics within the business model “hold to 
collect and sell”."
"Many of these bonds pass the SPPI test 
and are therefore measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income."
"We have implicitly taken climate 
risks and other ESG risks into account in our determination 
of fair values using the respective forward-looking valuation 
inputs, provided that they have an influence on price in the 
capital markets in which the products of relevance here are 
traded."
"Fixed-interest securities and loans pledged as security and 
other restrictions on title amounted to €8,506m (9,071m)."
"€3,201m (2,927m) of the securities reported were transferred 
to third parties, but with us retaining substantially all risks 
and rewards."
"As a result, these securities have not been 
derecognised."
"Assets pledged as security and other restrictions on title 
amounted to €68m (61m) for deposits with banks."
"Deposits 
with banks include receivables of €65m (19m) from 
repurchase sellers under repurchase agreements that have 
been booked by us as the repurchase buyer."
"For these 
receivables, the repurchase seller provided collateral of €73m 
(39m) in Munich Re’s favour."
"Of the amounts held on deposit 
with banks, €2,884m (2,822m) was due within one year."
"Derivatives are used by Munich Re to manage and hedge 
against interest-rate, currency, and other market risks."
"Given the daily collateral-adjustment process, the risk of 
default can essentially be disregarded in the case of 
products traded on the stock exchange and for centrally 
cleared and secured over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives."
"In 
order to minimise the risk of default for non-listed unsecured 
OTC derivatives as well, Munich Re conducts such business 
only with counterparties of high creditworthiness and 
exchanges collateral daily on the basis of current fair values."
"As at 31 December 2023, Munich Re held collateral for 
derivatives in the form of cash collateral and securities with 
a rating of at least AA."
"The collateral received is subject to 
a title transfer collateral arrangement, but is not re-sold or 
pledged."
"€167,254m (157,685m) of the fixed-interest securities  
and loans were measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income because they pass the SPPI  
test."
"The other fixed-interest securities and loans were 
measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Equities,

"In the financial year, Munich Re bought back 3,043,376 
shares as part of the 2022/2023 share buy-back programme 
completed on 21 April 2023 and the 2023/2024 share buy-
back programme, which was approved by the Board of 
Management on 22 February 2023."
"It provides for the 
acquisition of shares up to a value of €1bn before the 2024 
Annual General Meeting."
"The acquisition costs of all Munich Re shares in the 
possession of Group companies at the end of the financial 
year totalled €665,006,064.13."
"A total of €1,583m was distributed to Munich Reinsurance 
Company’s equity holders for the 2022 financial year in the 
form of a dividend of €11.60 per dividend-bearing share."
"In addition, for some 
financial instruments, the reclassification had an impact  
on unrealised gains and losses recognised in other 
comprehensive income, leading to a decrease of €1,595m  
in “Other reserves”."
"For details, please refer to Accounting 
policies > Changes in accounting policies and other 
adjustments > Effects from the initial application of IFRS 9 
> Classification and measurement of financial instruments."
"Further comments can be found under Accounting policies 
> Changes in accounting policies and other adjustments 
> Effects from the initial application of IFRS 9 > Impact on 
equity."
"Of the total amount reclassified from “Other reserves” to 
“Retained earnings”, €1,077m was attributable to financial 
instruments held as underlying items of insurance 
contracts accounted for under the VFA."
"A corresponding 
reclassification from “Other reserves” to “Retained earnings” 
was therefore required for the insurance contracts concerned."
"26 Insurance contracts issued 
Due to the extended coverage periods, we use the general 
measurement model for our (re)insurance contracts issued 
in the life and health reinsurance segment."
"We measure our 
property-casualty insurance contracts issued in accordance 
with the premium allocation approach if they meet the 
applicable requirements."
"This applies to the majority of our 
property-casualty business."
"For large parts of the German 
and some parts of the international participating life and 
health primary insurance business, the variable fee 
approach is used."
"Since both property as well as life and 
health primary insurance contracts are issued in the ERGO 
International segment, all three measurement models of 
IFRS 17 are used in this segment."
"The liability for remaining 
coverage is split into the liability for remaining coverage 
excluding the loss component and the loss component."
"Changes in the liability components arise from the insurance 
service result, investment components, insurance finance 
income or expenses, other value changes, changes recognised 
in other comprehensive income, and changes in cash 
inflows or outflows."
"An explanation of the above-mentioned 
items and the effects on the consolidated income 
statement can be found under “Notes to the consolidated 
income statement”."
"Changes in the measurement components 
also arise from the insurance service result, investment 
components, insurance finance income or expenses, other 
changes in value and changes in cash inflows and outflows."
"Consequently, the tables reveal which changes arose in the 
present values of expected net cash flows and in the risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk during the year and how 
these changes affected the contractual service margin."
"The liability for remaining coverage for insurance contracts 
issued which were measured using the premium allocation 
approach is not included."
"When applying the premium 
allocation approach, neither the present value of expected 
net cash flows nor a risk adjustment for non-financial risk 
or a contractual service margin for the liability for remaining 
coverage are explicitly determined."
"The property-casualty 
reinsurance and ERGO Property-casualty Germany  
segments are not shown, as these insurance contracts 
issued are measured predominantly using the premium 
allocation approach, meaning that the contractual service 
margin is of minor importance in these segments."

"The following tables present the effects on the contractual

insurance contracts issued that were measured at the 
transition date applying the full retrospective, modified 
retrospective and fair value approaches."
"This disclosure is 
only relevant for insurance contracts measured under the 
general measurement model or the variable fee approach."
"The associated insurance revenue also includes insurance 
contracts issued measured as at the transition date by 
applying the premium allocation approach."

"28 Liability for incurred claims 
The tables below illustrate how claims and claims payments 
in the property-casualty business have changed over the past 
ten years."
"Given complete information regarding all losses 
incurred up to the end of the reporting period, the ultimate-
loss status for each accident-year period would remain the 
same."
"In practice, however, the ultimate-loss status (based 
on estimates) is exposed to fluctuations that reflect  
the growth in knowledge about the claims."
"Changes in  
the consolidated group, especially new acquisitions, or  
the composition of reportable segments, can also have an 
influence on the ultimate-loss status."
"The run-off triangles are prepared on a currency-adjusted 
basis."
"To determine the effects of currency remeasurement, 
which are presented separately, all balances were 
translated from the respective local currency into the Group 
currency (euro) on the basis of the exchange rate applicable 
as at the reporting date."
"The following table shows the reconciliation of the nominal 
property-casualty liability (net) to the liability for incurred 
claims recognised in the balance sheet."
"The liability for 
incurred claims recognised in the balance sheet (net) of

"The pension commitments comprise obligations 
towards active members or retired members with vested 
benefits, and current pension payments."
"Defined benefit 
plans are funded internally through provisions for post-
employment benefits and externally through funds and 
insurance contracts concluded to cover the benefit obligations."
"Expenses for defined contribution plans totalled €107m 
(98m) in the financial year, and expenses for contributions 
to state plans amounted to €126m (120m)."
"The present value of obligations under defined benefit 
pension plans amounted to €5,013m (4,609m), and the 
plan assets to be deducted totalled €4,069m (3,759m)."
"Defined benefit plans comprise the following main plans: 
Munich Reinsurance Company’s pension obligations 
account for €1,298m (1,155m) of the present value of 
obligations under defined benefit pension plans and 
€1,514m (1,396m) of plan assets."
"The obligations include 
disability and old-age pensions, and pensions for surviving 
dependants."
"The amount of the pensions generally depends 
on salary and length of service."
"The defined benefits granted 
up to 31 December 2007 are financed through a fund."
"New 
members on or after 1 January 2008 receive pension 
commitments in the form of defined contribution plans 
funded by means of intra-Group insurance contracts 
securing the obligations under pension schemes."
"The fund 
and insurance contracts have been grouped in a contractual 
trust arrangement (CTA)."
"ERGO Group’s pension obligations account for €2,476m 
(2,229m) of the present value of obligations under defined 
benefit pension plans and €1,421m (1,271m) of plan assets, 
with both figures being impacted by IFRS 5 reclassification."
"The obligations include disability and old-age pensions, 
and pensions for surviving dependants."
"The amount of the 
pensions generally depends on salary and length of service."
"The obligations are generally funded through pension 
provisions, although for ERGO significant portions have 
been funded through a pension fund since 1 April 2022."
"New members receive pension commitments in the form of 
defined contribution plans funded by means of intra-Group 
insurance contracts securing the obligations under pension 
schemes."
There are also medical-care benefit obligations.
"The pension obligations of Munich Reinsurance America, 
Inc."
"account for €587m (601m) of the present value of 
obligations under defined benefit plans, and €469m (453m) 
of plan assets."
"The obligations include pensions for 
employees and surviving dependants."
"The amount of the 
pensions generally depends on includable compensation 
and length of service."
"The plan is funded through a fund 
and pension provisions."
"The plan was closed to new 
members effective 1 January 2006 and to all remaining 
members effective 31 December 2011."
"With effect from 
1 January 2012, all members now receive pension 
commitments in the form of defined contribution plans."
There are also retiree medical-care benefit obligations.

"The relationship between the fair value of the plan assets 
and the present value of the defined benefit obligations is 
referred to as the funded status."
"If the present value of 
defined benefit obligations exceeds the fair value of the 
plan assets, this excess of liabilities over assets is financed 
by means of provisions for post-employment benefits."
"If the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the present value 
of the defined benefit obligations, an asset arises out of the 
defined benefit plan."
"As each plan is analysed individually, 
this may give rise to both a provision for post-employment 
benefits and an asset from the defined benefit plan."
"Market fluctuations may give rise to changes in the fair 
value of the plan assets over time."
"Adjustments to the 
actuarial assumptions (e.g."
"life expectancy, discount rate) or

“hold to collect” and – since they pass the SPPI test – are 
thus measured at amortised cost."
"Investments for unit-linked life insurance and insurance-
related financial instruments are managed within the 
business model “other” based on their fair value."
"They each 
constitute a class."
"Insurance-related financial instruments 
also include hybrid contracts with host insurance contracts 
that are designated as measured at fair value through profit 
or loss due to embedded derivatives that must be separated."
"Financial receivables and cash and cash equivalents are 
managed within the business model “hold to collect” and – 
if they pass the SPPI test – are measured at amortised cost."
"If they do not, measurement is at fair value through profit or 
loss."
"We also assign lease receivables to the class of financial 
receivables; however, they do not fall into one of the IFRS 9 
measurement categories."
"Subordinated 
liabilities constitute a class of their own, whereas liabilities 
are broken down into several classes."
"Derivatives and 
insurance-related liabilities each constitute a class of their 
own."
"Non-derivative liabilities are broken down into bonds 
and notes issued, liabilities to credit institutions, and other 
financial liabilities."
"The following table provides an overview of the net  
result from financial assets and liabilities by measurement 
category."
"In addition to the results from the change in the fair value 
of financial instruments measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, the effects recognised in profit or loss include 
the change in risk provisions recognised in profit or loss."
"Depending on the underlying financial instrument, net results 
recognised in profit or loss are presented in the consolidated 
income statement either in the result from insurance-
related financial instruments, in the investment result or in 
the investment result for unit-linked life insurance."
"Results not recognised in profit or loss arise at Munich Re 
in particular from the subsequent measurement of debt 
instruments mandatorily measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income."
"They are recognised in other 
comprehensive income as part of unrealised gains and 
losses."
"The effects of disposals on profit or loss arise only for  
debt instruments mandatorily measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income and financial 
instruments measured at amortised cost."
"In the case of 
instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
the instrument is measured at fair value prior to disposal  
to ensure no gains/losses arise from the disposal of the 
instrument."
"Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
gave rise to gains and losses on disposal of €0m (5,447m) 
and €0m (1,991m) respectively."
"The gross interest result is attributable to financial 
instruments that are not measured at fair value through

"The derivative components 
of catastrophe bonds are measured based on the values 
supplied by brokers for the underlying bonds, which is why 
the extent to which unobservable inputs were used cannot 
readily be assessed."
"The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based 
on the present-value method or established option pricing 
models using mostly observable market inputs such as 
interest-rate curve volatilities or exchange rates."
"Insurance derivatives and insurance contracts that do not 
transfer significant insurance risk are mostly allocated to 
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
"This is assessed on a 
case-by-case basis, taking into account the characteristics of 
the financial instrument concerned."
"In this case, exclusively 
observable market inputs are often unavailable, so that 
biometric rates (including lapse rates) and historical event 
data are used for valuation on the basis of the present-value 
method."
"The inputs required in measuring variable annuities are 
derived either directly from market data (in particular 
volatilities, interest-rate curves and currency spot rates) or 
from actuarial data (especially biometric and lapse rates)."
"The lapse rates used are modelled dynamically depending 
on the specific insurance product and current capital 
market situation."
"Mortality assumptions are based on 
client-specific data or published mortality tables, which  
are adjusted with regard to the target markets and the 
actuaries’ expectations."
"The dependencies between 
different capital market inputs are modelled by correlation 
matrices."
"Where the valuation of these products is not 
based on observable inputs, which is usually the case, we 
allocate them to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
"The other investments allocated to Level 3 are mainly 
external fund units (in particular, private equity, real estate 
and funds that invest in a variety of assets that are subject 
to theoretical valuation)."
"Since market quotes are not 
available on a regular basis, net asset values (NAVs) are 
provided by asset managers."
"The NAVs are determined by 
adding up all the fund assets and subtracting all the fund 
liabilities."
"The NAV per fund unit is calculated by dividing 
the NAV by the number of outstanding fund units."
"We thus 
do not perform our own valuations using unobservable inputs."
"We regularly perform plausibility tests over the valuations 
supplied on the basis of comparable investments."
"We have taken climate risks and other ESG risks into 
account implicitly in our determination of fair values using 
the respective forward-looking valuation inputs, provided 
that they have an influence on price in the capital markets 
in which the products of relevance here are traded."
"Among the associates and joint ventures accounted for 
using the equity method, there is only one investment for 
which a quoted market price is available."
"This price 
amounts to €43m (51m) and is allocated to Level 1 of the 
fair value hierarchy."
"The fair value of investment property managed by Munich Re 
is measured by valuation experts within the Group, while 
the fair value of investment property managed by third 
parties is measured by external valuation experts."
"Property 
is allocated to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
"The 
valuation is based on determining future expected income 
and expenses, taking into account the market conditions at 
the property location."
"The fair value is determined individually 
per item by discounting the future net cash inflows to the 
measurement date."
"Depending on the type of property and 
its individual risk/reward profile, discount rates of 1.4% to 
4.5% are used for residential buildings, and 1.4% to 7.6% for 
office buildings and commercial property."
"The measurement of subordinated liabilities for which 
quoted market prices are not available is performed using 
the present-value method and taking observable market 
inputs into account."
"For the bonds we have issued, we use 
the quoted market prices of corresponding assets provided 
by price quoters to measure the fair value."
"The fair values  
of our liabilities to credit institutions are determined using 
the present-value method, in part exclusively using 
observable market inputs, and partly also taking into account 
unobservable inputs."
"In the following table, we present the fair values of our 
assets at the reporting date for each level of the fair value 
hierarchy."
"Regularly, at each reporting date, we assess whether the 
allocation of our assets and liabilities to the levels of the fair 
value hierarchy is still appropriate."
"If changes in the basis  
of valuation have occurred – for instance, if a market is no 
longer active or the valuation was performed using inputs 
requiring a different allocation – we make the necessary 
adjustments."
"In the following tables, we present the assets transferred to 
a different level of the fair value hierarchy in the reporting 
period or the previous period."
"No transfers between the levels 
of the fair value hierarchy were carried out for liabilities in 
the current reporting period or the previous financial year."

as at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in equity, 
we present it as part of unrealised gains and losses in

"When the financial liabilities 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss are 
derecognised, the amount of change in the fair value 
attributable to changes in the credit risk and recognised  
in other comprehensive income is transferred to retained 
earnings."
"Sensitivity of unobservable inputs used to measure  
fair value 
If the value of financial instruments is based on unobservable 
inputs, the value of these inputs at the reporting date is 
derived using a range of reasonably possible alternatives 
that are determined based on management judgement."
"The values we select for such unobservable inputs used to 
measure fair value are reasonable and commensurate  
with the prevailing market conditions and the respective 
measurement approach."
"The following information sets out the significant 
unobservable inputs for financial assets and liabilities 
allocated to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, and 
subsequently illustrates the effect that a change in the 
inputs has on the fair value."
"The sensitivities presented 
 
 
Consolidated financial statements 
282 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
have been calculated based on the assumption that only 
the inputs in question have changed."
"In reality, however,  
it is unlikely that changes in market conditions affect only 
one input."
"For that reason, the effects shown here on the 
fair values calculated may differ from the actual changes in 
fair value."
"It should also be noted that the disclosures are 
neither a prediction nor an indication of future changes in 
fair value."
"Significant estimation uncertainties and judgements are 
involved in measuring instruments that are subject to credit 
risk if no issuer rating is available and it is not possible to 
access prices for traded financial instruments from the issuer."
"This usually applies to mortgage loans and infrastructure 
loans."
"In such cases, we use our internal rating model to 
estimate the issuer’s credit risk and determine, on the basis 
of their operating sector, geographic location and 
creditworthiness, the interest-rate curve to apply to measure 
the fair value."
"If the interest-rate curve were to increase or 
decrease, it would lead to a decrease or increase in the fair 
value of interest-sensitive financial investments."
"A significant share of the insurance-related financial 
instruments is comprised of annuity policies and life 
insurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance 
risk."
"Here, actuarial data such as biometric data (mortality 
rates) and lapse rates are the underlying significant 
unobservable inputs."
"A decrease (or increase) in lapse rates, 
mortality rates or annuity claims would lead to a higher  
(or lower) fair value."
"In the case of contracts that provide  
high death benefits, the effect for lapse rate changes may 
be reversed."
"A decrease (or increase) in the exercising of 
withdrawal plans would lead to a lower (or higher) fair 
value."
"Other instruments for which we used significant 
unobservable inputs to measure the fair value are unlisted 
fund investments, investments in private-equity companies 
and direct investments in non-listed companies."
"For  
these assets, the fair value is determined based on the net 
asset value of the investment."
"Any changes in the net asset 
value would lead to a corresponding adjustment of the fair 
value, i.e."
"a 10% increase (or decrease) in the net asset 
value would mean that the fair value would also increase 
(or decrease) by 10%."
"For information on fair 
value measurement, please refer to this chapter under 
“43 Fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities”."
"To reduce the credit risk associated with these financial 
assets, we enter into contracts for the provision of collateral."
"These types of agreements also include a requirement to 
provide cash collateral or to issue guarantees."
"We exercise the option for our insurance-related 
liabilities, since they are managed at fair value in the same 
way as insurance-related financial instruments."
"If the effect 
of changes in value due to a change in our credit risk was 
recognised separately in other comprehensive income, the 
offsetting effect of designating these instruments would be 
lower."
"Overall, given our excellent creditworthiness and the 
collateral agreed in the contracts, our credit risk and the 
resulting changes are of minor significance."
"The cumulative changes in value in relation to our own 
credit risk are reclassified from other comprehensive 
income to retained earnings when the corresponding 
liability is derecognised."
"The following table shows our financial liabilities that we 
have designated as measured at fair value through profit  
or loss and for which changes in the value of our own credit 
risk are recognised in other comprehensive income."
"The 
overview contains instruments that satisfy the offsetting 
criteria and are therefore offset in the balance sheet, as  
well as those instruments that are subject to an enforceable 
netting agreement, but are not permitted to be offset  
in the balance sheet."
"The overview does not include off-
balance-sheet securities lending transactions without cash 
collaterals."
"46 Transfers of financial assets 
In the context of securities repurchase and securities 
lending, we transfer bonds and other securities."
"However, 
due to the structure of these agreements, we retain the 
risks and rewards of ownership of these financial assets 
arising from the credit, interest-rate and currency risk."
"This 
means that the requirements for derecognition are not met 
and the financial assets continue to be recognised in the 
consolidated balance sheet."
"The amount received from the 
repurchase buyer is, however, presented as a non-derivative 
financial liability."
"For securities repurchase transactions, the 
amount of this liability at the transaction date corresponds 
to the fair value of the securities transferred less a safety 
margin."
"When the instruments are transferred back upon 
the securities repurchase transaction reaching maturity, 
this amount, plus the agreed interest, is repaid to the 
repurchase buyer."
"Under the repurchase agreements in 
place as at the reporting date, we act exclusively as the 
repurchase buyer."
"In securities lending, the corresponding 
liability corresponds to the obligation to repay the cash 
collaterals received, which are repaid to the counterparty 
less the fees retained at the end of the lending period."
"As 
the securities lending transactions entered into are secured 
not with cash collateral but with securities that we do not 
recognise because the recognition criteria are not met, 
there are no corresponding liabilities within this context."
"The following table shows, as at the reporting date, the 
carrying amounts and fair values of the assets transferred 
and the corresponding liabilities that continue to be

"Credit risk 
When determining credit risk, we firstly use a portfolio 
model and secondly analyse the credit risk exposure of 
investments on a per-debtor basis."
"If the credit risk also depends on other factors beyond  
the debtor’s creditworthiness (such as subordination, 
guarantees or collateralisation), these are also taken  
into consideration."
"We use historical capital market data  
to determine the associated migration and default 
probabilities."
"Correlation effects between debtors are 
derived from the sectors and countries in which they 
operate."
"The assessment of the credit risk from other 
receivables is based on internal expert assessments."
"Risk concentrations exist primarily in government bonds 
and corporate bonds, as well as in pfandbriefs and similar 
covered bonds."
"A Group-wide counterparty limit system ensures the 
management and monitoring of Group-wide credit risks."
"With regard to country risks, we use both standard ratings 
and our own analyses, which also take climate change risks 
into account."
"The limits and measures derived from this  
are binding for investment decisions and the insurance of 
political risks."
"In order to fulfil the requirements for monitoring and 
managing credit risks, the sensitivities are regularly 
checked against the most important input parameters."
"In addition to monitoring credit risk under the internal 
model, we have implemented continuous monitoring of 
financial investments on the basis of internal and external 
credit ratings."
"We also mitigate credit risk by providing 
collateral."
"For exchange-traded derivatives and derivatives 
subject to a clearing process, this is done through automated 
daily margining."
"For the majority of our OTC derivatives, we 
have agreed a similar process of adjusting the collateral on 
a daily basis."
"Unsecured OTC derivatives are entered into 
only with counterparties with good creditworthiness."
"In the balance sheet, credit risk is accounted for by 
recognising expected credit losses as impairment losses  
on financial assets measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income or at amortised cost."
"In addition, 
lease receivables are subject to the impairment 
requirements of IFRS 9."
"We calculate the expected credit 
losses by using a parameter-based approach."
"This involves 
measuring the expected credit losses on a per-transaction 
basis, using statistical risk parameters in accordance with 
our credit risk guidelines."
"The key parameters are probability 
of default, loss given default and exposure at default."
"Probability of default is calculated on the basis of our internal 
rating model, which takes account of not only historical 
information, but also current market conditions and the 
relevant forward-looking information (such as forecast 
macroeconomic developments)."
"Our internal rating categories 
are based on those of the leading international rating 
agencies."
"For financial assets allocated to Stage 1 of the 
impairment model, the probabilities of default are always 
calculated on the basis of the risk of default for the next 
12 months."
"If the instrument’s remaining maturity is less 
than one year, the probability is determined for this maturity."
"Probabilities of default for maturities of more than one year 
used to determine lifetime expected credit losses at Stage 2 
are determined by extrapolating migration matrices of 
default probabilities for the next 12 months."
"Financial assets 
allocated to Stage 3 of the impairment model are always 
analysed on a case-by-case basis."
"The loss given default is calculated at 100% less the 
recovery rate."
"The recovery rates for the respective financial 
assets are derived from the recovery and default studies 
published by the rating agencies and adjusted by taking 
expert opinions into account."
"Consolidated financial statements

The exposure at default corresponds to the gross carrying 
amount as at the reporting date."
"Current financial receivables and lease receivables are not 
normally subject to material historical default."
"This means 
that it is not usually appropriate to calculate the impairment 
loss on the basis of this information."
"We therefore determine 
the credit losses on these types of receivables using a 
simplified formula."
"We base this process on a conservative 
analysis of the probability of default, which corresponds  
to the lowest rating within the investment grade."
"In 
accordance with the ISDA convention, a loss given default 
of 60% is assumed for senior unsecured corporate debt."
"The amount of loss given default corresponds to the gross 
carrying amount."
"No impairment losses are normally recognised for cash and 
cash equivalents as these financial instruments are only 
entered into with counterparties of first-class financial 
strength."
"Moreover, the maximum maturity of these financial 
assets is three months."
"The credit risk resulting from  
these financial instruments is therefore immaterial and is 
monitored continuously."
"In the tables below, we present the reconciliation of loss 
allowances on financial assets measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income or at amortised cost."
"At 
Munich Re, this covers the economic classes of “Instruments 
subject to interest-rate and credit risk” and “Alternative 
investments”."

The carrying amounts of financial assets measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income are not reduced 
by recognising impairment losses."
"The loss allowance is 
presented in other comprehensive income."
"For financial assets measured at amortised cost, on the 
other hand, the loss allowance is recognised directly as a 
reduction of the carrying amount."
"Financial assets measured at amortised cost essentially 
relate only to short-term deposits, sight deposits and 
financial receivables with remaining maturities of less than 
90 days."
"The short remaining maturities generally mean 
that the review period is too short for assessing whether 
credit risk is significantly increased."
"For this reason, these 
instruments are predominantly allocated to Stage 1 of the 
impairment model."
"However, if there is objective evidence 
of impairment, we allocate these types of instruments to 
Stage 3."
"The “Remeasured due to change in measurement parameters” 
line item in the above table refers exclusively to the loss 
allowance and has no influence on the gross carrying amount."
"Portfolio changes resulting from transfers between stages 
represent additions and reversals that arose in the reporting 
period due to a change in the stage allocation."
"Impairment 
losses relate to amounts of financial assets derecognised 
that are no longer expected to be recovered."
"Disposals, on 
the other hand, show reversals of loss allowances for assets 
settled or sold in the reporting period."
"Other changes 
mainly reflect changes in accrued interest paid."
"We consider derecognised financial assets non-recoverable 
if they are still subject to an enforcement activity."
"In the previous year, impairment losses were recognised on 
Russian and Ukrainian bonds and loans in a total amount of 
€849m in accordance with the provisions set out in IAS 39."
"A large portion of these fixed-interest securities and loans 
had been disposed of by the end of 2022."
"Further impairment 
losses of €1,849m were attributable to equity instruments 
measured at fair value through profit or loss pursuant  
to IFRS 9, meaning that they are no longer subject to the 
impairment requirements."
"Non-substantial modifications of financial assets that arise 
because of adjustments to the contract terms do not lead to 
the derecognition of the assets recognised."
"However, the 
modification may lead to a change in expected credit losses."
"The credit risk of modified financial assets is therefore 
remeasured at the modification date and compared to the 
original credit risk."
"No non-substantial modifications were 
made to financial assets during the financial year."
"The maximum credit risk associated with a financial asset 
corresponds to the gross carrying amount less loss 
allowances."
"The tables below also show the net default 
exposure arising from the maximum credit risk, less the 
respective collateral (limited to the respective maximum 
credit risk) or other credit enhancements."

arising from our financial liabilities, divided into maturity 
bands."
"The information relates to undiscounted contractual 
cash outflows from the financial liabilities."
"These are 
allocated to the earliest maturity band in which the cash 
outflow is possible."
"Cash outflows from financial liabilities 
payable on demand are therefore allocated to the earliest 
possible time band."
"The same applies to financial liabilities 
with termination options, for which the cash outflows are 
allocated to the earliest possible termination date."
"If the 
cash outflows from a financial liability are not fixed, the 
amount presented represents the cash outflows as they 
would be required on the basis of the market data applicable 
as at the reporting date."
"Amounts in foreign currency were 
translated at the period-end exchange rate."
"Our 
financial instruments are subject to equity, interest-rate 
and currency risk in this context."
"We also include the 
inflation risk and the risk of changes in implicit volatilities 
in our definition of market risk."
"Market risks are modelled by means of Monte Carlo 
simulation of possible future market scenarios."
"We revalue 
our assets and liabilities for each simulated market scenario, 
thus showing the probability distribution for changes to basic 
own funds in accordance with Solvency II."
"We use appropriate limit and early-warning systems in  
our asset-liability management to manage market risks."
"Derivative financial instruments are used, most of which 
are concluded for hedging purposes."
"Other risks 
As part of the interest-rate benchmark reform (IBOR 
reform), existing IBOR benchmark interest rates and 
overnight interest rates are being reviewed and replaced  
by risk-free rates around the world."
"On account of the discontinuation of the US dollar LIBOR 
as from 2023, Munich Re has switched the corresponding 
contracts to alternative interest rates; in other instances, 
fallback arrangements embedded in the contracts  
have entered into force."
"This did not result in any material 
economic impact."
"We have identified the significant risks from the transition 
to the new interest rates and already taken the necessary 
countermeasures in recent years."
"We therefore expect the 
reform of the remaining benchmark interest rates to have 
only a minor impact."
"The contracts that fall under these 
arrangements already contain clauses that guarantee a 
market-related transition or will be replaced at the date  
of discontinuation of the interest rate concerned at market 
conditions prevailing at that point."
"The table below shows the carrying amounts of financial 
instruments with benchmark interest rates that have not 
yet changed."
"In the 2023 reporting year, preparations 
advanced with regard to changing these interest rates."
"The 
table includes the most important reference rates."
"However, 
rates that had already been changed as at the end of the 
reporting period are no longer listed in the table for the 
2023 financial year."
"We have therefore not calculated any specific 
sensitivities to IFRS equity in accordance with IFRS 7 and 
IFRS 17."
"We regularly determine how sensitively the basic own 
funds, the solvency capital requirement and ultimately also 
the solvency ratio react to strong changes in specific capital 
market parameters and in other defined stress scenarios."
"The impact of selected scenarios on the solvency ratio of 
Munich Re as at 31 December 2023 and in the previous year 
is shown in the charts below."
"The Atlantic Hurricane 
scenario is a 1-in-200-year loss of basic own funds."
"The ultimate forward rate is not adjusted for the risk-free 
interest-rate curve sensitivities."
"For all evaluated sensitivities, Munich Re’s solvency ratio at 
Group level remains very comfortably above the target 
corridor of 175–220%."
"Overall, the results show a consistent 
picture compared to the previous year."
"53 Disclosures on further risks from 
insurance contracts 
Significant risks from the insurance contracts comprise 
underwriting risk, market risk, liquidity risk and default  
risk."
"These risks are described in detail in the Combined 
management report > Risk report."
"We measure and manage underwriting risks, split into 
property-casualty and life and health, market risks and 
default risks associated with insurance contracts as part  
of credit risk using our full internal model, which calculates 
the capital requirements under Solvency II."
"Using 
diversification effects, this process also takes account of 
the interplay with other risks such as operational risks and 
asset-based risks."

institutions for occupational retirement provision.
"Liquidity risks are not included when calculating the 
Solvency II capital requirements."
"We quantify our liquidity 
risks from insurance contracts based on maturity analyses of 
net cash flows and the monitoring of the amounts payable 
on demand at short notice, see “Liquidity risk”."
"The disclosures below describe the individual characteristics 
of the risks in our life and health insurance business and in 
our property-casualty insurance business."
"Underwriting risks 
The particular underwriting risks in the life and health 
insurance business include biometric risk, lapse risk and 
accumulation risk."
"Biometric risks mainly relate to mortality, 
disability, morbidity and longevity."
"The biometric assumptions 
we use for measuring insurance contracts in our portfolios 
are regularly reviewed on the basis of updated portfolio 
information."
"Especially in primary insurance, this includes 
considering country-specific reviews by supervisory 
authorities."
"We also take account of market standards 
when checking the adequacy of biometric actuarial 
assumptions and the trend assumptions included in them."
"In reinsurance, a lapse risk also derives from the indirect 
transfer of lapse risks from cedants."
"As a rule, both this  
risk and the financial risk from extraordinary termination  
of reinsurance contracts are largely ruled out through 
appropriate contract design."
"The lapse risk in primary 
insurance is allowed for by means of appropriate liquidity 
planning and adequate calculation of the surrender value."
"Accumulation risk describes the situation of multiple risks 
being affected by the same loss event."
"In the context of our 
life and health insurance business, the accumulation risk 
includes the occurrence of a severe pandemic."
"We counter 
this risk by examining our overall exposure in detail using 
scenario analysis, and by deploying appropriate measures 
to manage the risks."
"In property-casualty insurance business, underwriting risks 
include premium, reserve and accumulation risk."
"Premium 
risk is the risk of future claims payments relating to insured 
losses that have not yet occurred being higher than expected."
"Reserve risk relates to the liability for incurred claims, 
which is subject to the risk that actual claims settlement 
may be less than or exceed the amount reserved."
"We define natural catastrophes as one of the greatest 
accumulation risks in property-casualty insurance 
business."
"To manage this underwriting risk, we develop 
well-founded scientific models that allow us to quantify 
occurrence probabilities and loss potentials."
"Market risk 
Our main market risk exposure with regard to our insurance 
liabilities is interest-rate risk."
"A distinction must be made 
between risks of changes in interest rates on the one hand 
and interest-rate guarantee risks on the other, with interest-
rate risks primarily affecting our life and health insurance 
business."
"Moreover, our segments are exposed to the risks 
of inflation."
"Risks of changes in interest rates result from the discounting 
of the liability for remaining coverage and of the liability for 
incurred claims."
"Economically, an interest-rate risk derives 
in principle from the need to earn a return on the investments 
covering the liabilities that is commensurate with the discount 
rate used in measuring the liabilities."
"The interest-rate 
curves used for discounting are presented under Notes on 
insurance contracts > 48 Yield curves for major currencies."
"In life primary insurance, an implicit or explicit interest-rate 
guarantee is granted for the majority of contracts over their 
whole duration, based on a fixed interest rate applying at the 
time the contract is concluded."
"This exposes the insurance to 
an interest-guarantee risk."
"An appropriate minimum return 
needs to be earned in the long term from the investment 
result (possibly also with assistance from the insurance 
service result) for the contractually guaranteed services."
"Given that the investments, as a rule, have a shorter duration 
than the insurance commitments, there is a reinvestment 
risk."
"As regards premiums yet to be received, the investment 
of these amounts involves a certain amount of risk."
"Our life 
primary insurers take the capital market conditions into 
 
 
Consolidated financial statements

account in their asset-liability management."
"They address 
the attendant risks by pursuing an investment strategy that 
is geared to the long term and also comprises derivative 
financial instruments."
"The prolonged phase of low interest rates was recently 
followed by a significant recovery on the interest-rate market."
"We factor in the effects on our long-term investment 
strategy and derivative financial instruments in the context 
of our asset-liability management."
"In long-term health primary insurance, a discount rate is also 
used for calculating the liability for remaining coverage."
"However, this rate can generally be altered by way of 
premium adjustment."
"For short-term business, there is no 
direct interest-rate risk."
"Other market risks are of particular 
importance to unit-linked life insurance policies and to the 
lump-sum option in the case of deferred annuity policies."
"For the unit-linked life insurance contracts in our portfolio, 
the investments are held for the benefit of life insurance 
policyholders who bear the investment risk, meaning that 
there is no direct market risk."
"Appropriate product design 
ensures that the necessary premium portions for payment 
of a guaranteed minimum benefit on occurrence of death 
are based on the current fund assets."
"The lump-sum option in the case of deferred annuity 
policies gives policyholders the option of having their 
annuity paid out in a single payment at a fixed date."
"As  
a result, there is a potential risk of an unexpectedly large 
number of policyholders exercising their option at an 
interest-rate level markedly higher than the discount rate 
used for the annuity calculation."
"But there is no direct 
interest-rate sensitivity or market sensitivity, since the 
exercise of the option by the policyholder is determined  
to a crucial extent by individual factors and relates to the 
insurance components."
"Some primary insurance and reinsurance contracts contain 
derivative components of variable annuities."
"These are 
measured separately from the underlying contract and their 
changes in value are recognised in the result from insurance-
related financial instruments."
"We take inflation-rate developments into consideration in 
our estimates of insurance liabilities by means of standard 
actuarial methods and our experienced-based reserving 
approach."
"Liquidity risk 
For Munich Re, there could be a liquidity risk if the cash 
outflow for insurance claims payments and the costs 
related to the business were to exceed the cash inflow from 
premiums and investments."
"The tables below for life and 
health and for property-casualty insurance business 
respectively provide details of the expected future cash 
outflows for our insurance contracts issued that are 
liabilities and reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities."
"With these numerical estimates, it should be borne in mind 
that this forward-looking data may involve considerable 
uncertainty."
"The amounts from portfolios of insurance contracts issued 
that are liabilities and that are payable on demand primarily 
include surrender values in German life primary insurance."
"In the ERGO Life and Health Germany and ERGO 
International segments, the amounts from insurance contracts 
issued that are liabilities and that are payable on demand 
come to €52,793m (35,377m) in the current financial year."
"We report a carrying amount of €74,369m (69,476m) for the 
corresponding contract portfolios that are liabilities."
"Amounts payable on demand from insurance contracts 
issued that are liabilities come to €189m (207m) in the 
property-casualty reinsurance segment in the current 
financial year."
"We report a carrying amount of €18,794m 
(16,961m) for the corresponding contract portfolios 
portfolios that are liabilities."
"These amounts payable on 
demand largely result from reinsurance contracts where 
the cedant is entitled to have the claims deposit paid out."
"It should be noted that these are shown without the 
corresponding outflows: netting agreements and 
cancellations permitted due to the deterioration in 
creditworthiness which counteract the credit default."
These significantly reduce the actual credit default risk.
"Any shortfall in future cash flows generally means a 
reduction in the contractual service margin."
"The information on the credit quality of the present value of 
future payments from reinsurance contracts held that are 
assets is based on the counterparty’s rating by the leading 
international rating agencies."
"If more than one rating is 
available from different rating agencies, we use the second-
highest rating for the overall assessment of the counterparty’s 
expected inflows."

The obligations from legal disputes totalled €4m (4m).
Other contingent liabilities amounted to €1m (0m).
"Like the evaluation process for other provisions, the 
assessment is made by experts in the affected units on the 
basis of the best estimate."
"Contingent liabilities are disclosed 
if there is only a potential obligation or there is a present 
obligation for which it is, however, deemed unlikely that an 
outflow of resources will occur, or it is not possible to make a 
sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation."
"ERGO companies have assumed unlimited liability for the 
sale of insurance products by insurance intermediaries 
acting exclusively on their behalf."
"In this respect, there is a 
risk of a claim being made by customers."
"In case of a claim, 
there is generally a possibility of recourse against the 
insurance intermediary or the latter’s fidelity guarantee 
insurance carrier."
"The application of fiscal regulations may yet be unresolved at 
the time of calculation of tax refund claims and tax 
liabilities."
"The calculation of tax items is based on the 
regulations most likely to be applied in each case."
"Regardless of this, the tax authorities may take a different 
view, which may give rise to additional tax liabilities."
"In accordance with the German Insurance Supervision Act 
(VAG), all German life and health insurers of our Group are 
obliged to be members of a protection fund."
"For life insurers, 
the protection fund can levy special contributions of up to 
one per mille of total net technical provisions, in addition to 
a regular contribution of 0.2 per mille of total net technical 
provisions."
"For the health insurers, there is no pre-financing, 
but the fund may levy special contributions of up to two per 
mille of net technical provisions to fulfil its functions."
"This 
could give rise to a potential payment obligation of €159m 
(169m) at Group level."
"The functions and powers of the 
statutory protection fund for life insurance rest with Protektor 
Lebensversicherungs-AG, and those of the statutory 
protection fund for health insurance with Medicator AG."
"Munich Re is a member of the German Nuclear Reactor 
Insurance Association (DKVG) and the Pharma Reinsurance 
Community."
"If another member of these pools is not able  
to meet their payment obligations, we may be held liable 
for a proportional share of their obligations."
"However, we 
consider the risk of such a liability arising to be remote."
"Besides this, Munich Re has entered into various other 
financial obligations amounting to €1,429m (1,259m) for 
work and service contracts – and €2,667m (2,699m) for 
investment obligations, of which €9m (31m) is from our

"At the end of the reporting 
period, there were loan commitments amounting to  
€24m (2,008m)."
"In addition, loan commitments that were

per IFRS 9 – provided the financial instruments added later 
are accounted for at fair value."
"There are other financial

"Munich Re has no other financial commitments of 
significance for the assessment of its financial position."
"No contingent liabilities have been entered into for the 
benefit of Board members."
"63 Significant restrictions 
Regulatory, legal or contractual restrictions and protective 
rights of non-controlling interests may restrict the Group’s 
ability to access or use assets, and settle liabilities."
"The carrying amounts of Group assets with restrictions  
on title can be found in the Notes to the consolidated 
balance sheet – Assets."
"Individual national regulations require that assets held to 
cover insurance liabilities be managed separately."
"Generally 
there are special supervisory regulations governing access 
to these assets and their use."
"In addition, we are subject to supervisory requirements  
that may restrict dividend payments or other capital 
distributions, loans and advance payments within the

"322(3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that 
our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of 
the combined management report."
"Basis for the opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and of the combined management report in 
accordance with Sec."
"317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation 
(No."
"537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit 
Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute 
of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities 
under those requirements and principles are further 
described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements and of the combined 
management report” section of our auditor’s report."
"In addition, in accordance with Art."
"10(2)(f)  
of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not 
provided non-audit services prohibited under Art."
"5(1) of the 
EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the audit evidence  
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  
a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the combined management report."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 
1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023."
"These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters."
"Determining the present value of the expected future cash 
flows is a key aspect of measuring the liability for remaining 
coverage."
"Future cash flows include all cash flows required to fulfil 
the contractual obligations within the contract boundary 
such as premium payments, benefit payments as well as 
administration and acquisition costs."
"They make up the 
greatest part of measuring the liability for remaining 
coverage."
"IFRS 17 requires an entity-specific estimate of all 
future cash flows."
"Entities shall incorporate all information 
available without undue cost or effort."
"The estimates shall 
be updated at each measurement date."
"Estimation of future cash flows is subject to considerable 
judgement."
"Future cash flows are projected using actuarial 
models, factoring in a large number of possible scenarios  
and using assumptions on the future development of 
economic and non-economic variables."
"These include, in 
particular, assumptions relating to mortality, disability and 
morbidity, as well as interest-rate development, lapse rates, 
acquisition and administration costs, and inflation."
"The 
determination or revision of the assumptions is frequently 
subject to uncertainty, particularly because the assumptions 
are generally not based on observable market inputs."
"In 
primary insurance, management rules that are made 
depending on the development of the portfolio of investments 
and insurance contracts are also reflected in the scenarios."
The projections generally extend over a long time horizon.
"Under IFRS 17, an entity shall discount the estimate of 
future cash flows in order to reflect the time value of money."
"The discount rates used shall be updated at each 
measurement date."
"Discount rates are determined using a bottom-up approach, 
with the Solvency II interest rate curves published by the 
European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority 
(EIOPA) serving as the starting point for risk-free interest 
rates."
"Credit risks are not taken into account in the 
discount rates used."
"In light of the uncertainty and the use of judgement in 
estimating future cash flows and determining the discount 
rates, there is a risk of incorrect measurement of the liability 
for remaining coverage."
"We therefore determined this to be 
a key audit matter."
"Auditor’s response 
As part of our audit, we analysed the processes for estimating 
future cash flows and determining discount rates for risks 
of errors."
"Independent auditor’s report 
318 
 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
We also performed substantive procedures to obtain an 
understanding of the model used for cash flow determination."
"Moreover, for a risk-based sample, we examined whether 
selected data were correctly included in the model calculation 
by reconciling them with the contract management systems."
"In addition, we assessed the plausibility of the assumptions 
underlying the model and checked the validations performed 
in this context for a risk-based sample."
"We checked the 
suitability of the scenario generator used for the assumed 
capital market scenarios and analysed the validation 
results."
"We also checked the appropriateness of the 
management rules and their derivation on a sample basis."
"We 
then analysed the calculated future cash flows for anomalies."
"For primary life insurance business, we assessed the 
appropriateness of the estimates of future cash flows on the 
basis of the analysis, control and validation files provided."
"In addition, we checked whether fixed and variable 
overheads were allocated to the groups of insurance 
contracts using systematic and rational methods."
"We obtained an understanding of the method used to derive 
the discount rates to assess its suitability."
"In particular, we 
analysed the risk-free interest rates used and, where 
applicable, the illiquidity premiums applied."
"Where discount 
rates were derived for periods for which no risk-free interest 
rates were observable on the market, we checked the 
extrapolation of a long-term risk-free interest rate curve 
(ultimate forward rate)."
"We also assessed the application of 
the discount rates derived using the bottom-up approach to 
the actuarial models."
We used our own actuaries in the course of our audit.
"Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to 
the determination of the present value of expected future 
cash flows in the context of measuring the liability for 
remaining coverage."
"In addition, the use of 
estimates and assumptions is explained in the section 
Accounting policies – Use of judgements and estimates in 
recognition and measurement."
"Estimating future cash flows includes all cash flows for 
incurred claims that have not yet been settled such as 
claims payments, claims settlement expenses and 
administration costs."
"IFRS 17 requires an entity-specific 
estimate of all future cash flows."
"Entities shall incorporate 
all information available without undue cost or effort."
"The 
estimates shall be updated at each measurement date."
"Estimation of future cash flows is subject to considerable 
judgement."
"Future cash flows are projected using actuarial 
models, considering past experience and assumptions 
about future developments, including social, economic  
or technological factors."
"Expected future claims payments 
are estimated on the basis of historical observations for the 
entity’s own portfolio (settlement patterns) and, if necessary, 
with reference to external reference data and expert 
estimates."
"In this context, past experience is used as a basis 
for making assumptions about future premiums and ultimate 
loss ratios, as well as the time frames, factors, speed of 
claims settlement, and inflation of claims."
"The assessment 
of major losses is considered separately."
"Under IFRS 17, an entity shall discount the estimate of 
future cash flows in order to reflect the time value of money."
"The discount rates used shall be updated at each 
measurement date, using different interest rates as a 
reference for the update depending on the measurement 
model."
"Under the general measurement model, current 
interest rates are used as a reference, while the premium 
allocation approach uses the interest rates relevant at the 
date of the incurred claim."
"Independent auditor’s report 
319 
 
 
Munich Re Group Annual Report 2023 
Discount rates are determined using a bottom-up approach, 
with the Solvency II interest rate curves published by EIOPA 
serving as the starting point for risk-free interest rates."
"Credit risks are not taken into account in the discount 
rates used."
"IFRS 17 requires a risk adjustment for non-financial risk to 
be added to the present value of the expected future cash 
flows to account for the uncertainty about the amount and 
timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk."
"The risk adjustment for non-financial risk shall be updated 
at each measurement date."
"The determination of the risk adjustment for non-financial 
risk using the cost-of-capital method is derived from the 
internal Solvency II risk model and takes into account 
Group-wide risk diversification."
"In light of the uncertainty and the use of judgement in 
estimating future cash flows and determining the discount 
rates as well as the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, 
there is a risk of incorrect measurement of the liability for 
incurred claims in property-casualty insurance business."
We therefore determined this to be a key audit matter.
"Auditor’s response 
As part of our audit, we analysed the processes for estimating 
future cash flows and for determining discount rates as well 
as the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for risks of 
errors."
"For the estimation of future cash 
flows, this included in particular the assessment of the 
methodology applied as well as the derivation of entity-
specific assumptions on the basis of historical claims 
development as well as assumptions on administration 
costs and claims settlement expenses."
"We also performed substantive procedures to assess the 
suitability of the actuarial techniques and statistical methods 
applied as well as the derivation and plausibility of key 
assumptions used, including loss ratios and assumptions  
with regard to claims settlement."
"For the purpose of 
assessing the quality of estimates, we analysed the actual 
development of the previous year’s liability for incurred 
claims based on the run-off results."
"We also generated our own loss projections for the 
estimates of future cash flows for a risk-based selection of 
lines of business applying mathematical and statistical 
methods."
"We first calculated our best estimate and defined 
a range based on statistical probabilities, and then compared 
these with management’s calculations."
"We checked the calculation of the provisions for major losses 
for a systematic sample, taking into account the information 
and data available at the end of the reporting period."
"With regard to measurement of the provisions for asbestos 
and environmental liability claims, we obtained an 
understanding of the procedures for validating the provisioned 
amount and certain methods and reconciled the comparative 
figures used with externally available market studies."
"We assessed the derivation of the assumptions on the 
development of the consumer price, construction cost, 
wage growth and medical inflation indices, and the impacts 
thereof on the entire portfolio."
"Based on a random sample, 
we assessed the correct use of portfolio-specific inflation 
assumptions."
"In addition, we checked whether fixed and variable 
overheads were allocated to the groups of insurance 
contracts using systematic and rational methods."
"We obtained an understanding of the method used to derive 
the discount rates to assess its suitability."
"In particular, we 
analysed the risk-free interest rates used and, where 
applicable, the illiquidity premiums applied."
"Where discount 
rates were derived for periods for which no risk-free interest 
rates were observable on the market, we checked the 
extrapolation of a long-term risk-free interest rate curve 
(ultimate forward rate)."
"We also assessed the application of 
the discount rates derived using the bottom-up approach to 
the actuarial models."
"We obtained an understanding of the method used to 
derive the risk adjustment for non-financial risk to assess 
its suitability, and evaluated the derivation and plausibility 
of key assumptions used, including the Group-wide risk 
diversification."
"Moreover, we analysed the change in the 
risk adjustment for non-financial risk."
We used our own actuaries in the course of our audit.
"Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating  
to the measurement of the liability for incurred claims in 
property-casualty insurance business."
"In addition, the use of 
estimates and assumptions is explained in the section 
Accounting policies – Use of judgements and estimates in 
recognition and measurement."
"Risk disclosures are 
included in the section Disclosures on risks from financial 
instruments and insurance contracts (53) Disclosures on 
further risks from insurance contracts of the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements and in the Risk report 
section of the combined management report."
"Valuation of unlisted investments 
 
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key  
audit matter 
The fair values of unlisted investments are mainly 
determined by using valuation models or values assessed by 
third parties."
"The primary parameters used are observable 
market inputs, such as interest rate curves based on the 
underlying terms and credit spreads."
"This applies particularly 
to the fair value measurement of unlisted fixed-interest 
debt instruments (registered bonds, borrower’s note loans, 
infrastructure loans and other loans) and derivatives."
"In 
addition, unobservable inputs are used to measure certain 
investments – particularly real estate, real estate funds, 
investments in private equity funds, and alternative direct 
investments (such as infrastructure)."
"The valuation models 
selected and the assumptions about inputs defined are 
judgemental."
"The greater the number of inputs used that 
are not observable in the market but are instead based on 
internal estimates, the greater the scope for judgement."
"This matter was determined to be a key audit matter due to 
the judgements used in selecting the valuation models and 
the assumptions to be made with regard to the significant 
inputs."
"Moreover, unlisted investments contribute a 
substantial share of the investments in the consolidated 
balance sheet."
"Auditor’s response 
As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the 
processes for the valuation of unlisted investments."
"We  
also tested the effectiveness of the controls integrated in 
the processes and designed to ensure the full and correct 
selection and recording of inputs as well as to ensure the 
correct application of the valuation models used."
"We assessed whether the valuation models used ensured  
a reliable determination of fair values."
"For a risk-based sample of unlisted fixed-interest debt 
instruments, we performed our own fair value calculations 
using independently determined valuation-relevant inputs 
(interest rate curves and spreads)."
"We compared the results 
with management’s valuations."
"We performed our own fair value calculations for derivatives 
on a sample basis and compared them with the fair values 
determined by management."
"Moreover, we checked the fair value measurements of 
alternative direct investments for a risk-based sample and 
assessed the calculation parameters used, considering the 
investment-specific circumstances."
"We compared the fair 
values of sub-portfolios of indirectly held real estate invest-
ments and of investments in private equity funds with 
external information."
"For directly held real estate investments, 
we checked the valuations for a risk-based sample."
"Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to 
the valuation of unlisted investments."
"Reference to related disclosures 
The disclosures on the accounting policies applied are 
included in the sections Overarching accounting policies – 
Fair value and Assets – D Investments of the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements."
"In addition, the use of 
estimates and assumptions is explained in the section 
Accounting policies – Use of judgements and estimates in 
recognition and measurement."
"Risk disclosures on market risk and 
credit risk are included in the section Disclosures on risks 
from financial instruments and insurance contracts 
(51) Disclosures on risks from financial instruments in the 
Risk report section of the combined management report."
"Other information 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for the report of the 
Supervisory Board."
"Management and the Supervisory 
Board are responsible for the Declaration of Conformity 
with the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to 
Sec."
"161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which 
is part of the Group Statement on Corporate Governance, 
as well as for the remuneration report pursuant to Sec."
"162 
of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"Management 
is otherwise responsible for the other information."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and 
on the combined management report do not cover the other 
information, and consequently we do not express an opinion 
or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude  
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact."
"We have 
nothing to report in this regard."
"315e(1) HGB and that the consolidated 
financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and financial performance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have  
the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible 
for financial reporting based on the going concern basis  
of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate  
the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic 
alternative but to do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the 
Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of 
the consolidated financial statements and of the combined 
management report."
"Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
Sec."
"317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance 
with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial 
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschafts- 
prüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements and this combined management report."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit."
"The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud  
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control."
"− Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
by management and the reasonableness of estimates made 
by management and related disclosures."
"− Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements and in the combined management 
report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
respective opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"− Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated 
financial statements and on the combined management 
report."
"We are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the Group audit."
"We remain solely 
responsible for our opinions."
"− Evaluate the consistency of the combined management 
report with the consolidated financial statements, its 
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s 
position it provides."
"− Perform audit procedures on the prospective information 
presented by management in the combined management 
report."
"We  
do not express a separate opinion on the prospective 
information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events 
will differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters."
"We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter."
