"Following the acquisition of 25% plus 
one share of the ordinary shares of Porsche AG, the focus this year was on continuing to develop 
our financial and investment strategy."
"One important part of this was the repayment and long-term 
financing of our financial debt."
"We accomplished this in an impressive manner with the placement of 
a Schuldschein loan in a record amount of around 2.7 billion euro and bond placements totaling  
2.0 billion euro."
"These successful issuances underline the high level of confidence that we enjoy 
among long-term investors, also in the debt capital market."
"Our business developed positively in 2023: The group result after tax of Porsche SE amounted to 
5.1 billion euro."
"This group result after tax was significantly influenced by the result of our core 
investments in Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG accounted for at equity of 4.8 billion euro and  
0.4 billion euro, respectively."
"Overall, Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG achieved good results 
despite the continuing difficult economic situation due to the war in Ukraine, ongoing supply chain 
issues and above-average inflation."
"Porsche SE consistently supports the strategic orientation of 
both Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG."
"We are convinced that these two core investments will 
successfully drive forward the transformation of the automotive industry."
"The net debt position of the Porsche SE Group decreased to 5.7 billion euro as of 31 December 
2023, compared to 6.7 billion euro as of 31 December 2022."
"In addition to the dividends from our 
core investments Volkswagen and Porsche AG, Porsche SE received tax-related refunds of around 
500 million euro."
"This has further strengthened our liquidity position and increased the financial 
headroom to repay financial debt and make value-increasing investments."
"In order to maintain a 
sound financial profile, we continue to focus on an investment grade profile."
"In the long term, we 
aim to achieve a low double-digit loan-to-value ratio."
"In the portfolio investments segment, we have made further investments in companies in the 
mobility and industrial technology sector."
"Amongst others, our portfolio companies also serve the 
growth markets for electrified and connected mobility and high-performance computing."
We were successful on the legal side as well.
"In March 2023, the Higher Regional Court of 
Stuttgart issued a model case ruling in a capital markets model case in connection with the diesel 
issue."
"In its ruling, the Higher Regional Court did not side with the plaintiffs and the establishment 
objectives sought against Porsche SE were overwhelmingly not made."
"On the basis of the 
establishments objectives made in the model case ruling and the current status of the matter in 
dispute in the initial proceedings, all investor claims against Porsche SE are expected to be 
dismissed."
The ruling is not yet legally binding.
"We also aim to further reduce the group’s net debt 
by 31 December 2024."
"The group’s net debt is estimated to amount to between 5.0 billion euro 
and 5.5 billion euro."
"As in prior years, the board of management and the supervisory board would like you, our 
shareholders, to participate in our company’s success."
"We continue to pursue a dividend policy 
based on reliability and stability."
"For the fiscal year 2023, we therefore propose a dividend of  
2.56 euro per share to be distributed to the holders of preference shares and of 2.554 euro per 
share to the holders of ordinary shares."
This is equivalent to a total distribution of 783 million euro.
Porsche SE pursues the overarching goal of creating sustainable value for our shareholders.
"This 
requires investing in companies that contribute to the mid- and long-term profitability of the 
Porsche SE Group."
"At the same time, we want to ensure the availability of sufficient liquidity 
reserves."
"Our existing core investments in Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG make a significant 
contribution to this."
"In the long term, we will expand our investment activities and further develop 
Porsche SE as an investment platform."
"This also includes intensifying our partnerships with 
leading global investors."
"Diversifying the investment portfolio will increase the resilience of 
Porsche SE."
"Annual investments in the low triple-digit million range are planned for the further expansion of 
the portfolio investments segment."
"In addition to the mobility and industrial technology sectors, 
we will also be investing in related areas."
"Sustainability aspects are an integral part of our 
corporate governance and the strategy of the Porsche SE Group."
"Our strong group result, the positive development of net debt and the successful investments 
show that we have successfully developed Porsche SE in the past year."
"We will consistently 
pursue this path in 2024."
"While doing so, Porsche SE continues to count on your trust and 
support."
"Despite these geopolitical uncertainties and 
economic challenges, the international stock markets 
posted strong gains in 2023, particularly in the fourth 
 
 
 
quarter."
"Stock markets rallied at the end of the year 
on the prospect of lowered key interest rates and 
confidence that a recession in the USA could be 
avoided."
"Technology stocks in particular posted 
significant gains."
"From this point onwards, a downward 
trend set in, which ended on 27 October with an 
annual low of 14,687.41 points."
"In expectation of 
falling interest rates, the DAX experienced a 
dynamic price rally from November onwards, 
reaching its annual high of 16,794.43 in December."
"At the end of the year, it recorded growth of around 
20% compared to the closing price in 2022 
(13,923.59 points) and stood at 16,751.64 points."
"The Euro Stoxx 50 closed 2023 at 4,521.65 points, 
an increase of around 19% compared to the closing 
price for 2022 (3,793.62 points)."
"The annual high of 
4,549.44 points was recorded on 15 December 
2023."
"The annual low of 3,793.62 points was  
recorded on 2 January 2023."
"The price of the Porsche SE preference share hit  
an annual high of €59.76 on 8 March 2023."
"On 
31 October 2023, it reached its annual low of 
€42.15."
"At year-end 2023, the share price stood at 
€46.32, down 11% compared to the prior year 
(€51.24), after recovering from its low in the last two 
months of 2023 and increasing by around 10%."
"This is the sum of the market 
values of all investments, taking net debt into 
account."
"Holding companies such as Porsche SE 
are generally valued slightly lower by the capital 
market than the sum of their investments."
"This is 
referred to as the holding discount."
"The holding 
discount of Porsche SE is calculated as the 
difference between its net asset value and its 
current market capitalization."
"As of 31 December 2023, the net asset value of 
Porsche SE amounted to around €23 billion."
"The 
market capitalization of Porsche SE at the end of 
the year was around €14 billion."
"This equates to a 
holding discount of around 39%."
"This gives 
investors the opportunity to invest in attractive 
assets via Porsche SE at a discount."
"The 
shareholders resolved to distribute a dividend of 
€2.56 per preference share and of €2.554 per 
ordinary share for the fiscal year 2022."
"Unchanged 
compared to the prior year, this represents a total 
payout of €783 million."
"The shareholders also reelected current supervisory 
board members Mag."
"Josef Michael Ahorner,  
Mag."
"Marianne Heiß, Dr. Günther Horvath and  
Peter Daniell Porsche for a further term of office and 
elected Sophie Piëch to the supervisory board for 
the first time."
"The members of the board of management and 
those of the supervisory board holding office in the 
fiscal year 2022 were exonerated."
"The proposed 
amendment to the articles of association that allows 
the board of management of Porsche SE to hold 
annual general meetings virtually for the next five 
years was unanimously adopted."
"Dividend 
The board of management of Porsche SE enables 
shareholders to participate in the company’s 
success via the dividend."
"For the fiscal year 2023, 
the board of management and supervisory board 
propose an unchanged dividend compared to the 
prior year of €2.560 per share to be distributed to 
the holders of preference shares and of €2.554 per 
share to the holders of ordinary shares."
"This is 
equivalent to a total distribution of €783 million."
"The 
annual general meeting, which will take place on 
11 June 2024, will decide on the dividend proposal."
"According to the information available to 
Porsche SE, the ordinary shares are indirectly held 
 
 
 
exclusively by members of the Porsche and Piëch 
families."
"More than half of the preference shares are 
held by institutional investors – mainly with a 
principal office outside Germany."
"The further free 
float preference shares are distributed between 
private investors."
"Porsche SE is committed to 
comprehensive, prompt and open communication 
with private and institutional investors and financial 
analysts."
"Porsche SE’s investor relations work 
therefore complies with the transparency guidelines 
of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"It is 
particularly important to Porsche SE to treat all 
shareholders equally."
"Accordingly, communication 
with the capital market in 2023 took place in virtual 
formats and through face-to-face meetings on site."
"Communication with private investors took place 
primarily by telephone and via digital channels."
"The assessments of financial analysts are of great 
importance for both institutional and private 
investors when it comes to investment decisions."
"By the end of the fiscal year on 31 December 2023, 
nine analysts had issued a positive assessment of 
Porsche SE with a buy recommendation, four of 
which even issued a particularly strong buy 
recommendation."
"Six analysts favored a neutral 
position with a hold recommendation."
"Sustainability aspects and ESG topics are of central 
importance for the investor relations work."
"For 
instance, Porsche SE does not produce a printed 
version of its annual report for sustainability reasons."

"By utilizing the bridge loan of €3.9 billion and fixed-
term bank loans of €3.2 billion, Porsche SE initially 
drew down an amount of €7.1 billion."
"Over the fiscal 
year 2023, the bridge loan was repaid ahead of 
schedule through repayments and refinancing 
measures."
"At the end of the fiscal year 2023, liabilities from 
bank loans of €0.2 billion with a term of three years 
and €1.8 billion with a term of five years still exist 
from the original acquisition financing."

the undrawn revolving credit line of €1.0 billion is 
still available."

2026."
"Refinancing in the fiscal year 2023  
In the fiscal year 2023, Porsche SE carried out 
extensive refinancing measures with a total volume 
of €4.7 billion to replace the acquisition financing."

Porsche SE created broader access to new investor 
groups."
"Schuldschein loan 
 
In March 2023, Porsche SE placed a Schuldschein 
loan totaling €2.7 billion."
"The total volume is divided 
into eight tranches with terms of three, five, seven 
and ten years, for each of which fixed and variable 
interest rates were offered."
"A total of some 120 
institutional investors, including banks, pension 
funds and insurance companies, participated in the 
Schuldschein loan."
"The volume of €2.7 billion marks 
a new record on the promissory note market."
"Bonds 
 
For institutionalized access to the capital market  
on the debt side, Porsche SE established a bond 
program with a volume of €5 billion in April 2023."
"In 
April 2023, Porsche SE issued the first bond under 
this bond program."
"The bond was oversubscribed 
several times and was placed at attractive 
conditions with a volume of €750 million and a term 
until 2028."
"Based on the solid performance of the 
first bond and high demand on the secondary 
market, Porsche SE issued a further bond in June 
2023."
"The total volume of €1.25 billion is divided 
into two bonds with maturities of 2027 and 2030."
The terms of the bonds were also very attractive.

The executive committee prepares resolutions of the supervisory board on the remuneration 
system for the board of management as well as its regular review."
"In accordance with the

"This proposal is submitted to the supervisory board of 
Porsche SE for decision."

activities of the board of management members."
"In the past fiscal year, the audit committee regularly reviewed whether the risk early warning 
system in place is suitable for identifying at an early stage any developments jeopardizing the 
ability of the company to continue as a going concern."
"It satisfied itself as to the efficiency of the 
risk management system, including the internal control system, as well as the activities of internal 
audit and obtained regular reports on these."
"The audit committee was informed about changes in 
legal requirements."
"The audit committee passed its findings on to the entire supervisory board in 
regular reports."
"The audit committee’s review of accounting relates in particular to the annual and consolidated 
financial statements each supplemented by the combined management report."
"The audit 
committee deals with the half-yearly financial report and the group quarterly statements for the 
supervisory board and discusses them with the board of management and, in the case of the half-
yearly financial report, also with the independent auditor."
"As applicable, the audit committee also 
focuses on the non-financial group report, the dependent company report and the proposal for 
profit appropriation and prepares them for review by the supervisory board."
"In connection with the audit, the audit committee submits to the supervisory board a 
recommendation for the appointment of the auditor, which – except in cases where the auditor is 
reappointed – is prepared following a selection procedure within the meaning of Art."
"16 (3) 
Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, comprises at least two candidates and is explained."
"The audit 
committee recommended to the supervisory board that it propose to the annual general meeting, 
and thus reappoint, Grant Thornton AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf (“Grant 
Thornton AG”), as the auditor for the fiscal year 2024."

permissible by law as a preparatory committee."

committee on 25 September 2023 upon completion of Project Phoenix with acquisition of the 
investment in Porsche AG and conclusion of the corresponding financing agreements."
"At its meeting in the fiscal year 2023, the Phoenix committee primarily addressed the status of 
financing and interest rate hedging as well as the funding of the acquisition financing by placing a 
Schuldschein loan and issuing bonds."
"The executive committee and the audit committee each held four ordinary meetings in the fiscal 
year 2023."

Porsche AG."
"Corporate governance 
 
The supervisory board and board of management have repeatedly and intensively discussed the 
recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"In December 
2023, they submitted the annual declaration on conformity in accordance with Sec."
"161 AktG on 
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code and made it permanently 
accessible to shareholders on the company’s website at www.porsche-se.com/en/company/ 
corporate-governance/."
"The current declaration on conformity is reproduced in full in the 
declaration of compliance, as part of the combined management report."
"To the extent that concrete conflicts of interest exist or are feared, the particular conflict of interest 
is reported to the supervisory board by the member concerned."
"If a subsequent review finds that 
there is a conflict of interest, suitable measures are taken to resolve it."
"The specific measures 
depend on the type of conflict and the circumstances of the individual case."
"One conceivable 
option is that the supervisory board members concerned do not participate in the discussion of the 
relevant resolution or to abstain from voting."
"In the past fiscal year, conflicts of interest could not be 
ruled out in the case of resolutions of the company at the annual general meetings of Volkswagen 
AG and Porsche AG regarding the approval of the acts of members of the supervisory board of 
each company for the fiscal year 2022."
"If supervisory board members are also on the supervisory 
board of Volkswagen AG or Porsche AG, they abstained from voting in the resolutions on 
Porsche SE’s voting behavior in the annual general meeting of Volkswagen AG or Porsche AG 
regarding their own exoneration."
"Prior to the 
supervisory board issuing its recommendation for appointment to the annual general meeting, the 
auditor submitted a declaration of independence to the supervisory board, which was reviewed by 
the audit committee."
"The auditor issued an unqualified auditor’s report for both the annual financial statements and the 
consolidated financial statements (each supplemented by the combined management report) of 
Porsche SE for the fiscal year 2023."
"The audit committee discussed the audit risk assessment, the 
audit strategy, key audit matters and the audit planning with the auditor during preparations for the 
audit."
The audit committee also consulted with the auditor without the board of management.
"In 
the course of preparing for and performing the audit, the chairman of the audit committee regularly 
exchanged information with the auditor on the status of the audit, the provisional audit results and 
on the quality of the audit."
He reported on these exchanges in the committee.
"The auditors also 
attended both the audit committee meeting and the supervisory board meeting at which the annual 
and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report for the fiscal year 
2023 were discussed."
"In preparation, the members of the audit committee and supervisory board 
were provided with extensive documents and the audit reports of the auditor."
"The audit committee 
examined and discussed all reports made available to it and inquired about them in a critical 
manner."
These were also discussed in great detail in the presence of the auditor.
"The auditors 
reported on the results of their audits, also referring to the key audit matters, the respective 
procedures during the audit, including the conclusions and additional key topics set by the audit 
committee and were available to answer any additional questions or provide information."
"Furthermore, the auditor confirmed that the risk early warning system implemented by the board of 
management is suitable for identifying at an early stage any risks jeopardizing the ability of the 
company to continue as a going concern."
"After its own audit, the audit committee concurred with 
the result of the audits by the auditor."
"The chairman of the audit committee and the auditor reported on the results of their audits to the 
supervisory board and were available to answer any additional questions or provide information."
"After its own audit, the supervisory board concurred with the result of the auditor’s and audit 
committee’s audits."

Application of the board of management 
remuneration system 2021 
 
The board of management remuneration system 
2021 applied to all board of management service 
contracts in the reporting year 2023."
"When their 
contracts were extended, Dr. Döss and Mr. Pötsch 
were switched to the board of management 
remuneration system 2021 effective 1 January 2021 
and 1 January 2022, respectively."
"The board of 
management remuneration system 2021 had not 
previously applied for these two board of 
management members."
"For this reason, the 
remuneration components awarded for fiscal years 
up to and including 2020 that were paid out to 
Dr. Döss in the fiscal year 2023 are not yet based on 
the board of management remuneration system 
2021."
"For Mr. Pötsch, there were no special features 
for the reporting period from the former 
remuneration principles applying to his 
remuneration until the end of 2021."
"The board of management remuneration system 
2021 of Porsche SE is published at 
 
www.porsche-se.com/en/company/corporate-
governance/."
"Any former remuneration principles differing from 
the board of management remuneration system 
2021 that are of relevance for this remuneration 
report are explained separately."
"Unless noted 
separately, the information relates to the board of 
management remuneration system 2021."
"The appropriateness of the remuneration is 
assessed in particular in light of the tasks and 
performance of the individual board of management 
member and the situation of the company."
"Additionally, the supervisory board makes sure that 
the remuneration is aligned with the company’s 
long-term sustainable development and that 
customary remuneration is not exceeded unless 
there are special reasons."
"When determining what is 
customary, both the horizontal compatibility with 
peer group companies and the vertical compatibility 
with remuneration structures within Porsche SE are 
taken into account."
"The peer group used to assess the market 
conformity of the remuneration is identified with 
reference to the following criteria: market 
capitalization, total assets, location of the registered 
office and comparability of the industry sector."
"The relevant total 
workforce used for the purpose of the vertical 
comparison is the entire staff of Porsche SE below 
the board of management, i.e., including the first 
management level (but not including the employees 
of group companies) (the “total workforce”)."

"Components of board of management 
remuneration in the fiscal year 2023 
Fixed remuneration 
 
The fixed remuneration consists of the fixed salary, 
fringe benefits and, in principle, also pension 
benefits."
"The rationale for fixed and thus non-
performance-based remuneration is to provide the 
board of management members with an appropriate 
base income."
"In the supervisory board’s view, such 
base income reduces the likelihood that board of 
management members will take risks that are 
inappropriate from the company’s point of view."
"Fixed salary 
 
The fixed salary is cash-based remuneration set for 
the entire year that is paid out in twelve equal 
monthly installments."
"Fringe benefits 
 
In addition, each board of management member 
receives benefits in kind and other earnings (“fringe 
benefits”)."
"In particular, the following benefits are 
awarded as fringe benefits: 
· 
As a rule, each board of management member is 
provided with a company car, which may also be 
used for private purposes."
"Such a company car 
may not be provided, if the board of management 
member is already entitled to use a company 
vehicle based on a sideline activity for a third-
party company."
"The tax values are used to 
quantify the provision of a company car in the 
remuneration tables."
"· 
Each board of management member also has  
the possibility to use other company vehicles 
privately for a discounted usage charge according 
to the terms applicable to the first management 
level."
"· 
Each board of management member is entitled to 
continued payment of remuneration in the event 
of illness for no longer than twelve months."
"In the 
event of death, the surviving dependents are 
entitled to receive death grants equivalent to six 
monthly installments of the fixed salary."
"· 
The board of management members receive 
certain perks and benefits to a limited extent, 
equal to what is also awarded to the first 
management level from time to time."
"· 
Furthermore, Porsche SE bears the accommodation 
and food costs for staying at the location of the 
registered office of Porsche SE on the day  
before or after their business-related stay at 
Porsche SE’s registered office."
"The current chairman of the board of management 
is additionally allowed to travel by charter flight to 
and from the registered office of Porsche SE at the 
expense of Porsche SE in order to perform his tasks."
"The 
bonus consists of a short-term incentive (“STI”) and 
a long-term incentive (“LTI”)."
"The parameters for 
both components are for the most part identical."
"However, the long-term incentive is tied to 
additional long-term performance criteria, the 
payment of which depends on whether or not these 
are fulfilled (“payout hurdle”)."
"The aim of variable 
remuneration is to create incentives for 
implementing the corporate strategy in a 
sustainable way through targeted individual 
incentives for the board of management members 
and thus to promote Porsche SE as a profitable and 
competitive holding company."
"The performance targets for the bonus are set in 
individual target agreements concluded with the 
individual board of management members."
"The 
individual performance targets comprise primarily 
non-financial individual targets but may also be 
supplemented by financial performance targets 
related to that board of management member’s 
department and tasks."
"Besides the performance targets stipulated in  
the target agreement on an annual basis, a 
discretionary modifier is used to calculate the 
amount of the bonus."
"The basis for the calculation of the bonus is a target 
amount specified in the service contract, which is 
based on a target achievement of 100% (“bonus 
target amount”)."
"The total payment amount for the 
bonus is limited to 150% of the bonus target 
amount (“bonus cap”)."
"Where no provision is made for the 
measurability of target achievement, the supervisory 
board determines the degree of target achievement 
at its due discretion."
"In accordance with the relative weighting of the 
individual performance targets, an overall degree of 
target achievement is determined based on the 
individual levels of target achievement determined, 
on the basis of which an intermediate amount is 
calculated using the bonus target amount."
"In the event of extraordinary developments, the 
supervisory board may, at its reasonable discretion, 
increase or reduce the calculated total bonus 
amount by up to 20% by setting a special 
adjustment factor of 0.8 to 1.2; in that case, such  
an increase is not limited by the bonus cap."
"Target achievement and the total bonus amount 
(taking into account the modifier and special 
adjustment factor) are generally determined within 
three months of the end of the bonus-relevant fiscal 
year (“set total bonus amount”)."
"Short-term incentive 
 
A share of 40% of the set total bonus amount 
constitutes the STI, which, subject to any applicable 
malus mechanisms (see section “III."
"Compliance 
with remuneration ceiling”), is paid out three months 
after the end of the bonus-relevant fiscal year, but 
not before expiry of the third day following the day 
of the supervisory board meeting in which the 
consolidated financial statements of Porsche SE are 
approved."
"Long-term incentive 
 
A share of 60% of the set total bonus amount 
constitutes the LTI, which is retained for another two 
years after the end of the bonus-relevant fiscal year."
"It will be paid out after the end of the two-year 
deferral period unless any malus mechanisms  
(see section “III."
"Compliance with remuneration 
ceiling”) during the three-year assessment period 
(i.e., including the two-year deferral period) result in 
a forfeiture or reduction and only if the payout 
hurdle is met."
"The payout hurdle is met if, in the second fiscal year 
following the bonus-relevant fiscal year, a positive 
group result before tax or other group result before 
tax previously determined by the supervisory board 
is generated."
"If this payout hurdle is not reached, 
the entire LTI is forfeited."

any variable remuneration."
"Dr. Döss also received variable remuneration in 
accordance with the formerly applicable 
remuneration principles."
"The amount of variable 
remuneration was specified by the supervisory 
board at its discretion, taking into account the 
achievement of targets set in target agreements as 
well as the business and earnings situation of the 
company."
"40% of the variable remuneration set by 
the supervisory board for each completed fiscal 
year is due for payment three months after the fiscal 
year relevant for the bonus ends (short-term 
variable remuneration)."
"The remaining 60% is 
generally due for payment two years after the short-
term variable remuneration falls due (long-term 
variable remuneration)."
"Payment is largely 
dependent on the Porsche SE Group generating a 
positive group result before tax in the most recent 
fiscal year concluded before the long-term variable 
remuneration fell due."
"The LTI 
2020 long-term variable remuneration for Dr. Döss 
paid out in the reporting year is based on the former 
remuneration agreement."
"The variable remuneration for the former board of 
management member Mr. von Hagen paid out in the 
fiscal year 2023 was generally subject to the same 
former remuneration principles that were applied to 
Dr. Döss."
"However, as an additional disbursement 
requirement for the long-term variable remuneration, 
positive net liquidity1 of Porsche SE was required in 
addition to a positive group result after tax."
"In 
connection with Mr. von Hagen leaving the board of 
management of Porsche SE as of 30 June 2020, it 
was agreed that these disbursement requirements 
would no longer apply."

The pension schemes applicable to the board of 
management members vary depending on the date 
the member joined the board of management."
"Mr. Pötsch does not receive any company pension 
benefits from Porsche SE."
"Dr. Döss is awarded a salary-based retirement 
pension commitment that gives rise to a retirement 
pension entitlement equivalent to 25% of an agreed 
pensionable income."
"This increases by one 
percentage point for each active year of service as 
member of the board of management up to a 
maximum of 40%."
"As of 31 December 2023, Dr. Döss 
has reached a retirement pension entitlement of 33%."
"The retirement pension is payable after termination of 
the service contract when the board of management 
member reaches the age of 65 and if permanent 
inability to work occurs during the term of the service 
contract."
"The retirement pension is payable in twelve 
equal monthly installments."
"The surviving dependents’ 
pension comprises a widows’ pension of 60% of the 
retirement pension and orphans’ benefits of 20% of 
the retirement pension for each child, reduced to 10% 
for each child if a widow’s pension is paid."
"The total 
amount of the widows’ pension and orphans’ benefits 
must not exceed the amount of the retirement pension."
"Orphans’ benefits are limited to a total of 80% of the 
retirement pension."
"Dr. Döss will continue to be 
entitled to a company car after retirement."
"Dr. Lattwein and Mr. Meschke receive a direct

defined contribution benefit commitment, which will 
also be awarded to new members joining the board of

"Dr. Lattwein is entitled to an annual pension 
contribution of €270 thousand."
"Until 1 April 2023, 
Mr. Meschke was entitled to an annual pension 
contribution of €60 thousand."
"This was increased to 
€180 thousand following the amendment of the 
board of management service contract in the fiscal 
year."
"The increase in the pension contribution will 
apply pro rata temporis in the fiscal year 2023."
"The 
pension contribution is made on a pro rata basis for 
the year of joining as well as in the event of 
terminating the board of management service 
contract during the year."
"The pension contribution is 
paid for each year the service contract exists, but for 
no longer than until the member reaches the age of 62."

therefrom, contractual vesting applies with immediate

pensionable event occurs, the board of management 
member or their surviving dependents, as the case 
may be, will receive the pension capital as a one-time 
payment."

that he receives benefits from Porsche SE’s pension 
scheme directly after his service contract ends as a 
result of reaching retirement age."

"The general performance of the 
board of management members in the fiscal year

discretion provided this had not already been 
covered by the assessment of the individual targets."
"In the fiscal year 2023, Porsche SE’s capacities 
were particularly tied up with integration measures 
following the acquisition of the investment in 
Porsche AG, which Dr. Lattwein was also heavily 
involved in."
"Nevertheless, Dr. Lattwein was able to 
successfully conclude a highly complex tax project 
involving a refund of more than €200 million."
"This 
had not yet been taken into account in the targets 
set for Dr. Lattwein and resulted in a very positive 
result for Porsche SE in the fiscal year 2023."
"The 
supervisory board is therefore of the opinion that, in 
addition to his outstanding successes in the 
refinancing of Porsche SE, the highly complex tax 
project represents an extraordinary achievement by  
Dr. Lattwein during the year."
"To take account of this 
extraordinary achievement, the supervisory board 
used its due discretion to set a special adjustment 
factor of 1.1 for Dr. Lattwein."
"There were no 
extraordinary developments for Mr. Pötsch, Dr. Döss 
and Mr. Meschke in the fiscal year 2023, causing 
the variable remuneration to increase or decrease, 
meaning that the special adjustment factor was not 
applied."
"The payout hurdle for the LTI 2023 is met 
when a positive group result before tax is achieved 
in the fiscal year 2025."
"The increases will apply pro rata temporis in 
the fiscal year 2023."
"The LTIs earned but not yet paid out as of 
31 December 2023 comprised LTI components for 
the following fiscal years presented in the table 
below."
"They will be paid out after the end of a two-
year deferral period unless any malus mechanisms 
during the three-year assessment period (i.e., 
including the two-year deferral period) result in a 
forfeiture or reduction and only if the payout hurdle 
is met (see also section “III."
"Components of 
board of management remuneration in the fiscal 
year 2023”)."
"As a result of this, Mr. von Hagen receives long-term variable remuneration of €25 thousand (LTI 2021) for the period 
from 1 January 2021 to 28 February 2021."
"The originally planned determination/disbursement requirements for the variable remuneration 
(positive group result before tax and positive net liquidity of Porsche SE) no longer apply."
"Compliance with remuneration ceiling 
Maximum remuneration 
 
The supervisory board has set the maximum 
remuneration for the entire board of management  
at €24 million per year."
"The remuneration, some of which is conditional, 
earned by the entire board of management in the 
fiscal year 2023 totals €7 million and is therefore 
below the remuneration ceiling."
"In the fiscal year 2023, the supervisory board of 
Porsche SE did not retain or reclaim any variable 
remuneration components from individual members 
of the board of management."
"The prerequisites for a 
malus or clawback claim affecting variable 
remuneration components did not apply."
"The remuneration awarded
fiscal year 2023 thus amounted to
(€167 thousand), comprising 100
remuneration components."
"The LTI 2020 was determined by 
board in 2021 based on former re
principles (see section “III."

"A decision

f Mr. von Hagen’s 
individual performance."
"With regard to the LTI 
2020, the supervisory board awarded a bonus of  
€150 thousand (maximum bonus amount:  
€180 thousand)."
"The due date for payment is 
determined according to the usual points in time 
agreed in the service contract; the disbursement 
requirements (positive group result before tax and  
– in the case of the long-term variable remuneration – 
also positive net liquidity1 of Porsche SE) no longer 
apply."
"The former board of management member 
Mr. Müller was awarded remuneration of  
€14 thousand (€5 thousand) in the fiscal year 2023 
in the form of a car for private use, to which he is 
entitled in accordance with his former service 
contract."
"The remuneration is thus made up entirely 
of fixed remuneration components."
1 Negative net liquidity corresponds to net debt.
"As a 
result of this, in the fiscal year 2023, Mr. von Hagen 
received long-term variable remuneration of  
€150 thousand (€150 thousand) for the fiscal year 
2020."

on the basis of an assessment of Mr. von Hagen’s 
individual performance."
"With regard to the LTI 
2020, the supervisory board awarded a bonus of  
€150 thousand (maximum bonus amount:  
€180 thousand)."
"The due date for payment is 
determined according to the usual points in time 
agreed in the service contract; the disbursement 
requirements (positive group result before tax and  
– in the case of the long-term variable remuneration – 
also positive net liquidity1 of Porsche SE) no longer 
apply."
"The former board of management member 
Mr. Müller was awarded remuneration of  
€14 thousand (€5 thousand) in the fiscal year 2023 
in the form of a car for private use, to which he is 
entitled in accordance with his former service 
contract."
"The remuneration is thus made up entirely 
of fixed remuneration components."

Supervisory board remuneration system in the 
fiscal year 2023 
 
The remuneration of Porsche SE’s supervisory 
board members is governed by Art."
"13 of the 
articles of association and is described in the 
remuneration system for supervisory board 
members, which was confirmed by the annual 
general meeting in the fiscal year 2021."
"For their 
work, the members of the supervisory board 
exclusively receive fixed remuneration, the amount 
of which depends specifically on the tasks assumed 
on the supervisory board and its committees."
"According to the provisions set out in the articles  
of association, the annual basic remuneration is 
€150 thousand for the chairman of the supervisory 
board, €100 thousand for his deputy and  
€75 thousand for every other member of the 
supervisory board."
"The chairman of the audit 
committee receives an additional €100 thousand 
annually and every other member of the audit 
committee each receives an additional €50 thousand 
annually."
"For the activities undertaken on the 
committees other than the nominations committee 
and the investment committee (currently not 
established), the chairman receives an additional 
€50 thousand and every other member an additional 
€25 thousand each."
"If a member of the supervisory 
board holds more than two offices on committees at 
the same time, that member receives only the 
remuneration for the two most highly remunerated 
offices."
"Supervisory board members who are members of 
the supervisory board or of a committee or who act 
as (deputy) chairman for only a part of a fiscal year 
receive reduced remuneration proportionate to that 
period."
"The members of the supervisory board are also 
covered by a D&O insurance policy maintained by 
the company; the premiums of the D&O insurance 
are paid by Porsche SE."
"In addition, the company 
reimburses each supervisory board member for 
their expenses as well as for any value added tax 
legally owed on their remuneration or on the 
reimbursement of their expenses."
"The fixed remuneration is due and payable after 
each fiscal year ends."
"Expenses are to be 
reimbursed without undue delay."
"There are no 
further postponement periods for the payment of 
remuneration components."
"The remuneration system for the supervisory board 
is designed to allow the company to continue to 
attract and retain independent, qualified candidates 
with valuable specialist and industry-specific 
expertise for its supervisory board."
"This is a 
prerequisite for the supervisory board to engage in 
its advisory and monitoring activities in the best 
possible way."
"The remuneration is set and designed 
in a way that materially promotes the strategy and 
long-term development of Porsche SE."
"Sophie Piëch was elected to 
the supervisory board of Porsche SE for the first

The interests of various stakeholder groups of the

"To do so, 
Porsche SE uses, among other things, insights from 
investor inquiries and roadshows, analyst talks, the 
shareholder dialog with investments, appraisal 
interviews and press inquiries."
"As the qualifications, motivation and performance of 
Porsche SE’s employees are key success factors,

the sustainability strategy at holding level."
"In 
addition to promoting health and advanced training, 
the primary aim is to attract and retain qualified 
employees."
"Accordingly, Porsche SE intends to 
further establish itself as a top employer."

relevant at holding level."
"Porsche SE is fully

from the manufacturing or commodity- and energy-
intensive industries, environmental and social 
aspects are of little or no relevance at holding level."
"For example, the CO2 emissions1 caused exclusively

Due to a lack of control1, Porsche SE can only

"Porsche SE assumes the role of a 
responsible investor in order to strengthen the 
resilience of its investment portfolio in cooperation 
with its partners, also with regard to potential 
sustainability risks."
"Porsche SE’s corporate strategy 
centers around the investment strategy."
"Porsche 
SE’s sustainability strategy therefore also aims to 
take sustainability aspects into account in 
investment decisions."
"This is intended to mitigate 
potential risks in connection with the negative 
effects of business activities on the environment 
and society."
"Prior to acquiring investments, due diligence 
reviews are regularly carried out with the help of 
external consultants (including specialized 
sustainability consultants), which may also include 
sustainability aspects."
"Consideration of 
sustainability aspects is an integral part of the 
investment process and is enshrined in an internal 
company guideline."
"Porsche SE invests in sustainable business models 
and thus provides growth capital for its portfolio 
companies, which can contribute to the transition to 
a sustainable economy."
"Besides the two core 
investments, the Porsche SE Group has invested 
over the past few years in several companies that 
have significant sustainability aspects built into their 
business models."
"With their software solutions and 
their data portfolio, European Transport Solutions 
S.à r.l."
"aim to optimize traffic flows 
and transport routes, thereby making a significant 
contribution to reducing the consumption of 
resources and lowering emissions."
"A further 
example of contributing to sustainability are the 
innovative 3D printing solutions of our investments 
Markforged and Seurat Technologies, which allow 
for a more efficient use of resources in production 
and a reduction of emissions by shortening supply 
chains."
"Porsche SE also acquired shares in  
ABB E-mobility in the fiscal year 2023."
"With over 
50,000 DC fast chargers sold, the company has the 
largest installed base of fast chargers in the market."
"As one of the world’s leading suppliers of charging 
solutions for electric vehicles, ABB E-mobility 
makes an important contribution to growth in the 
area of electromobility."
"Porsche SE’s investments in private equity and 
venture capital funds are also allocated to the 
portfolio investments category."
"Funds subscribed to 
by Porsche SE are managed in accordance with 
sustainability-related investment guidelines and are 
classified at a minimum as an article 8 fund in 
accordance with the; SFDR [Regulation (EU) 
2019/2088 (Sustainable Finance Disclosure 
Regulation)]."
"Some of the funds are also aligned 
with explicit sustainability objectives in accordance 
with article 9 of the SFDR. 
Porsche SE supports the sustainability strategies of 
its core investments."
"Porsche SE is convinced that the Volkswagen 
Group will play a leading role in the transformation 
of the automotive industry and for this reason also 
has considerable potential for increasing value."
"These are based on 
extracts from the annual report as well as the 
sustainability report of the Volkswagen Group for 
the fiscal year 2023 and the annual and 
sustainability report of the Porsche AG Group for 
the fiscal year 2023."
"Volkswagen AG 
 
The Volkswagen Group can influence environmental, 
social and economic systems with long-term 
viability at global, regional and local level in various 
ways and actively takes responsibility to make a 
contribution to their sustainability."
"The Volkswagen 
Group has thus developed a sustainable style of 
company management and put in place the 
necessary management structures."
"The goal to sustainably shape mobility for current 
and future generations has also been anchored in 
the Volkswagen Group strategy NEW AUTO."
"The 
decarbonization of the Volkswagen Group and in 
particular its portfolio of products is a major part of 
this group strategy, where it has been defined as 
one of the focus areas in the “ESG, Decarbonization 
and Integrity” base initiative."
"As a result of a 
materiality analysis, the Volkswagen Group 
identified the following focus areas: decarbonization, 
circular economy, supply chain and human rights, 
people in transformation, diversity and integrity."
"The Volkswagen Group has established a group-
wide sustainability management."
"The related 
structures, processes and responsibilities are 
codified in a specific Volkswagen Group policy."
"Sustainability is part of the Top 10 program at the 
level of the Volkswagen Group and is managed 
through the strategic management structure of the 
Volkswagen Group NEW AUTO strategy."
"The 
content is regularly evaluated and reported to the

"Furthermore, the Volkswagen Group’s sustainability 
function coordinates all sustainability-related 
activities and the group-wide and cross-functional

Equal treatment and diversity 
 
A working environment shaped by respect and 
tolerance is the foundation of the Porsche SE 
Group’s success."
"The Porsche SE Group maintains, 
protects and promotes the equal treatment of all 
employees and a working environment with no 
place for discrimination based on personal 
background, age, gender, disability, race or ethnic 
origin, religion, sexual orientation or other personal 
characteristics."
"This primarily applies to all issues 
relating to employment, especially recruitment, 
promotion, remuneration and termination."
"Employees are selected, hired and promoted solely 
on the basis of their qualifications and skills."
"Any form of harassment (e.g., sexual harassment  
or exclusion) and the use of improper means  
(e.g., threats, coercion or physical violence) are 
strictly prohibited and not tolerated under any 
circumstances."
"Mutual respect and trust are core 
values for the Porsche SE Group."
"Any behavior 
among and towards employees that could be 
humiliating, insulting or otherwise disrespectful is 
unacceptable."
"These principles of working together apply not only 
to all employees of Porsche SE, but also when 
dealing with third parties."
"In the company’s opinion, the targets and the 
diversity concept for the composition of the 
supervisory board of Porsche SE, including the 
target for female representation, are currently met in 
full."
"The supervisory board has also resolved to 
introduce, among other things, a diversity concept 
aimed at diversifying the board of management."
"The 
board of management has also specified 
corresponding targets and deadlines for the female 
representation at the two management levels below 
the board of management."
"Please refer to the 
corresponding explanations in the declaration of 
compliance, which is published as part of the 
combined group management report in the annual 
report."
"As of 31 December 2023, the percentage of 
female employees at Porsche SE Group was 40.4% 
(31 December 2022: 43.9%)."
"Compliance with laws, other legal 
standards, the Code of Conduct, company 
guidelines and other internal company regulations is 
a basic principle of Porsche SE’s corporate 
activities and part of the corporate culture."
"Furthermore, the board of management and 
supervisory board of Porsche SE base their work on 
the principles, recommendations and suggestions 
of the German Corporate Governance Code 
(“GCGC”) for corporate management and 
supervision."
"Porsche SE follows the 
recommendations of the GCGC as regards both the 
individual entity and the group in the scope set out 
in the declaration on the GCGC and in any updates."
"Please also refer to the declaration of compliance, 
which is published as part of the combined group 
management report in the annual report."
"The 
declaration of compliance and the annual 
declaration on conformity with the 
recommendations of the GCGC are also available 
on the Porsche SE website at  
 
https://www.porsche-
se.com/en/company/corporate-governance."
"For the management of compliance risks, Porsche SE 
has established a compliance management system, a 
core component of which is the Code of Conduct at 
Porsche SE."
"This contains the central principles for 
acting in compliance with the law and rules and 
provides orientation for employees in their day-to-
day dealings with colleagues, business partners and 
third parties."
"The Code of Conduct is binding for all 
employees, including the board of management of 
Porsche SE."
"It is supplemented and specified by 
internal company guidelines on compliance."
"Furthermore, all company guidelines must be 
consistent with the Code of Conduct."
"The compliance management system of Porsche SE 
comprises the compliance organization with defined 
roles and responsibilities, measures and processes 
set up in the company and corresponding reporting 
channels."
"These aim to preemptively ensure that 
employee conduct is in line with the rules and to 
avoid compliance violations."
"The compliance 
management system is also designed to clarify, to 
put an end to and to sanction potential instances of 
misconduct."
"The compliance management system is 
supplemented by the tax compliance management 
system (“Tax CMS”) and the information security 
management system (“ISMS”), which are also part of 
Porsche SE’s risk management."
"In this connection, 
please also refer to the section “Risk management 
and internal control system of the Porsche SE Group” 
in the chapter “Opportunities and risks of future 
development” in the combined group management 
report."
"Porsche SE employees are regularly informed 
about these systems and given appropriate basic 
and advanced training."
"The board of management function responsible for 
legal affairs and compliance is responsible for 
Porsche SE’s compliance organization."
"The member 
of the board of management responsible for legal 
affairs and compliance is tasked with reporting to 
the whole board of management of Porsche SE on 
all questions relating to compliance, taking 
preventive measures, managing these and 
monitoring compliance with regulations."
"The member of the board of management 
responsible for legal affairs and compliance is also 
the company’s compliance officer."
"In addition, 
Porsche SE has set up a compliance council, which 
comprises the member of the board of management 
responsible for legal affairs and compliance and 
executives from the departments."
"The compliance 
council supports the board of management member 
responsible for legal affairs and compliance in 
performing his duties, in particular in monitoring 
compliance with the legal provisions applicable to 
the company and its employees."
"Another focus of 
the compliance council is on preventing potential 
compliance violations and reacting to these."
"The

internal company guideline on compliance specifies 
the organizational units and decision makers 
responsible for procedures relating to compliance."
"The compliance organization is also supported by 
the internal audit that is integrated in the risk 
management system."
"In addition to the further development of  
Porsche SE’s compliance management system, 
the compliance council’s meetings in the fiscal year 
2023 primarily dealt with general compliance 
matters."
"The board of management informs the supervisory 
board regularly, without delay and comprehensively, 
about all aspects that are relevant to the company, 
including compliance."
"Further information on the working methods of the 
board of management and supervisory board can 
be found in the declaration of compliance, which is 
published as part of the combined group 
management report in the annual report."
"Selected compliance aspects at Porsche SE are 
reported on below."
"Respecting human rights 
 
Adhering with and respecting human rights are non-
negotiable principles for the Porsche SE Group, 
including its respective governing bodies."
"They are 
therefore regarded as an integral part of the 
activities of the Porsche SE Group and its 
employees."
"The Porsche SE Group respects, 
protects and promotes the dignity, equality and 
freedom of every individual by committing itself to 
respecting personal rights, in particular the right to 
freedom of expression and protection of privacy."
"It 
also promotes the equal treatment of all employees 
and diversity within the company."
"Every employee is 
expected to respect the dignity and personal rights of 
every individual."
"Business partners of the Porsche SE 
Group are also expected to adhere to these values 
and commitments."
"Anti-corruption and bribery matters  
 
Corruption undermines fair competition, hinders 
innovation and progress and is therefore detrimental 
to the economy and society."
"For this reason, 
Porsche SE rejects  any form of corrupt conduct or 
behavior detrimental to the company, especially if it 
is intended to gain a competitive advantage."
"Porsche SE rejects bribery and any form of granting 
or accepting an inappropriate advantage."
"Even 
behavior that only appears to be inappropriate must 
be avoided."
"The Porsche SE Group therefore expects its 
employees to act at all times in accordance with the 
relevant anti-bribery laws."
"This applies in particular to gifts 
and invitations."
"These may be accepted and offered 
only to the extent customary in business and to a 
reasonable extent."
"In its dealings with authorities, public officials and 
politicians, the Porsche SE Group behaves in a 
transparent, legally correct and proper manner and 
avoids any appearance of unlawful influence 
(corruption and bribery)."
"This also means that no 
payments are made to accelerate routine official 
acts (facilitation payments), even if such incentives 
or payments are supposedly customary."
"In addition, the Porsche SE Group does not make 
donations or contributions to political parties."
"Anti-money laundering and countering the 
financing of terrorism 
 
Money laundering and financing of terrorism are not 
only detrimental to the economy and society, but can 
also have considerable consequences for everyone 
involved."
"This is why Porsche SE takes the risk of 
money laundering and the financing of terrorism very 
seriously and supports the international community in 
their efforts to anti-money laundering and countering 
the financing of terrorism."
"It also wants to avoid being 
used for money laundering."
"Porsche SE makes sure 
that its cash flows are transparent and accountable."
"Whenever Porsche SE works with business partners, 
it acts with the utmost care and in accordance with 
national and international regulations to anti-money 
laundering and countering the financing of terrorism."
"Porsche SE has therefore implemented measures 
designed to ensure compliant conduct."
"For example, 
the Porsche SE Group uses a KYC (Know Your 
Customer) process to verify the identity and integrity 
of the business partners, companies and other third 
parties that it interacts with so that it can ensure the 
lawful origin of their resources."
"It does so particularly 
when identifying, acquiring, managing and selling 
investments."
"The Porsche SE anti-money laundering 
officer is contacted immediately if there are any 
indications of suspicious behavior by business 
partners or other third parties."
"Porsche SE 
employees receive regular training on anti-money 
laundering and countering the financing of terrorism."
"Avoiding conflicts of interest 
 
At Porsche SE, decisions are made in the interests 
of the company and its stakeholders to the best of 
our knowledge and belief on the basis of objective 
and factual criteria."
"This is incompatible with the 
pursuit or consideration of personal or individual 
financial interests, which may inappropriately 
influence judgment and prevent decisions from 
being made in the interests of the company."
"Even 
the appearance of a personal conflict of interest can 
harm the company and must therefore be avoided."
"Under certain circumstances, a conflict of interest 
may already exist when carrying out a sideline 
activity, holding an office or investing in another 
company."
"Employees of the Porsche SE Group are 
obliged to disclose potential or actual conflicts of 
interest so that an appropriate solution can be 
developed together with the company."
"Certain 
cases require the employee to obtain approval in 
accordance with the employment contract or, in the 
case of members of the board of management, by 
the supervisory board."
"All members of the board of 
management must immediately disclose conflicts of 
interest to the supervisory board and inform the 
other members of the board of management 
accordingly."
"This applies in particular to members of 
the board of management who are also members of 
management or supervisory bodies of other 
companies, including the Volkswagen Group or the 
Porsche AG Group."

Tax honesty 
 
Taxes are essential for the good of society."
"The 
Porsche SE Group is aware of its social 
responsibility to comply with tax regulations and 
complies with national and international tax and 
duty regulations and observes these in its business 
activities."
"Violations of tax and duty regulations may 
lead to significant corporate disadvantages for 
Porsche SE."
"Consistent compliance with the legal 
regulations creates trust among the stakeholders of 
the Porsche SE Group, the tax authorities and 
society."
"The Porsche SE Group affirms and 
promotes the principle of legal tax behavior, 
regardless of whether or not the group benefits from 
this."
"Porsche SE uses internal processes and 
structures to ensure that taxes and other duties are 
calculated correctly and promptly and that they are 
duly paid."
"This is intended to prevent the 
unauthorized reduction of taxes and other duties or 
the infringement of duties to cooperate."
"The Porsche SE Group has a Tax CMS to manage 
compliance risks from tax matters."
"The Tax CMS of 
Porsche SE comprises the tax compliance 
organization with defined roles and responsibilities 
and the measures, processes and reporting channels 
set up in the company."
"Employees entrusted with the 
Tax CMS took part in external training courses on tax 
compliance in the reporting year."
"For a transparent presentation of Porsche SE’s 
taxation, please refer to the consolidated financial 
statements of Porsche SE for the fiscal year 2023."
"Information security  
 
Increasing digitalization also brings with it greater 
requirements for ensuring information security."
"Information security is the protection of information 
against a variety of threats in order to ensure 
maintenance of business operations, minimize 
business risks and thus safeguard the corporate 
strategy."
"Porsche SE has implemented an ISO/IEC 27001-
certified Information Security Management System 
(ISMS) to manage compliance risks relating to 
information security."
"This includes an information 
security organization with defined roles and 
responsibilities and the measures, processes and 
reporting channels set up in the company."
"It also 
has organizational and technical security measures 
in place, as well as a reporting system that is 
available at all times and appropriate back-up 
systems."
"The ISMS is designed to ensure the availability, 
integrity, confidentiality and authenticity of 
information."
"It aims to prevent the unauthorized 
access, misuse, manipulation or loss of sensitive 
and confidential information."
"In the reporting year, all employees completed 
training on the secure use of IT systems."
"Data protection 
 
Data protection includes protecting each 
individual’s personal data from unauthorized 
collection, processing and distribution."
"Handling 
personal data is subject to strict legal requirements, 
but can also be seen as an indicator of trust."
"Personal data is always treated 
responsibly, confidentially and with the utmost care."
"In order to meet the requirements relating to data 
protection and to manage the corresponding risks, 
Porsche SE has defined roles and responsibilities 
and set up measures and processes, which are 
specified in a company guideline."
"Porsche SE has also appointed a data protection 
officer, who works to protect the individual divisions 
from violations, regularly trains and informs 
employees about data protection and, in particular, 
gives advice to employees who deal with personal 
data in their day-to-day work."
"Porsche SE has also 
defined reporting processes and channels for 
logging data protection incidents."
"In the fiscal year 
2023, there were no reportable data protection 
violations or data breaches at Porsche SE."
"Foreign trade and investment control 
 
Porsche SE adheres to all national and international 
regulations governing the movement of goods, 
services, capital or investments."
"Porsche SE 
observes the applicable foreign trade and 
investment control laws and the resulting approval 
procedures and reporting requirements."
"The same 
applies to the international sanction lists, 
embargoes against countries and against certain 
groups, individuals, organizations and companies in 
any country."
"Porsche SE does not tolerate the 
applicable regulations being bypassed."
"Selecting and dealing with business partners 
 
Porsche SE’s business partners are selected 
impartially, without taking private or personal 
interests into account and based on offers that are 
assessed using objective and factual criteria."
"Unobjective preferential treatment or unfair 
advantage or disadvantage will not be tolerated."
"In terms of carrying amounts1, virtually 100% of 
Porsche SE’s investments have their own codes of 
conduct with defined and binding sustainability 
standards for their employees and business 
partners."
"Business partners are accordingly 
expected to pass on the requirements formulated 
therein along the supply chain."
"Compliance with the 
requirements is reportedly reviewed by the core 
investments using sustainability ratings for relevant 
companies and suppliers, which is an explicit 
condition for the award of contracts."
"The ten largest suppliers and service providers of 
the Porsche SE Group, which account for around 
two-thirds of all supplies and services purchased by 
the Porsche SE Group2, have all published their own 
codes of conduct."
"Employees of Porsche SE can use defined 
communication channels1 to report potential 
compliance violations within the company, 
anonymously if desired."
"Their first point of contact is their direct supervisor, 
and they can also contact the compliance officer at 
any time."
"Porsche SE has set up a compliance e-
mail address (compliance-pse@porsche-se.com) for 
this purpose."
"Information can also be reported 
anonymously via a mailbox."
"Porsche SE’s legal 
department and HR department, in particular for 
personnel issues, are also available as contacts."
"Porsche SE has also set up an internal reporting 
office for employees as required by the HinSchG 
[“Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz”: German 
Whistleblower Protection Act]."
"Employees can also contact the aforementioned 
people and reporting channels if they have 
questions about certain behaviors or about the 
Code of Conduct and compliance in general."
"The 
Porsche SE Group regularly makes its employees 
aware about these options."
"In addition, external third parties can report 
potential compliance violations to Porsche SE’s 
compliance e-mail address (compliance-
pse@porsche-se.com)."
"If there is reason to suspect a potential violation of 
laws, other legal standards, the Code of Conduct, 
company guidelines or other internal company 
regulations, all employees are required to report this 
immediately."
"Protecting whistleblowers is a top priority for 
Porsche SE."
"Any information or reports received are 
treated with the utmost confidentiality."
"Regardless 
of whether the suspicion is confirmed or not, the 
person who made the report will not suffer any 
disadvantages simply for making the report, 
provided there were reasonable grounds for the 
report."
"However, in the case of a voluntary self-
report, this does not protect the individual from the 
consequences of the reported misconduct itself."
"Porsche SE resolutely investigates all reports of 
potential compliance violations brought to its 
attention."
"If it detects a violation or misconduct, it 
immediately initiates corrective action and imposes 
appropriate consequences."
"Misconduct or 
violations of the principles set out in the Code of 
Conduct will not be tolerated."
"No reports of potential compliance violations were 
received via Porsche SE’s whistleblower system in 
either the reporting year or the prior year."
"Climate change mitigation 
The following explanations about CO2 emissions are 
based on the principles of the internationally 
accepted Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol2 and are 
broken down accordingly into Scope 1 to Scope 3 
emissions."
"Under these principles, CO2 emissions 
from investment companies, i.e., mainly from 
Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG, are allocated to

Porsche SE is based exclusively in Germany.
"The pure holding 
operations of the Porsche SE Group causes 
comparatively low CO2 emissions, which is why 
exact emission measurements have not been 
carried out to date."
"Regardless of this, Porsche SE as a company has a 
special responsibility towards the environment and 
complies with all relevant statutory provisions and 
binding standards on environmental and climate 
protection."
"Porsche SE is committed to the Paris 
Climate Agreement and therefore welcomes the 
European Union’s climate targets of reducing CO2 
emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 
1990 levels, and achieving climate neutrality2 by 
2050."
"Porsche SE promotes resource-conserving 
business practices and strives to continuously 
optimize the use of resources."
"Every employee of 
Porsche SE is expected to use natural resources 
appropriately and sparingly in the course of their 
work and ensure that their activities have the 
smallest-possible impact on the environment."
"The direct CO2 emissions of the Porsche SE Group 
(Scope 1) relate exclusively to emissions resulting 
from business trips with Porsche SE company cars 
and lease vehicles."
"As of 31 December 2023, 
Porsche SE had 29 vehicles whose emissions are 
allocated to this category."
"To promote all-electric 
vehicles, Porsche SE offers special subsidies to 
such company cars and lease vehicles."
"Indirect emissions of the Porsche SE Group from 
purchased energy (Scope 2) are caused by the 
energy supply for the rented office space and for 
charging Porsche SE’s all-electric vehicles related to 
business trips."

the latter generate some of their energy in an 
environmentally friendly fashion."
"Residual Scope 2 
emissions of Porsche SE are offset by Porsche AG 
as the lessor via carbon offset projects that are 
expected to meet strict, internationally recognized 
standards."
"The rented office space is also 
integrated into the lessor’s certified management 
systems for the entire site, which monitor the 
impact on the environment, including as much 
relevant air and water pollution, energy 
consumption and waste."
"In the reporting year, the 
recertifications required under ISO 14001 and ISO 
50001 site were successfully carried out and 
revalidated under EMAS."
"The CO2 emissions of the Porsche SE Group in its 
upstream and downstream value chain (Scope 3) 
are categorized into 15 categories in accordance 
with the GHG Protocol, which are shown in the 
following table."

Porsche SE virtually, sustainability aspects were one 
of various aspects that the board of management 
considered at its discretion."
"The CO2 impact of a 
virtual annual general meeting is significantly lower 
than that of an in-person event."
"These are based on 
extracts from the Annual Report as well as the 
Sustainability Report of the Volkswagen Group for 
the fiscal year 2023 and the Annual and 
Sustainability Report of the Porsche AG Group for 
the fiscal year 2023."

As one of the world’s largest automotive 
manufacturers, Volkswagen is aware of the 
responsibility this entails and is committed to the 
Paris Climate Agreement."
"The Volkswagen Group’s 
comprehensive decarbonization program includes 
the whole life cycle of the vehicles and is 
characterized by a clear hierarchy of measures: The 
top priority is measures with which CO2 emissions 
can be avoided."
"In second place follow measures 
with which the Volkswagen Group can gradually 
shift the energy supply in all steps of the value chain 
to renewable energy."
"Finally, unavoidable CO2 
emissions are offset in selected cases through 
climate protection projects that meet the highest 
international standards."
"The Volkswagen Group 
wants to become a net carbon-neutral company by 
2050."
"To achieve this goal, offset action is also 
planned alongside carbon reduction measures and 
converting to renewable energies."
"The Volkswagen Group has set itself the objective 
of reducing CO2 emissions from the production of 
its passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 
50.4% by 2030 – compared with the base year of 
2018."
"By 2030, the Volkswagen Group wants to 
emit 30% less CO2 on average per vehicle 
(passenger cars and light commercial vehicles) over 
the entire life cycle than in 2018."
"The targets are to 
be achieved through pure CO2 reduction."

to the Volkswagen Group in the reporting year that 
the company is fulfilling the conditions for limiting 
global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius with its 
objective for the production phase (Scope 1 and 2)."
"1 To avoid double counting, either the Scope 1, Scope 2 and upstream Scope 3 emissions (categories 1 to 8) or the downstream Scope 3 
emissions (category 15) would have to be adjusted."
"When 
deciding to hold the annual general meeting of 
Porsche SE virtually, sustainability aspects were one 
of various aspects that the board of management 
considered at its discretion."
"The CO2 impact of a 
virtual annual general meeting is significantly lower 
than that of an in-person event."
"These are based on 
extracts from the Annual Report as well as the 
Sustainability Report of the Volkswagen Group for 
the fiscal year 2023 and the Annual and 
Sustainability Report of the Porsche AG Group for 
the fiscal year 2023."
"Volkswagen Group 
As one of the world’s largest automotive 
manufacturers, Volkswagen is aware of the 
responsibility this entails and is committed to the 
Paris Climate Agreement."
"The Volkswagen Group’s 
comprehensive decarbonization program includes 
the whole life cycle of the vehicles and is 
characterized by a clear hierarchy of measures: The 
top priority is measures with which CO2 emissions 
can be avoided."
"In second place follow measures 
with which the Volkswagen Group can gradually 
shift the energy supply in all steps of the value chain 
to renewable energy."
"Finally, unavoidable CO2 
emissions are offset in selected cases through 
climate protection projects that meet the highest 
international standards."
"The Volkswagen Group 
wants to become a net carbon-neutral company by 
2050."
"To achieve this goal, offset action is also 
planned alongside carbon reduction measures and 
converting to renewable energies."
"The Volkswagen Group has set itself the objective 
of reducing CO2 emissions from the production of 
its passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 
50.4% by 2030 – compared with the base year of 
2018."
"By 2030, the Volkswagen Group wants to 
emit 30% less CO2 on average per vehicle 
(passenger cars and light commercial vehicles) over 
the entire life cycle than in 2018."
"The targets are to 
be achieved through pure CO2 reduction."
"The 
Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) confirmed 
to the Volkswagen Group in the reporting year that 
the company is fulfilling the conditions for limiting 
global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius with its 
objective for the production phase (Scope 1 and 2)."
"1 To avoid double counting, either the Scope 1, Scope 2 and upstream Scope 3 emissions (categories 1 to 8) or the downstream Scope 3 
emissions (category 15) would have to be adjusted."
"Decarbonization targets were also formulated in  
the area of heavy trucks and buses, and these 
represent sub-targets for the Group."
"For example, 
Scania is committed to reducing its absolute Scope 
1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% 
by 2025 compared with the base year of 2015."
"The 
Scope 3 emissions from the use of vehicles sold are 
to be reduced by 20% per vehicle kilometer by 
2025 at Scania, also compared with a 2015 baseline."
"The SBTi confirmed to Scania that these targets are 
at a level that allow global warming to be limited to 
1.5 degrees Celsius."
"MAN also received SBTi 
certification of its decarbonization target."
"Compared 
with 2019, by 2030 the Group wants to reduce its 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% and its 
Scope 3 emissions by 28%."
"In addition, Scania and 
MAN have committed to the SBTi’s Net-Zero 
Standard."
"Volkswagen Truck & Bus and Navistar 
have also set reduction targets and are working on 
having these validated by the SBTi."
"Porsche AG Group 
 
The Porsche AG Group is aware of its responsibility 
for climate change mitigation and is committed to 
the targets agreed in the Paris Agreement in 2015."
"For this reason, the Porsche AG Group structures 
its processes and products to build a net carbon 
neutral future in which resources are used as 
responsibly as possible."
"The focus here is on 
vehicle decarbonization, the development of 
alternative drive systems, reducing consumption of 
primary resources and making increasing use of 
more ecological materials1 in vehicles and in their 
upstream supply chains."
"The Porsche AG Group intends to lower its 
average CO2 emissions along the value chain  
and over the vehicles’ entire life cycles2."
"The Porsche AG Group has developed its reduction 
pathway based on existing 1.5-degree climate 
scenarios and formulated specific targets at vehicle 
level and requirements at the component level."
"The 
Porsche AG Group intends to have its targets 
validated by the SBTi within two years, which is 
currently revising its scenarios."
"In October 2023, the 
SBTi published a draft version of the sectoral 
roadmap for the automotive industry, which is 
currently under consultation."
"The Porsche AG 
Group expects that the final reduction targets will 
be in line with the 1.5 degree target."
"1 For the Porsche AG Group, more ecological materials are reduced-carbon primary materials or circular materials."
"Reduced-carbon primary 
materials are characterized by the fact that they cause less CO2 per kilogram of primary material than the average materials of the same type 
used in the EU."
"The Porsche AG Group uses the term circular to describe materials that are partly produced from pre- and post-consumer 
scrap or from renewable raw materials."
"2 Life cycle includes the CO2 emissions of a vehicle in the supply chain, the Porsche AG Group’s production, use phase of 200,000 km and 
recycling."
"91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The SBTi has confirmed the aim of reducing CO2 
emissions by 30% in the use phase (Scope 3) to the 
Volkswagen Group as in line with the limitation of 
global warming to two degrees Celsius."
"Decarbonization targets were also formulated in  
the area of heavy trucks and buses, and these 
represent sub-targets for the Group."

"Electromobility is 
at the heart of Porsche AG’s product strategy."
"The 
Porsche AG Group aims to deliver more than 80% 
of its new vehicles with all-electric drive systems by 
2030 – depending on demand and the development 
of electromobility in the individual regions of the

emissions along the value chain of the newly produced vehicles should be offset."
"Emissions of vehicles produced prior to achieving net 
carbon neutrality along the value chain of the vehicles are not taken into account for the calculation of the carbon balance."

The Porsche SE Group 
Porsche Automobil Holding SE (“Porsche SE” or the

in the areas of mobility and industrial technology."

Stuttgart, and Porsche Vierte Beteiligung GmbH, 
Stuttgart."
"The management report for Porsche SE and the 
group management report for the Porsche SE 
Group are combined in this report (“combined 
group management report”)."
"This 
requires investing in companies that contribute to 
the mid- and long-term profitability of the Porsche 
SE Group while securing sufficient liquidity."
"In order to strengthen the basis for creating 
sustainable value with a balanced risk/return profile, 
investment activities are to be expanded in the long 
term and the existing investment platform scaled 
further."
"By further diversifying the investment 
portfolio Porsche SE aims to increase its resilience."
"In the long term, this does not rule out the 
evaluation of a possible reallocation both between 
the core investments and the portfolio investments 
and within the two categories."
"Measures to strengthen Porsche SE’s resilience also 
include the mitigation of potential risks in 
connection with the negative effects of business 
activities on the environment and society."
"Porsche 
SE therefore pursues the goal of sustainable 
corporate governance and the implementation of 
environmental, social and governance (“ESG” or 
sustainability) aspects both for its holding 
operations and with regard to its investment 
decisions."
"An additional strategic goal of Porsche SE is to 
position itself as a partner of choice for investment 
partners."
"Porsche SE has access to an extensive 
network of experts in the mobility and industrial 
sectors."
"The benefit for Porsche SE lies in the 
identification and assessment of investment 
opportunities and in the development of the 
individual investments."
"It also makes Porsche SE 
attractive for investment partners."
"A key success factor for Porsche SE in 
implementing its corporate strategy are its 
employees."
"Porsche SE has therefore set itself the 
strategic goal of further establishing itself as a top 
employer."
"Investment strategy  
Porsche SE currently intends to make annual 
investments in the low three-digit million-euro range 
to expand its portfolio investments."
"The sector 
focus on mobility and industrial technology is to be 
supplemented by investments in related areas."
"Acquisitions of core investments are also continually 
evaluated for opportunities."
"A central component of the investment strategy is 
the cooperation with strong investment partners 
and co-investors for direct investments."
"In addition, 
the investment portfolio is to be expanded by 
investing further in private equity and venture 
capital funds."
"With the investment in Porsche AG and the other 
investments in portfolio companies, an important 
step has been taken towards diversifying the 
investment portfolio."
"Porsche SE has also already 
gained strong investment partners in Bridgepoint 
Advisers Limited London, UK (“Bridgepoint”), Digital 
Transformation Capital Partners GmbH, Hamburg 
(“DTCP”), and EQT Partners AB, Stockholm, 
Sweden (“EQT”)."
"The focus here is on 
securing sufficient liquidity, broad access to the 
capital market at attractive conditions and limiting 
financial risks."
"In order to ensure this, Porsche SE is 
currently aiming to further reduce its debt – subject 
to possible acquisitions – annually by a mid-triple-
digit million-euro amount and continue to be geared 
towards an investment grade profile."
"Since raising debt capital in the amount of  
€7.1 billion in September 2022 to finance the 
acquisition of ordinary shares of Porsche AG, 
financial liabilities have already been significantly 
reduced to €6.7 billion."
"As of 31 December 2023, 
group net debt had been reduced even more 
significantly from €6.7 billion to €5.7 billion."
"The 
loan-to-value ratio, i.e., the ratio of net debt to the 
market value of the core and portfolio investments, 
stands at 19.7% as of 31 December 2023."
"In the 
long term, Porsche SE aims to achieve a loan-to-
value ratio in the low double-digit percentage range."
"Dividend policy 
Porsche SE’s dividend policy is generally geared to 
stability."
"Sustainability strategy  
Sustainability aspects are an important part of 
corporate governance and strategy at the Porsche 
SE Group."
"The Porsche SE Group’s responsibility to 
act sustainably is set out in its Code of Conduct."
"As a pure holding company without control over any 
of its operating investments as defined by IFRS, 
Porsche SE distinguishes in its sustainability 
strategy between its holding operations (“holding 
level”) and its core and portfolio investments 
(“investment level”)."
"The holding level comprises Porsche SE and the 
companies fully consolidated in the consolidated 
financial statements of Porsche SE, all of which are 
intermediate holding companies."
"Porsche SE 
pursues and implements its own sustainability 
strategy at holding level."
"In addition to 
promoting health and advanced training, the 
primary aim is to attract and retain qualified 
employees."
"Accordingly, Porsche SE intends to 
further establish itself as a top employer."
"Compliance is also considered to be particularly 
relevant at holding level."
"Porsche SE is fully committed to compliance as part 
of its corporate culture."
"Compliance with laws, other 
legal standards, the Code of Conduct, company 
guidelines and other internal company regulations is 
a basic principle of Porsche SE’s corporate 
activities."
"At investment level, on the other hand, the 
individual investment companies develop and 
implement their own sustainability strategies."
"Porsche SE’s strategy is therefore limited to taking 
sustainability aspects into account in its investment 
decisions and subsequently exercising its role as a 
responsible investor accordingly."
"Prior to acquiring investments, due diligence 
reviews are regularly carried out with the support of 
external consultants (including specialized 
sustainability consultants), which may also include 
ESG aspects."
"Consideration of sustainability 
aspects is an integral part of the investment process 
and is enshrined in an internal policy."
"Porsche SE 
invests in sustainable business models and thus 
provides growth capital for its portfolio investments, 
which can contribute to the transition to a 
sustainable economy."
"Besides the two core 
investments, the Porsche SE Group has over the 
past few years invested in several companies that 
have significant sustainability aspects built into their 
business model."
"Due to a lack of control as defined by IFRS, 
Porsche SE can only encourage sustainable 
corporate governance of its investments through 
the shareholder dialog and board work."
"Porsche SE 
assumes the role of a responsible investor in order 
to strengthen the resilience of its investment 
portfolio in cooperation with its partners, also with 
regard to potential sustainability risks."
"Porsche SE supports the sustainability strategies of 
its core investments."
"Porsche SE is 
convinced that the Volkswagen Group will play a 
leading role in the transformation of the automotive 
industry and for this reason also has considerable 
potential for increasing value."
"In line with this 
corporate goal, the IFRS group result after tax and 
group net debt/net liquidity are the core 
management indicators in the Porsche SE Group."
"By definition, net debt of the Porsche SE Group is 
calculated as financial liabilities less cash and cash 
equivalents, time deposits and securities each 
derived from the consolidated balance sheet."
"Net 
debt of the Porsche SE Group corresponds to 
negative net liquidity."
"The terminology of net 
liquidity was adjusted accordingly following the 
raising of debt capital in the prior year."
"There were no changes to the management system 
in the fiscal year 2023."
"In line with its investment strategy, the Porsche SE 
Group differentiates for management purposes 
between the two segments “core investments” and 
“portfolio investments”."
"Porsche SE’s holding 
operations, comprising Porsche SE’s corporate 
functions, including the holding financing function, 
are all allocated to the “core investments” for the 
purpose of managing resources."
"Transactions 
between the segments, i.e., in particular intragroup 
financing transactions, are not managed separately 
and are therefore eliminated so that consolidated 
figures are always used for management purposes."
"For this reason, net debt is only relevant as a 
management indicator at the level of the “core 
investments” segment or the group as a whole."
"Because the company is managed on the basis of 
consolidated figures, there is no separate 
management and forecast of the core performance 
indicators for Porsche SE as an individual entity."
"The planning and budgeting process implemented 
in the Porsche SE Group is designed to enable 
management to take its decisions on the basis of 
the development of these indicators."
"In this context, 
an integrated multi-year plan is prepared for the 
results of operations, financial position and net 
assets of the Porsche SE Group."
"In the course of the year, the development of the 
indicators is continuously tracked and made 
available to the board of management and 
supervisory board in regular reports."
"With regard to compliance with the prior-year 
forecast, see also the “Overall statement on the 
economic situation of the Porsche SE Group” in the 
“Report on economic position”."
"With regard to the 
forecast for the fiscal year 2024, see “Anticipated 
development of the Porsche SE Group” in “Forecast 
report and outlook”."
"Porsche SE sees itself as a long-term anchor investor of  
Volkswagen AG."
"The Volkswagen Group comprises ten brands from five 
European countries: Volkswagen, Volkswagen Commercial 
Vehicles, ŠKODA, SEAT, CUPRA, Audi, Lamborghini,  
Bentley, Porsche and Ducati."
"In addition, the Volkswagen 
Group offers a wide range of other brands and business areas, 
including financial services, involving dealer and customer 
financing, leasing, banking and insurance activities as well  
as fleet management."
"Porsche AG
Porsche SE directly holds 25.0 
% plus one share of the  
ordinary shares and thus around 12.5 
% of the subscribed 
capital of Porsche AG."
"Volkswagen AG indirectly holds, via 
Porsche Holding Stuttgart GmbH, 75.0 
% of the ordinary 
shares less one ordinary share and 75.4 
% of the subscribed 
capital of Porsche AG."
"Porsche AG is one of the world’s most successful luxury  
automotive manufacturers."
"The “Porsche” brand is  
synonymous with design and engineering heritage, perfor-
mance, modern and sustainable luxury, prestige, innovation, 
technological achievement and reliability."
"Volkswagen AG’s subscribed 
capital of €1,283 million is made up of 59% ordinary 
shares and 41% non-voting preference shares."
"The 
ordinary and preference shares issued by 
Volkswagen AG have been admitted to trading on 
the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange (Prime Standard)."
"The preference shares 
of Volkswagen AG are also included in the German 
Share Index (“DAX”)."
"Volkswagen AG develops 
vehicles and components for the group brands, but 
also produces and sells vehicles, in particular 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles for 
the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles brands."
"In its capacity as 
parent company, Volkswagen AG holds direct or 
indirect interests in AUDI AG, SEAT S.A., ŠKODA 
AUTO a.s., Porsche AG, TRATON SE (“TRATON”), 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG, Volkswagen 
Bank GmbH and a large number of other companies 
in Germany and abroad."
"The Volkswagen Group is one of the leading 
multibrand groups in the automotive industry."
"The 
company’s business activities comprise the 
automotive and financial services divisions."
"Volkswagen’s automotive division comprises the 
passenger cars, commercial vehicles and power 
engineering business areas."
"The product portfolio ranges from 
compact cars to luxury vehicles and also includes 
motorcycles, and is supplemented by mobility 
solutions."
"The commercial vehicles business area primarily 
comprises the development, production and sale of 
trucks and buses, the corresponding genuine parts 
business and related services."
"The commercial 
vehicles portfolio ranges from light vans to heavy 
trucks and buses."
"The collaboration between the 
commercial vehicle brands is coordinated within 
TRATON SE."
"The power engineering business area combines the 
large-bore diesel engines, turbomachinery and 
propulsion components businesses."
"The activities of Volkswagen’s financial services 
division comprise dealer and customer financing, 
leasing, direct banking and insurance activities, fleet 
management and mobility services."
"With its brands, the Volkswagen Group is present in 
all of the markets around the world that are relevant 
for the group."
"The key sales markets currently 
include Western Europe, China, the USA, Brazil, 
Türkiye, Mexico, Poland and the Czech Republic."
"Volkswagen expects the market for electric vehicles 
to continue to grow in the next few years, meaning 
that the cost-efficient and sustainable production of 
battery systems and the expansion of the charging 
infrastructure are deemed to be crucial to success."
"Volkswagen expects the shift to connected, 
intelligent and eventually self-driving vehicles, 
however, to bring more wide-reaching changes for 
the automotive industry."

equity

"The group result after tax and non-controlling 
interests of the Volkswagen Group increased to 
€16.0 billion in the fiscal year 2023 compared to 
€14.9 billion in the prior-year period."
"For details on 
the development in the result at the Volkswagen 
Group, please refer to the sections “Business 
development” and “Results of operations of the 
Volkswagen Group”."
"However, an impairment of the investment 
cannot be ruled out, particularly in the event of any 
sustained decline in earnings."
"This may also have 
consequences for the dividend policy of 
Volkswagen AG and therefore for the cash inflows at 
the level of Porsche SE."
"For explanations of the 
risks in connection with the investment in 
Volkswagen AG, please refer to the explanations in 
the section “Opportunities and risks of future 
development”."
"On 10 May 2023, the annual general meeting of 
Volkswagen AG resolved to distribute a dividend for 
the fiscal year 2022 of €8.70 per ordinary share and 
€8.76 per preference share."
"The shares of 
Volkswagen AG held by Porsche SE thus entitled 
the latter to a dividend of €1.4 billion, which was 
collected in the second quarter of 2023."
"Significant developments with regard to the 
investment in Porsche AG accounted for at 
equity 
 
Due to its share in capital of Porsche AG, Porsche 
SE is also influenced by the developments at the 
level of the Porsche AG Group."
"The group result 
after tax and non-controlling interests of the 
Porsche AG Group increased to €5.2 billion in the 
fiscal year 2023 compared to €5.0 billion in the 
prior-year period."
"As of 31 December 2023, likewise for the 
investment in Porsche AG, no indication of an 
impairment of the carrying amount accounted for at 
equity was determined."
"However, an impairment of 
the investment cannot be ruled out, particularly in 
the event of any sustained decline in earnings."
"This 
may also have consequences for the dividend 
policy of Porsche AG and therefore for the cash 
inflows at the level of Porsche SE."
"For explanations 
of the risks in connection with the investment in 
Porsche AG, please refer to the explanations in the 
section “Opportunities and risks of future 
development”."
"The dividend for the fiscal year 2022 of €1.00 per 
ordinary share and €1.01 per preference share 
resolved by the annual general meeting of Porsche 
AG on 28 June 2023 was received by Porsche SE 
on 3 July 2023, amounting to €114 million in 
proportion to the number of ordinary shares held."
"Dividend proposal 
 
Porsche SE’s dividend policy is generally geared to 
stability."
"Porsche SE’s board of management 
therefore proposes a resolution for the distribution 
of a dividend of €2.554 (€2.554) per ordinary share 
and €2.560 (€2.560) per preference share, i.e., a 
total distribution of €783 million (€783 million)."
"Significant developments and current status 
relating to litigation risks and legal disputes  
 
Porsche SE is involved in various legal proceedings."
"The main developments are described in the 
following."
"Porsche SE continues not to have reliable 
findings or assessments that would lead to a 
different evaluation of the legal risks."
"Subject of 
those actions were alleged damage claims based 
on alleged market manipulation and alleged 
inaccurate information in connection with Porsche 
SE’s increase of the investment in Volkswagen AG."
"In part these claims were also based on alleged 
violations of antitrust regulations."
"In the six initial 
proceedings suspended with reference to the model 
case, a total of 40 plaintiffs are asserting alleged 
claims for damages of about €5.4 billion (plus 
interest)."
"By decision of 30 September 2022, all of 
the establishment objectives requested by the 
plaintiffs were dismissed or declared groundless by 
the Higher Regional Court of Celle."
"The Higher Regional Court of Celle substantiates its 
decision on the opinion that Porsche SE cannot be 
deemed liable under any legal aspect and that the 
opposed pleading of the plaintiffs is inconclusive."
"With this decision, Porsche SE considers its legal 
position justified that the claims asserted in the 
suspended initial proceedings are without merit."
"The 
decision of the Higher Regional Court of Celle is not 
yet final."
"The plaintiffs filed an appeal against the 
decision with the Federal Court of Justice."
"In a proceeding pending before the Regional Court 
of Frankfurt against an incumbent and a former, 
meanwhile deceased, member of the supervisory 
board of Porsche SE, Porsche SE joined as 
intervener in support of the defendants."
"No new 
developments occurred in this proceeding during 
the reporting period."
"Porsche SE considers these 
claims to be without merit and sees itself justified in 
this legal position by the decision of the Higher 
Regional Court of Celle of 30 September 2022."
"Since 2012, Porsche SE and two companies of an 
investment fund have been in dispute over the 
existence of alleged claims in the amount of about 
US$195 million and have filed lawsuits in Germany 
and England respectively."
"On 6 March 2013, the 
English proceedings were suspended at the request 
of both parties until a final decision had been 
reached in the proceedings commenced in the 
Regional Court of Stuttgart concerning the question 
of which court is the court first seized."
"A final 
decision on this issue continues to be outstanding."
"Currently, the proceedings are pending before the 
Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"On 
21 December 2021, the Higher Regional Court of 
Stuttgart decided that witnesses are to be 
interrogated in the United Kingdom by way of a 
request for mutual legal assistance."
"On 11 May 
2023 one of the witnesses was interrogated by the  
113

Oxford County Court."
"The other witness referred to 
his right to refuse to testify pursuant to German law 
via the High Court."
"The Higher Regional Court of 
Stuttgart will decide whether or not the right to 
refuse to testify applies."
"Only thereafter, and only if 
the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart has decided 
that a right to refuse to testify does not apply, can 
the other witness be interrogated by the English 
courts."
"Porsche SE considers the action filed in 
England to be inadmissible and the asserted claims 
to be without merit."
"The plaintiffs 
accuse Porsche SE of alleged nonfeasance of 
capital market information or alleged incorrect 
capital market information in connection with the 
diesel issue."
"Some of these proceedings are 
directed against both Porsche SE and Volkswagen 
AG."
"Porsche SE considers the actions to be 
inadmissible in part, but in any case to be without 
merit."
"Before the Regional Court of Stuttgart 209 actions 
are currently pending at first instance."
"The actions 
pending at first instance concern payment of 
damages, if quantified, in the total amount of 
approximately €797 million (plus interest) and in part 
establishment of liability for damages."
"Proceedings 
at first instance, with a total amount of 
approximately €80.9 million (plus interest), are 
currently suspended, whereby the majority of the 
suspended proceedings are suspended with 
reference to a KapMuG proceeding meanwhile 
pending before the Federal Court of Justice."
"Porsche SE considers the actions filed against it 
before the Regional Court of Stuttgart to be without 
merit."
"The actions filed against Porsche SE before 
the Regional Court of Braunschweig are considered 
by Porsche SE to be inadmissible and without merit."
"In addition, two further proceedings, in which a total 
of a further approximately €129 million (plus interest) 
in damages was claimed, are pending before the 
Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart on appeal."
"In one 
of the appeal proceedings in which approximately 
€5.7 million (plus interest) in damages was claimed, 
the Regional Court of Stuttgart had granted the 
action in the amount of approximately €3.2 million 
(plus interest) and otherwise dismissed the action 
on 24 October 2018."
"Porsche SE and the plaintiff 
filed appeals."
"The proceeding has been suspended 
in the meanwhile with reference to a KapMuG 
proceeding pending before the Federal Court of 
Justice."
"In the further proceeding, which is partly on 
appeal, plaintiffs object to the fact that the Regional 
Court of Stuttgart dismissed their actions as 
inadmissible on 26 August 2021."
"The amount in 
dispute is approximately €123 million (plus interest)."
"Porsche SE considers these actions pending 
against it before the Higher Regional Court of 
Stuttgart to be without merit."
"A KapMuG proceeding, initiated by order for 
reference of the Regional Court of Stuttgart of 
28 February 2017, was pending before the Higher 
Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"On 22 October 2020, 
the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart appointed a 
model case plaintiff."
"Several hearings have taken 
place before the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"The Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart expanded 
the model case with further establishment 
objectives."
"During the hearing of 7 December 2022, 
the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart interrogated 
two former members of the board of management 
of Porsche SE as witnesses."
"In its model case ruling of 29 March 2023, 
the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart found that, in 
principle, an ad hoc disclosure obligation of 
Porsche SE can also exist with respect to 
circumstances at Volkswagen AG."
"If 
there is a specific reason for doing so, the board of 
management has a duty to make specific inquiries."
"With regard to any knowledge of the board of 
management of Porsche SE or breach of duty, the 
plaintiffs have the burden of proof."
"The Higher 
Regional Court of Stuttgart also ruled that any 
knowledge of confidential circumstances at 
Volkswagen AG of board members of Volkswagen 
AG who are also members of the board of 
management of Porsche SE cannot be attributed to 
Porsche SE."
"In addition, the Higher Regional Court 
of Stuttgart ruled that any knowledge of 
circumstances at Volkswagen AG on the level below 
the board of management of Volkswagen AG cannot 
be attributed to Porsche SE."
"Finally, the Higher 
Regional Court of Stuttgart ruled that the members 
of the board of management of Porsche SE at the 
time, Dr. Wendelin Wiedeking and Holger P
."
"Härter, 
had no knowledge of the diesel issue and such 
missing knowledge was also not based on gross 
negligence on their side."
"The establishment 
objectives sought by the plaintiffs against Porsche 
SE were therefore overwhelmingly not made by the 
Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"On the basis of 
the establishment objectives made in the model 
case ruling and the current status of the matter in 
dispute in the initial proceedings, all investor claims 
against Porsche SE in the suspended initial 
proceedings would, as a result, have to be 
dismissed."
The model case ruling is not yet final.
"The model case plaintiff, several plaintiffs and 
Porsche SE have filed an appeal on points of law 
against the model case ruling."
"Following corresponding orders to suspend the 
proceedings by the Regional Court of Braunschweig 
and the courts of Stuttgart, Porsche SE became a 
further model case defendant in the model case 
proceedings before the Higher Regional Court of 
Braunschweig."
"The Higher Regional Court of 
Braunschweig issued a binding partial model case 
ruling regarding questions of jurisdiction."
"Several 
hearings have taken place before the Higher 
Regional Court of Braunschweig."
"On 7 July 2023 
the Higher Regional Court of Braunschweig issued 
an order to take evidence and requested numerous 
persons to be interrogated and documents to be 
produced and submitted."
"Furthermore, evidence will be gathered on 
expectations of the persons responsible for ad-hoc 
publications within Volkswagen AG regarding 
possible effects on the share price resulting from 
the information available to each of them."
"The 
interrogations commenced in the autumn of 2023 
and will be resumed."
"The

plaintiffs claim to be shareholders of Volkswagen 
AG and allege claims of Volkswagen AG on its 
behalf."
"The action is based, inter alia, on an alleged 
violation of duties vis-à-vis Volkswagen AG 
pursuant to the AktG [“Aktiengesetz”: German 
Stock Corporation Act] and the German Corporate 
Governance Code (Deutscher Corporate 
Governance Kodex – DCGK)."
"The plaintiffs request, 
inter alia, a declaration that the defendants have 
breached their respective duties vis-à-vis 
Volkswagen AG, and an award to Volkswagen AG 
as compensation for the alleged damages it 
sustained as a result of the alleged violation of 
duties, plus interest."
"In September 2021, the parties 
filed a stipulation, which is subject to court approval, 
accepting service on behalf of certain defendants 
including Porsche SE, staying all discovery and 
setting a motion to dismiss briefing schedule."
"Status proceedings regarding the composition 
of Porsche SE’s supervisory board 
 
So-called status proceedings were initiated against 
Porsche SE before the Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"With applications dated 11 July 2021 and 18 July 
2021, the applicant has asked the court to find that 
Porsche SE’s supervisory board is to be composed 
of half shareholder representatives and half 
employee representatives."
"In a ruling dated 
24 January 2023, the Regional Court of Stuttgart 
dismissed these applications as inadmissible and 
without merit and determined that Porsche SE’s 
supervisory board is composed in accordance with 
the law."
"The applicant initially filed an appeal 
against this ruling, but later withdrew his appeal."
"The decision of the Regional Court is therefore final 
and the proceedings have ended."
"A new vehicle 
brand is to be created under the name of Scout to 
distribute electrified all-terrain vehicles and pickups 
in the USA from 2026."
"In order to finance the 
creation of the Scout brand, as well as vehicle 
development and production planning, an amount 
of US$493 million was contributed to the company 
in the fiscal year 2023."
"The company has been 
included in the Volkswagen consolidated financial 
statements since 1 January 2023."
"The process of winding down Argo AI, LLC, 
Pittsburgh, USA (“Argo AI”), was initiated in the third 
quarter of 2022."
"In this context, Volkswagen 
contributed US$60 million to the company in the 
first half of 2023."
"The contribution was written down 
in full."
"In the prior year, an expense of €1.9 billion 
had been recognized from the full impairment of the 
equity investment in Argo AI at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group."
"In the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the Volkswagen 
Group acquired new shares in QuantumScape 
Corporation, San José, USA (“QuantumScape”), 
through forward purchase agreements resulting 
from a capital increase."
"Due to QuantumScape’s 
simultaneous listing on the New York Stock 
Exchange, the forward purchase agreements had to 
 
 
 
 
be measured at the respective closing prices."
"As a 
consequence, a non-cash gain of €1.4 billion was 
recognized at the level of the Volkswagen Group in 
the fiscal year 2020 and a non-cash expense of 
€0.6 billion in the fiscal year 2021."
"In total, there 
was a non-cash increase of €0.8 billion."
"Due to the 
share price performance, the Volkswagen Group 
conducted an impairment test on the shares in 
QuantumScape."
"The carrying amount was adjusted 
on the basis of the impairment test."
"This adjustment 
led to a non-cash expense of €0.3 billion at the level 
of the Volkswagen Group in the second quarter of 
2023."
"An additional adjustment of €0.1 billion was 
identified in the third quarter of 2023."
"Overall, there 
was a non-cash expense of €0.4 billion at the level 
of the Volkswagen Group in the fiscal year 2023."
"With equity interests 
unchanged, the amendments led to a loss of control 
over the company by the Volkswagen Group and 
resulted in its deconsolidation."
"The company has 
since 1 October 2023 been jointly controlled within 
the meaning of IFRS 11."
"The investment in Audi 
FAW NEV Co."
"will consequently be included in 
Volkswagen’s consolidated financial statements as 
a joint venture using the equity method."
"As a result 
of the change to the way the investment is 
accounted for, the cash and cash equivalents

previously reported declined by a low three-digit 
million-euro amount."
"Other than that, there were no 
material effects on the Volkswagen Group’s net 
assets, financial position and results of operations."
"On 6 December 2023, Volkswagen acquired  
4.99% of the ordinary shares of the electric vehicle 
company XPeng Inc., Cayman Islands (“XPeng”), at 
a purchase price totaling US$706 million."
"The 
realization of a forward transaction dating from 
26 July 2023 resulted in a non-cash gain of  
€74.2 million at the level of the Volkswagen Group  
in the fiscal year 2023."
"Along with the agreement to 
acquire the shares, a technological framework 
agreement was signed with Guangdong Xiaopeng 
Motors Technology Co."
"Ltd., Guangzhou, China, a 
subsidiary of XPeng, for the joint development of 
electric vehicles in China, among other things."
"The 
investment in XPeng is measured at fair value with 
recognition of fair value changes through other 
comprehensive income."
"Both investments are 
classified as debt instruments in the financial 
statements and measured at fair value through 
profit or loss."
"The measurement did not result in any 
significant effects at the level of the Volkswagen 
Group in the fiscal year 2023."
"To promote the development of highly automated 
and autonomous driving in China, Volkswagen has 
also agreed the establishment of a joint venture with 
Horizon Robotics."
"On 14 December 2023, 
Volkswagen invested an amount of CNY 2 billion to 
this end in exchange for an ownership interest of 60% 
in the new company, CARIZON (Beijing) Technology 
Company Limited, Beijing, China."
"In addition, 
Volkswagen has committed to contribute capital in 
the future of up to CNY 8.4 billion to the joint 
venture."
"Russia-Ukraine war  
 
The start of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 
2022 led not only to a humanitarian crisis but also 
brought market upheaval around the world."
"There 
have been substantial price rises, particularly on the 
energy and commodity markets, and significant 
increases in interest and inflation rates have been 
observed internationally."
"There were some signs of 
normalization in the markets during the course of 
fiscal year 2023."
"Against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war and 
the resulting consequences, Volkswagen had 
decided to suspend vehicle production in Russia for 
the time being."
"Vehicle exports to Russia have also 
been halted."
"In addition, the respective sanction 
requirements must also be complied with in relation 
to parts supplies and the provision of technical 
information."

There was again no easing of the Russia-Ukraine 
war in the fiscal year 2023."
"For this reason, the 
discontinuation of business activities in Russia 
continued to take concrete shape in the Volkswagen 
Group."
"In this context, further sales negotiations 
with a number of investors continued or were 
concluded."
"On 
registration of the transaction on 22 May 2023, 
ownership of the shares in Volkswagen Group Rus 
was transferred from the seller to the buyer."
"In this context, the Volkswagen Group had already 
made significant impairments in the fiscal year 2022 
and recognized appropriate provisions."
"The selling 
price amounted to €0.1 billion."
"The deconsolidation 
of the affected companies resulted in a loss of  
€0.4 billion in the fiscal year 2023 at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group."
"Apart from winding down Volkswagen Group Rus 
and its subsidiaries, no additional material expenses 
were recognized in connection with the Russia-
Ukraine war in the fiscal year 2023."
"For further details, please refer to the sections 
“Business development”, “Results of operations of 
the Volkswagen Group”, “Opportunities and risks of 
the Volkswagen Group” and “Anticipated 
development of the Volkswagen Group”."
"In this 
context, Volkswagen AG announced that noticeable 
discrepancies between the figures recorded in 
testing and those measured in actual road use had 
been identified in type EA 189 diesel engines and 
that this engine type had been installed in roughly 
eleven million vehicles worldwide."
"On 2 November 
2015, the EPA issued a notice of violation alleging 
that irregularities had also been discovered in the 
software installed in US vehicles with type V6 3.0 l 
diesel engines."
"This software function was developed and 
implemented from 2006 on without knowledge at 
the level of the board of management."
"Members of 
the board of management did not learn of the 
development and implementation of this software 
function until the summer of 2015."
"No material special items in connection with the 
diesel issue were recognized at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group in the fiscal year 2023."
"For 
further information on the legal risks in connection 
with the diesel issue, please refer to the section 
“Opportunities and risks of future development” as 
well as note [2] of the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements for the fiscal year 2023."
"In its settlement decision of July 2016, 
the European Commission assessed fines against 
five European truck manufacturers."
"MAN’s fine was 
waived in full as the company had informed the 
European Commission about the irregularities as a 
key witness."
"In September 2017, the European 
Commission fined Scania €0.88 billion."
"In a 
judgment rendered in February 2022, the European 
General Court (Court of First Instance) rejected in its 
entirety the appeal filed by Scania in this connection."
"Scania’s April 2022 appeal against this judgment 
was rejected in full by the European Court of Justice, 
the court of last resort, in February 2024."
"Furthermore, antitrust lawsuits seeking damages 
have been received from customers."
"As is the case 
in any antitrust proceedings, this may result in 
further lawsuits for damages."
"No provisions have 
been recognized at the level of the Volkswagen 
Group for a large number of these legal disputes as 
they are not expected to result in final damage 
awards at the highest appeals level."
"For those 
actions in which, after re-assessing the risks, the 
final outcome at the highest appeals level appears 
more likely than not to result in the payment of 
damages by MAN or Scania, provisions have been 
recognized in an amount of €89 million at the level 
of the Volkswagen Group."
"Volkswagen AG has not 
disclosed contingent liabilities in its consolidated 
financial statements as it is currently not possible to 
quantify them."
"This applies in particular to the 
proceedings that are currently at an early stage – 
including those as to which the process of expert 
assessment is still at an early stage."
"In March 2022, the European Commission and the 
Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), the 
English antitrust authorities, searched the premises 
of various automotive manufacturers and 
automotive industry organizations and/or served 
them with formal requests for information."
"In the 
Volkswagen Group, the investigation affects 
Volkswagen Group UK, which was searched by the 
CMA, and Volkswagen AG, which has received a 
Group-wide information request from the European 
Commission."
"Also alleged is an agreement to refrain 
from competitive use of ELV issues, that is, not to 
publicize relevant recycling data (recyclates, 
recyclability, recovery) for competitive purposes."
"The 
violation under investigation is alleged to have taken 
place in particular in the “ACEA” Working Group 
Recycling and related sub-groups thereof."
"Volkswagen AG is responding to the European 
Commission’s information requests."
"Volkswagen 
Group UK is cooperating with the CMA."
"In this 
matter, CMA furthermore issued requests for 
information to Volkswagen AG."
"In July 2022, 
Volkswagen AG filed an action for judicial review 
challenging the CMA’s requests for information in 
particular because Volkswagen AG believes that they 
exceed the CMA’s jurisdiction."
"In February 2023, the 
court granted the claim."
"The CMA appealed this 
judgment in April 2023, and in January 2024 the 
appellate court ruled in the CMA’s favor."
"Volkswagen 
AG is considering whether to appeal this decision."
"Concurrent therewith, Volkswagen AG continues to 
examine the possibilities for reasonable cooperation 
with the CMA."
"In addition, a few national and international 
authorities initiated antitrust investigations."
"Volkswagen is cooperating closely with the 
responsible authorities in these investigations."
"An 
assessment of the underlying situation by 
Volkswagen is not possible at this early stage."
"In view of the change in external conditions, the 
disposal project is expected to be completed within 
the fiscal year 2024."
"An impairment loss of €25 
million was recognized at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group for the disposal group as of 
31 December 2022."
"As of 31 December 2023, 
another minor impairment loss and offsetting 
currency translation effects were identified at the 
level of the Volkswagen Group."
"Once the resolution had 
been passed by the competent bodies, the 
implementation of a disposal plan was started and 
expected to be completed in 2023."
"However, it 
could not be finalized as an approval by the Russian 
authorities was still outstanding as of 31 December 
2023."
"It is expected that the outstanding approval 
will ultimately be granted and the disposal plan 
therefore completed in the first half of 2024."
"Impairment losses of €186 million were recognized 
in this context at the level of the Volkswagen Group 
in the period up to 31 December 2023."
"The 
companies, OOO Volkswagen Group Finanz, 
Moscow, Russia, and OOO Volkswagen Financial 
Services RUS, Moscow, Russia, were sold after the 
end of the fiscal year, on 18 January 2024."
"Ltd., Harbin, 
China, and its subsidiaries under German and Swiss 
law."
"Following approval by the competent 
authorities, the transaction is expected to be 
completed within the fiscal year 2024."
"In accordance with IFRS 5, the assets and liabilities 
held for sale were recognized at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less expected costs of 
disposal."
"For the 
business development of the Porsche SE Group, 
please refer to the sections “Significant events and 
developments at the Porsche SE Group” and 
“Results of operations, financial position and net 
assets”."
"Developments in the global economy 
In the reporting year, general economic 
development was primarily shaped by the Russia-
Ukraine war (see also section “Significant events 
and developments at the Volkswagen Group”)."
"The slowdown in economic momentum 
versus the prior year was mainly due to weaker 
growth in the advanced economies, whereas the 
overall rate of change in the emerging markets 
increased somewhat."
"At national level, developments depended on the 
one hand on the intensity with which central banks 
had to tighten monetary policy to curb the higher 
inflation, mainly by raising interest rates and 
reducing bond holdings, which had a negative 
impact on consumer spending and investment 
activity."
"On the other hand, the extent to which 
national economies were affected by the  
 
 
consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war was a 
decisive factor."
"Prices for energy and many other 
raw materials were lower than in the prior year, and 
shortages of intermediate products and 
commodities eased somewhat."
"Global trade in 
goods expressed in nominal terms decreased in the 
reporting year."
"Trends in the markets for passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles 
In the fiscal year 2023, the volume of the passenger 
car market worldwide was noticeably higher than in 
the prior year at 76.6 million vehicles."
"Most markets 
registered growth, which together with weak prior-
year figures was attributable to the fact that 
shortages and disruption in global supply chains 
eased restricting vehicle availability to a lesser 
extent."
"While the supply situation for intermediates 
improved compared with 2022, the trend in new 
registrations in individual markets dampened at the 
end of the prior year, partly as a consequence of the 
Russia-Ukraine war and pull-forward effects 
generated by state subsidies expiring."
"Significant or strong growth was recorded in the 
overall markets of the Western Europe, Central and 
Eastern Europe, Middle East and North America 
regions."
"The markets of the South America region 
were slightly higher and the markets of the Asia-
Pacific region noticeably higher than the prior-year 
level."
"The market in Africa fell slightly short of the 
prior-year volume."
"In the reporting year, the global volume of new 
registrations for light commercial vehicles was on a 
level with the prior year (down 0.2%)."
"Global truck markets 
grew significantly, due in particular to a recovery of 
the Chinese market following the end of the 
country’s zero-Covid strategy."
"Demand in the bus markets relevant for the 
Volkswagen Group was significantly higher than in 
the prior year (up 23.2%)."
"Trends in the markets for power engineering 
The markets for power engineering are influenced 
by varying regional and economic factors."
"Consequently, the business growth trends of the 
respective markets develop mostly independently of 
one another."
"In 2023, the marine market remained at a similar 
level to the prior year."
"There was reticence in the 
market for energy generation in 2023, particularly in 
Europe."
"This was due to the gas supply issues and 
the continued lack of a finalized framework for the 
future operation of power plants on the part of 
policymakers."
"There was more movement in the 
turbomachinery market than in the prior year."
"Trends in the markets for financial services  
Demand for automotive financial services was at a 
high level in the fiscal year 2023; however, higher 
interest rates put pressure on demand for financial 
services in almost all regions."
"Volkswagen Group deliveries 
The Volkswagen Group delivered 9.2 million 
vehicles to customers worldwide in the fiscal year 
2023."
"This was 11.8% or 1.0 million units more than 
in the prior year, which had suffered in particular 
from the limited availability of Volkswagen Group 
models caused by the continued shortage of 
semiconductors, and from the Russia-Ukraine war."
"Parts supply shortages continued to have an 
adverse effect in the reporting year."
"In addition, 
disruptions in logistics chains had a negative effect; 
however, this effect diminished in the course of the 
year."
"Sales of both passenger cars and commercial 
vehicles were up year on year."
"With the exception of Bentley, all brands in the 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles 
business areas at the Volkswagen Group delivered 
more vehicles to customers than in the prior year."
"Volkswagen recorded an increase in deliveries to 
customers in all major individual markets as well as 
in all sales regions around the world."

The group’s e-mobility campaign continued to  
move ahead successfully; Volkswagen delivered  
0.8 million all-electric vehicles to customers 
worldwide in the reporting year."
"This was 0.2 million 
or 34.7% more units than in the prior year."
"Their 
share of the group’s total deliveries rose to 8.3% 
(6.9%)."
"Deliveries to customers of our plug-in hybrid 
models amounted to 0.3 million (up 4.4%)."
"Total 
electric vehicle deliveries went up by 25.6% and 
their share of total Volkswagen Group deliveries 
rose year on year to 11.1% (9.9%)."
"In an overall global market that saw noticeable 
growth, the Volkswagen Group achieved a 
passenger car market share of 11.1% (11.0%)."
"In the fiscal year 2023, the Volkswagen Group 
delivered 10.7% more commercial vehicles to 
customers worldwide than in the prior year."
"Volkswagen handed over a total of 0.3 million 
commercial vehicles to customers."
"Prior-year deliveries have been updated to reflect subsequent statistical 
trends."
"The prior-year 
figure had been impacted in particular by the limited 
vehicle availability due to bottlenecks in the supply 
of parts caused by the shortage of semiconductors 
and the Russia-Ukraine war."
"Persistent parts supply 
shortages had a negative effect in the reporting year 
and disruption in the global logistics chains also led 
to delays, though these eased as the year progressed."
"Unit sales outside Germany rose by 9.5% to  
8.2 million vehicles."
"Growth was seen above all in 
the USA, the United Kingdom and Türkiye, while 
fewer vehicles were sold in China."
"Unit sales in 
Germany increased by 17.2% year on year."
"The 
proportion of the group’s total unit sales attributable 
to Germany increased to 12.6% (11.9%)."
"Parts supply shortages impacted production in the 
fiscal year 2023."
"Production in Germany increased 
by 16.2% to 1.9 million vehicles."
"The proportion of 
the group’s total production accounted for by 
Germany increased to 20.6% (18.9%)."
"Global inventories of new vehicles at Volkswagen 
Group companies and in the dealer organization 
were higher at the end of the reporting year than at 
year-end 2022."
"The effect of disruption in the 
logistics chains continued to have a negative impact 
in the reporting year which eased as the year 
progressed."
"Volkswagen Group financial services 
The products and services of the Volkswagen 
Group’s financial services division were popular in 
the fiscal year 2023."
"However, limited vehicle 
availability caused by parts supply shortages and 
disruptions in logistics chains weighed on demand."
"The number of new financing, leasing, service and 
insurance contracts signed worldwide increased by 
11.3% to 9.5 million."
"The ratio of leased and 
financed vehicles to group deliveries (penetration 
rate) in the financial services division’s markets 
stood at 32.8% in the reporting year, on a level with 
the prior year."
"The total number of contracts stood 
at 24.6 million (24.5 million) on 31 December 2023."

"The total number of contracts stood 
at 24.6 million (24.5 million) on 31 December 2023."
1 The dealer organization comprises all VW Group external dealer companies that are supplied by the Volkswagen Group.
"While the prior-year figures for the results of 
operations relate to the period from 1 January to 
31 December 2022, the financial position and net 
assets use figures as of 31 December 2022 as 
comparative figures."
"As a result of the first-time application of IFRS 17, 
which provides new guidance on the accounting for 
insurance contracts, adjustments were made to 
prior-year figures at the level of the Volkswagen 
Group including the Porsche AG Group."
"These 
changes are due primarily to the changed system 
for calculating provisions related to the insurance 
business."
"At the level of Porsche SE, there are no 
business transactions that fall within the scope of 
IFRS 17."
"This caused the 
result from investments accounted for at equity for 
the fiscal year 2022 to increase by €5 million."
"With 
regard to the investments accounted for at equity, 
there were no material balance sheet effects as of 
31 December 2022."
"Already in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
2023, the preference shares were therefore no longer 
classified as assets held for sale, resulting in a 
retrospective application of the equity method."
"The 
capital share, which the at equity accounting for the 
investment in Volkswagen AG has since been based 
on, amounts to around 31.9% compared to the 
approximately 31.4% previously."
"The retrospective 
application of the equity method required the prior-
year comparative figures to be adjusted."
"On the one 
hand, the preference shares are no longer 
recognized as assets held for sale previously 
amounting to €314 million."
"On the other hand, this 
resulted in an increase in the carrying amount of the 
investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at 
equity of €1,040 million, an increase in deferred tax 
liabilities of €4 million as well as an increase in equity 
of €723 million."
"This increased the result from 
investments for the fiscal year 2022 by €703 million, 
while the deferred income tax income incurred 
thereon decreased by €3 million."
"In the prior year, €96 million related 
to discontinued operations."
"In turn, of the result 
after tax from continuing operations, €5,107 million 
(€5,399 million) relates to the core investments 
segment and minus €12 million (minus €3 million) to 
the portfolio investments segment."
"The decrease in 
the group result after tax is due in particular to a 
non-cash valuation effect in connection with the 
acquired Volkswagen preference shares in the 
amount of €597 million in the prior year."
"There were 
no direct significant currency, crisis or investment 
(or divestiture) effects at the level of Porsche SE in 
the reporting year."
"The combined group 
management report for the fiscal year 2022 forecast 
a group result after tax of between €4.5 billion and 
€6.5 billion for the fiscal year 2023."
"On 20 October 
2023, Porsche SE also announced that it expects a 
group result after tax in the lower half of the forecast 
corridor."
"The group result after tax was within the 
forecast corridor."
"Other comprehensive income of the Porsche SE 
Group of minus €1,132 million (€3,652 million) 
mainly contains effects resulting from the 
investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at 
equity totaling minus €1,033 million (€3,529 million) 
after taking deferred taxes into account."
"At the level of Porsche 
SE, other comprehensive income primarily contains

Results of operations of the  
Porsche SE Group 
The result after tax of the Porsche SE Group came 
to €5,096 million (€5,492 million) in the fiscal year 
2023, relating entirely to continuing operations 
(€5,396 million)."
"In the prior year, €96 million related

effects from the measurement of interest rate 
hedging instruments concluded by Porsche SE 
under hedge accounting in an amount of minus  
€72 million (€90 million) after taking deferred taxes

"2 Notes [4], [5] and [12] of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2023 contain additional disclosures on 
investments accounted for at equity."
"This 
contains profit contributions from ongoing at equity 
accounting before purchase price allocations of 
€5,111 million (€4,716 million) as well as 
subsequent effects from purchase price allocations 
of minus €262 million (minus €59 million)."
"The 
increase in subsequent effects from purchase price 
allocations is attributable to impairment losses on 
amortized hidden reserves as a result of 
impairment tests at the level of the Volkswagen 
Group and is related to investments of the 
Volkswagen Group accounted for at equity."
"These 
were recognized in an ancillary calculation to the 
carrying amount accounted for at equity and are 
included in the effects from purchase price 
allocations in the amount of €232 million."
"The prior-
year result from investments in Volkswagen AG 
accounted for at equity also included non-cash 
income of €597 million from the acquisition of 
Volkswagen preference shares."
"This was a result of 
the difference between the proportionate 
remeasured equity of the Volkswagen Group and 
the acquisition costs for the Volkswagen preference 
shares."
"With regard to the development in the 
result at the level of the Volkswagen Group, please 
also refer to the sections “Significant events and 
developments at the Volkswagen Group” and 
“Results of operations of the Volkswagen Group”."
"The result from the investment in Porsche AG 
accounted for at equity, the second core investment, 
amounted to €391 million (€12 million) in the 
reporting period."
"This contains profit contributions 
from ongoing at equity accounting before the 
purchase price allocation of €643 million (€162 
million) as well as subsequent effects from the 
purchase price allocation of minus €252 million 
(minus €150 million)."
"In the prior year, the result was 
only attributed to Porsche SE from 29 September 
2022."
"Other operating income, personnel expenses, 
amortization and depreciation, the financial result 
and income tax income of the core investments 
segment virtually match the amounts for the group 
as a whole."
"Other operating income from the reporting period 
includes income of €218 million from a contractual 
claim for compensation against Volkswagen AG."
"This 
resulted from a compensation mechanism in the 
contribution agreement, based on tax benefits and 
tax disadvantages, in connection with the 
contribution of the holding business operations of 
Porsche SE to Volkswagen AG in the fiscal year 2012."
"In return, Volkswagen AG has undertaken 
to reimburse Porsche SE for any tax advantages of 
the companies transferred as well as their legal 
predecessors and subsidiaries relating to tax 
assessment periods up to 31 July 2009."
"After the 
tax field audit of Porsche AG for the assessment 
period 2009 was substantively completed in the 
third quarter of 2023, the findings of the tax field 
audit of Porsche AG were accepted by Porsche SE 
which is liable for the tax payments as the former 
ultimate tax parent."
"In the prior year, €177 million of other operating 
income related to the proportionate realization of an 
intercompany profit that was eliminated in the fiscal 
year 2012."
"This intercompany profit was attributable 
to the contribution of the holding business 
operations of Porsche SE to Volkswagen AG in the 
fiscal year 2012."
"The sale of preference shares of 
Porsche AG by Volkswagen to third parties in the 
course of the IPO of Porsche AG triggered the 
proportionate realization of this intercompany profit 
in the prior year."
"Other operating expenses decreased largely due  
to lower consulting fees year on year to a total of  
€18 million (€25 million)."
"The financial result of minus €269 million (minus  
€57 million) contains financing expenses of minus 
€293 million (minus €71 million)."
"The increase is 
related to the interest period recognized for the 
whole year for the first time in the reporting year."
"Other financial result of €24 million (€14 million), 
which largely comprises interest income from fixed-
term deposits, had an opposite effect."
"In the prior 
year, other financial result mainly included effects 
from the fair value measurement of interest rate 
derivatives to which hedge accounting was not 
applied in the amount of €13 million."
"The 
negative segment result from investments 
accounted for at equity is also related in particular 
to subsequent effects from purchase price 
allocations at the level of ETS and the early life 
cycle phase of the portfolio companies, in which no 
profits are typically recorded."
"The result after tax from discontinued operations in 
the comparative period resulted from the 
deconsolidation gain on disposal of the share in 
PTV Planung Transport Verkehr GmbH, Karlsruhe 
(“PTV”, together with its subsidiaries the “PTV 
Group”)."
"In 
the combined group management report for the 
fiscal year 2022, net debt1 of the Porsche SE Group 
as of 31 December 2023 was forecast to range 
between €5.6 billion and €6.1 billion."
"In the group 
quarterly statement for the third quarter of 2023, 
Porsche SE announced that net debt at the end of 
the year was expected to be in the lower half of the 
forecast range.2 Net debt as of 31 December 2023 
was within the corridor forecast."
"Porsche SE’s special dividend claim against 
Volkswagen AG of €3.1 billion was offset against the 
remaining purchase price liability for Porsche SE’s 
acquisition of ordinary shares in Porsche AG to 
Volkswagen of €3.0 billion."
"No capital gains tax was 
deducted from these dividend inflows."
"In the 
comparative period, the gross dividend from 
Volkswagen of €1,201 million for the fiscal year 
2021 attributable to Porsche SE was initially subject 
to capital gains tax plus solidarity surcharge of 
26.375% or €317 million."
"In the reporting period, the 
cash inflow from operating activities under income 
tax received includes a €316 million corporate 
income tax refund, which is largely due to this 
capital gains tax deduction."
"This was offset by cash 
outflows in the reporting period of €248 million  
(€52 million) primarily for interest paid including 
transaction costs in connection with the debt capital 
raised."
"Both the reporting and the comparative

Financial position of the Porsche SE Group 
Net debt of the Porsche SE Group, i.e., financial 
liabilities less cash and cash equivalents, time 
deposits and securities, decreased to €5,717 million 
(€6,672 million) compared to 31 December 2022."
"In 
the combined group management report for the 
fiscal year 2022, net debt1 of the Porsche SE Group 
as of 31 December 2023 was forecast to range 
between €5.6 billion and €6.1 billion."
"In the group 
quarterly statement for the third quarter of 2023, 
Porsche SE announced that net debt at the end of 
the year was expected to be in the lower half of the 
forecast range.2 Net debt as of 31 December 2023 
was within the corridor forecast."
"Porsche SE’s special dividend claim against 
Volkswagen AG of €3.1 billion was offset against the 
remaining purchase price liability for Porsche SE’s 
acquisition of ordinary shares in Porsche AG to 
Volkswagen of €3.0 billion."
"No capital gains tax was 
deducted from these dividend inflows."
"In the 
comparative period, the gross dividend from 
Volkswagen of €1,201 million for the fiscal year 
2021 attributable to Porsche SE was initially subject 
to capital gains tax plus solidarity surcharge of 
26.375% or €317 million."
"In the reporting period, the 
cash inflow from operating activities under income 
tax received includes a €316 million corporate 
income tax refund, which is largely due to this 
capital gains tax deduction."
"This was offset by cash 
outflows in the reporting period of €248 million  
(€52 million) primarily for interest paid including 
transaction costs in connection with the debt capital 
raised."
"Both the reporting and the comparative 
period include cash outflows for expenses relating 
to holding business operations."

There was a cash outflow from investing activities of 
€243 million (€7,287 million) in the fiscal year 2023."
"In the 
comparative period, the cash outflow from investing 
activities is largely attributable to cash paid for the 
acquisition of ordinary shares in Porsche AG of 
€7,075 million (including acquisition-related costs)."
"Additional cash outflows in the comparative period 
are attributable to cash paid for acquiring 
preference shares in Volkswagen AG of €400 million 
as well as for participating in a capital increase of 
ETS of €35 million."
"In contrast, the comparative 
period also included a cash inflow from the sale of 
shares in PTV of €226 million less the cash and 
cash equivalents of the PTV Group of €25 million 
disposed of in the course of the deconsolidation."
"There was a cash outflow from financing activities 
of €1,222 million (cash inflow: €6,286 million) in the 
fiscal year 2023."
"This cash outflow resulted from the 
dividend payments made to the shareholders of 
Porsche SE of €783 million (€783 million) and the 
repayment of bank loans and the bridge loan in 
excess of the refinancing from the Schuldschein 
loan and the bonds of €439 million."
"In the prior year, 
the cash inflow was due in particular to raising debt 
capital for the purchase price payment of the 
ordinary shares of Porsche AG of €7,070 million."
"Cash and cash equivalents increased to  
€494 million (€86 million) compared to 31 December 
2022."
"In addition to that, Porsche SE has at its 
disposal an undrawn credit facility with a volume of 
€1.0 billion and a term until at least September 2026."
"Net assets of the Porsche SE Group 
Compared to 31 December 2022, the Porsche SE 
Group’s total assets increased by €2.8 billion to 
€62.4 billion as of 31 December 2023."
"The Porsche SE Group’s non-current assets of 
€61.3 billion (€58.7 billion) primarily relate to the 
core investments accounted for at equity."
"These 
include in particular the carrying amount of the 
investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at 
equity, which increased by €2.4 billion to  
€50.7 billion."
"In addition, 
adjustments directly recorded in equity at the level 
of the Volkswagen Group increased the carrying 
amount by €15 million."
"Allocated dividends of 
€1,393 million reduced the carrying amount."
"For 
explanations of the changes in carrying amount 
recognized through profit or loss or other 
comprehensive income, please also refer to the 
section “Results of operations of the Porsche SE 
Group”."

Porsche AG accounted for at equity increased by

€227 million to €10.4 billion compared to 
31 December 2022."
"Allocated dividends of €114 million reduced the 
carrying amount."
"In addition, adjustments directly 
recorded in equity at the level of the Porsche AG 
Group reduced the carrying amount by minus  
€9 million."
"For explanations of the changes in 
carrying amount recognized through profit or loss  
or other comprehensive income, please also refer to 
the section “Results of operations of the Porsche SE 
Group”."
"The decrease in the carrying 
amount is largely due to the interest rate hedging 
instruments settled in the course of refinancing."
"The 
remaining interest rate hedging instruments show a 
decrease in fair value as of the reporting sheet date 
and are included in non-current other financial 
assets in the amount of €3 million and in non-
current other financial liabilities in the amount of  
€43 million."
"Current assets of €1,030 million (€762 million) 
mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents, time 
deposits and securities."
"In the prior year, current 
assets also included income tax receivables totaling 
€316 million."
"These were largely attributable to 
withheld capital gains tax for dividend payments 
received from Volkswagen AG and were refunded in 
the reporting period."
"The equity of the Porsche SE Group increased  
to a total of €55.3 billion (€52.1 billion) due to the 
positive total comprehensive income as of 
31 December 2023."
"The equity ratio of 88.7% 
(87.6%) increased compared to the end of the fiscal 
year 2022."
"A first bond with a 
volume of €750 million was issued in April 2023 as 
part of a debt issuance program set up in the fiscal 
year 2023."
"The bridge loan was repaid in full using 
the Schuldschein loan, the first bond and also using 
the dividend payment from Volkswagen AG."
"In 
addition, Porsche SE issued a bond with a volume 
of €500 million and a bond with a volume of  
€750 million in June 2023."
"The proceeds from these 
two bonds were used for the partial repayment of 
the five-year bank loan (see also section “Significant 
events and developments at the Porsche SE Group”)."
"As a result of the refinancing, the maturity profile  
of the financial liabilities has changed, as has the 
presentation of maturities in the consolidated 
balance sheet."
"Of the total financial liabilities of  
€6.7 billion (€7.1 billion), €6.6 billion (€3.2 billion)  
is classified as non-current and €0.1 billion  
(€3.9 billion) as current as of 31 December 2023."
"It should be noted that the result of 
the Volkswagen Group, where it relates to the 
shareholders of Volkswagen AG, is only reflected in 
the group result of Porsche SE in the course of at 
equity accounting."
"In the period from January to December 2023,  
the Volkswagen Group’s revenue amounted to 
€322.3 billion, up 15.5% on the prior-year figure."
"This was mainly attributable to a rise in volume and 
beneficial changes in the price positioning and in 
the mix."
"These factors were offset by exchange rate 
effects."
"The prior-year period had been impacted to 
an even greater extent by limited vehicle availability 
due to parts supply shortages."
"The Volkswagen 
Group generated 81.5% (82.6%) of its revenue 
abroad."
"Gross profit (revenue less cost of sales) 
increased by €8.8 billion to €61.0 billion."
"The gross 
margin was 18.9% (18.7%)."
"In the fiscal year 2023, the Volkswagen Group’s 
operating result of €22.6 billion (€22.1 billion) was 
on a level with the prior year."
"The operating return 
on sales was 7.0% (7.9%)."
"In particular, higher 
vehicle sales and improved price positioning were 
set against a rise in product costs (in particular for 
commodities)."
"In the fiscal year 
2023, there were no material special items in 
connection with the diesel issue (€0.4 billion)."
"The 
deconsolidation of Volkswagen Group Rus and its 
subsidiaries led to a loss of €0.4 billion in 2023."
"In 
the prior year, the result had been impacted mainly 
by expenses relating to loss allowances and risk 
provisions due to the direct impact of the Russia-
Ukraine war and special items in connection with 
the diesel issue."
"The financial result increased by 
€0.7 billion to €0.6 billion."
"The share of the result of 
investments accounted for at equity was slightly 
below that of the prior year."
"In the interest result, 
higher interest income was not sufficient to offset 
the rise in interest expenses resulting primarily from 
changes in the interest rates used to measure 
provisions."
"The other financial result was affected in 
the reporting year among other things by adverse 
exchange rate effects, especially as a result of the 
sharp depreciation of the Argentinian peso."
"This 
was set against lower non-cash expenses from 
adjustments to the carrying amounts of investees 
because of changes in share prices and impairment 
tests, and against positive net income from 
securities and funds."
"In the prior-year period, the 
impairment loss recognized on the equity 
investment in Argo AI and changes in share prices 
affecting net income from securities and funds, 
particularly as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, 
had both had a negative impact."
"The Volkswagen Group’s result before tax was up 
€1.1 billion to €23.2 billion in the fiscal year 2023."
"The return on sales before tax declined to 7.2% 
(7.9%)."
"Income taxes resulted in an expense of  
€5.3 billion (€6.2 billion), which in turn led to a tax 
rate of 22.7% (28.2%)."
"The result after tax was 
noticeably up on the prior year, at €17.9 billion 
(€15.9 billion)."
"The result after tax and non-
controlling interests increased by €1.1 billion to 
€16.0 billion."

Results of operations  
of the Porsche AG Group 
The following statements relate to the original 
profit/loss figures of the Porsche AG Group in the 
fiscal year 2023."
"It should be noted that the group 
result of Porsche SE only reflects its capital share in 
the result of the Porsche AG Group – in addition to 
being included via the result of the Volkswagen 
Group – in the course of at equity accounting."
"The Porsche AG Group generated revenue of  
€40.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023."
"This is an 
increase of 7.7% on the prior year (€37.6 billion) and 
is largely due to higher vehicle sales coupled with 
positive product mix and price effects."
"The 
development of the Chinese renminbi and US dollar 
currencies in particular had the opposite effect on 
revenue."
"The cost of sales rose by €1.8 billion to €28.9 billion 
(€27.1 billion) and was therefore in proportion to 
revenue at 71.4% (72.0%)."
"Despite supplier cost 
increases, cost of sales increased less thanks to 
changes in the product mix."
"Gross profit increased accordingly by 10.0% to 
€11.6 billion (€10.5 billion), therefore resulting in a 
gross margin of 28.6% (28.0%)."
"Distribution expenses increased by €0.5 billion to 
€2.9 billion."
"In proportion to revenue, these 
increased to 7.1% (6.3%)."
"The increase is due, 
among other things, to increased sales activities."
"Administrative expenses increased from €1.7 billion 
to €1.8 billion."
"The operating result of the Porsche 
AG Group increased by €0.5 billion to €7.3 billion in 
the fiscal year 2023 (€6.8 billion)."
"The operating 
return on sales of the Porsche AG Group thus stood 
at 18.0% (18.0%)."
"The financial result came to €91 million  
(€308 million)."
"The decline is mainly due to lower 
interest income as a result of the spin-off of the loan 
receivable from Porsche Holding Stuttgart GmbH 
implemented as part of the IPO."
"In addition, 
adjusted interest rates used to measure provisions 
had a negative impact on the financial result."
"By 
contrast, the securities held in special funds 
benefited in particular from the overall positive 
development of the capital markets and the higher 
interest rate level."
"Additionally, the financial result 
was positively impacted by a reversal of an 
impairment loss on Bertrandt AG that has been 
accounted for at equity."
"Due to the higher effective tax rate of 30.1% 
(29.9%), income tax did not increase in proportion 
to the profit before tax, rising to €2.2 billion  
(€2.1 billion)."
"The increase in the tax rate is due to  
a shift from lower taxed countries to higher taxed 
countries, tax effects from planned dividends and 
lower effects from the elimination of intercompany 
profits compared to the prior year."
"As a result, the 
result after tax increased by €0.2 billion to  
€5.2 billion in the reporting period."
"At the level of the 
two core investments – Volkswagen AG and 
Porsche AG – business was largely impacted in the 
fiscal year 2023 by a challenging global market 
environment, parts supply shortages and 
disruptions in the logistics chain."
"In addition, the 
industry is shaped by fierce competition, 
technological transformation and increasing 
ecological awareness."
"The result after tax of the Porsche SE Group 
decreased by 7.2% year on year to €5.1 billion, 
mainly as a result of the non-cash income of  
€0.6 billion included in the prior year in connection 
with the acquisition of Volkswagen preference 
shares."
"Without taking this effect into account, the 
result after tax of Porsche SE would have increased 
on the prior year."
"The result after tax is within the 
corridor forecast in the prior year."
"In the fiscal  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
year 2023, the results of operations of the  
Porsche SE Group were largely characterized by 
the development of the Volkswagen Group including 
the Porsche AG Group."
"The net debt of the Porsche SE Group  
decreased from €6,672 million in the prior year to 
€5,717 million and is within the corridor forecast in 
the prior year."
"The financial position of the Porsche 
SE Group was primarily influenced by the receipt 
and payment of dividends, the receipt of income tax 
refunds, the claim for compensation against 
Volkswagen AG and the repayment of the bank 
financing in excess of the refinancing."
"The board of management of Porsche SE is still fully 
committed to the company’s role as Volkswagen 
AG’s long-term anchor shareholder and remains 
convinced of the Volkswagen Group’s potential for 
increasing value."
"The risk management system of the Porsche SE 
Group monitors both the direct risks at the level of 
Porsche SE as well as the significant indirect and 
direct risks from investments described below."
"The 
investments generally have their own independent 
risk management system and are responsible for 
managing their own risks."
"The risk management 
system can therefore be divided into the sphere of 
Porsche SE as holding company and the sphere of 
its investments."
"In its risk management system, Porsche SE focuses 
on risks that may cause the company to negatively 
deviate from its targets."
"However, on occasion 
potential opportunities are also analyzed and 
presented."
"The risk management system is designed to ensure 
that the management of Porsche SE is always 
informed of significant risk drivers and able to 
assess the potential impact of the identified risks in 
order to take appropriate countermeasures at an 
early stage."
"The Porsche SE Group’s risk management system 
is updated on an ongoing basis and adapted to the 
company’s changing requirements."
"Assessing the 
probability and extent of future events and 
developments is, by its nature, subject to 
uncertainty."
"A risk management system cannot 
foresee all potential risks, nor can it completely 
prevent or uncover irregular acts."
"Risk management system of Porsche SE 
The risk management system of the Porsche SE 
Group monitors and manages the direct risks at the 
level of the holding operations of Porsche SE."
"Moreover, the holding level considers in particular 
the significant indirect risks from investments."
"The risk management system of Porsche SE is 
significantly shaped by the existing risk culture and 
is subdivided into three lines of defense: 
“operational risk management”, “strategic risk 
management” and “review-based risk management”."
"Opportunities and risks of future development

The risk culture as part of the corporate culture 
comprises the fundamental attitude to risks and the 
way they are dealt with."
"It strongly influences the 
company’s risk awareness."
"The risk culture within 
the Porsche SE Group is shaped by the practiced 
behavior of the management, the creation and 
promotion of a company-wide risk awareness and 
open and transparent risk communication."
"As the first line of defense, “operational risk 
management” comprises analysis, management, 
monitoring, communication and documentation of 
risks at an operational level."
"Porsche SE 
distinguishes between two types of risk."
"The first 
type of risk comprises risks from business activities 
which are entered into as part of (conscious) 
entrepreneurial decisions (“entrepreneurial risks”)."
"The second type of risk comprises risks resulting 
from the lack of a definition or insufficient 
compliance with processes (“organizational risks”)."
"The two types of risk may generally also include 
sustainability aspects."
"Every single department 
within Porsche SE is responsible for identifying, 
evaluating, managing, monitoring and documenting 
risks in its area and reporting significant risks to the 
finance department."
"In particular, this means that 
measures for managing risks are derived and 
implemented immediately at this level in all areas of 
the company, with the aim of preventing these risks 
from spreading to other areas or even to the 
company as a whole."
"With regard to the 
organizational risks, operational risk management is 
performed using the internal control system, which 
is described in the section “Internal control system 
including internal control system of Porsche SE 
relevant for the financial reporting process”."
"In 
addition to operational management of the specific 
individual risk areas at department level, the finance 
department also creates a complete view of the 
significant risks in order to take into consideration 
the overall risk exposure of the group."
"Risks are 
aggregated to appropriately take into account 
combined effects of risks."
"In this context, risk-
bearing capacity is regularly determined based on 
Porsche SE’s net assets."
"To assess the existence of 
any developments that may jeopardize the ability of 
the company to continue as a going concern, the 
aggregated risks are compared to Porsche SE’s net 
assets based on scenarios."
"The second line of defense, “strategic risk 
management”, is responsible for the conceptual 
design and control of the proper implementation of 
the entire risk management system."
"The third line of defense, “review-based risk 
management”, aims to ensure the appropriateness 
and effectiveness of the risk management system 
and therefore in particular that the operational and 
strategic risk management are in line with externally 
and internally defined standards."
"Furthermore, the strategic level 
is reviewed to determine whether there is a 
structured systems approach and whether the 
respective controls and reviews are performed in 
strategic risk management."
"The internal audit 
reports the audit findings to the board of 
management and the supervisory board’s audit 
committee."
"Internal control system including internal 
control system of Porsche SE relevant for 
the financial reporting process 
The aim of Porsche SE’s internal control system is 
to manage the organizational risks as part of 
operational risk management."
"Hence, it serves in 
particular to ensure the definition of and compliance 
with processes and is essentially based on the 
principles, guidelines and measures introduced by 
the board of management."
"The scope of the internal 
control system covers Porsche SE and its fully 
consolidated subsidiaries."
"These are exclusively 
intermediate holding companies."
"The investment 
companies of Porsche SE, in particular Volkswagen 
AG and Porsche AG, do not fall within the scope of 
the internal control system of Porsche SE and must 
in turn ensure the establishment and monitoring of 
an appropriate and effective internal control system."
"The internal control system defines uniform 
measures to manage the organizational risks."
"Based 
on a comprehensive process map, a suitable 
organizational structure is derived for the entire 
company and the individual process steps, 
responsibilities and interfaces are derived by the 
respective process owner for the key processes."
"Controls are defined for processes and interfaces of 
particular relevance, compliance with which is 
generally monitored using the dual control principle."
"These measures are documented in process 
overviews, guidelines and checklists."
"The accounting-related internal control system aims 
to ensure the compliance and legality of internal and 
external accounting and financial reporting."
"The board of management has overall responsibility 
for the internal control system."
"Based on regular 
reporting, the board of management, the audit 
committee and the supervisory board are informed 
of risks within the Porsche SE Group."
"In principle, 
these also include organizational risks, including 
any weaknesses in the internal control system to 
the extent that these may have a significant effect 
on the risk situation of Porsche SE."
"Risk management at the level of the 
investments 
The core investments of Porsche SE generally have 
their own independent risk management system to 
monitor and manage risks at their level."
"Management of the risks of the Volkswagen Group 
is located at the level of Volkswagen AG."
"The task 
of Volkswagen AG’s risk management is to identify, 
manage and monitor existing risks at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group."
"Volkswagen AG has 
implemented its own group-wide risk management 
system and is responsible for handling its own risks."
The same applies for Porsche AG.
"This information is provided, inter alia, in 
management meetings and by forwarding risk 
reports."
The same applies for Porsche AG.
"For 
additional information on the structure of the risk 
management system at the level of the Volkswagen 
Group, reference is made to the explanations in the 
section “Risk management and control system of 
the Volkswagen Group”."
"In addition to the core investments in Volkswagen 
AG and in Porsche AG, Porsche SE indirectly holds 
additional portfolio investments in the mobility and 
industrial technology sector in the form of non-
controlling interests."
"The risks at the level of these 
investments are also managed and controlled along 
decentralized lines by the respective investments 
themselves."
"The internal control system serves 
to manage these risks."
"Porsche SE distinguishes 
between the risk areas “Reporting”, “Business 
operations”, “Digital security” and “Compliance”."
"The risk area “Reporting” relates in particular to 
internal and external reporting."
"The IFRS accounting 
manual of Porsche SE ensures uniform recognition 
and measurement."
"Accounting duties are performed 
by the investment companies included in the 
consolidated financial statements."
"The financial 
statements of Porsche SE and its fully consolidated 
subsidiaries are prepared using standard software."
"The issuance of formal instructions such as a time 
schedule as well as set reporting packages ensures 
the timely and uniform reporting to Porsche SE."
"The 
components of the reporting packages required to 
be prepared for the Porsche SE Group are set out in 
detail and updated regularly."
"Upon receipt, they are 
subjected to an analysis and plausibility check."
"Depending on the matter at hand, significant 
developments are addressed in discussions with the 
reporting companies."
"The reporting packages are processed in a certified 
consolidation system."
"Extensive checks performed 
manually and by the system aim to ensure the 
completeness and reliability of the information 
processed in the consolidated financial statements."
"For all accounting-related processes, the principle 
of dual control and plausibility checks form the 
basis of the internal control system."
"Furthermore, 
the consolidated financial statements as well as the 
figures and information contained in the reporting 
packages are subjected to variance analyses and 
analyses are performed of the composition of 
individual items."
"The same applies for the 
reconciliation of the IFRS financial information to the 
separate financial statements in accordance with 
HGB of Porsche SE."
"Suitable selection processes 
and regular training measures aim to ensure that 
employees involved in the accounting process are 
appropriately qualified."
"The combined group management report is 
prepared – in accordance with the applicable 
requirements and regulations – centrally but with the 
involvement of and in consultation with the 
investments that are significant for preparing the 
management report."
"With regard to the risk area “Business operations”, 
all departments of Porsche SE have analyzed each 
of their operating processes and interfaces and also 
defined controls for processes and interfaces of 
particular relevance and monitor that they are being 
complied with."

In light of increasing digitalization, Porsche SE is 
facing growing demands for ensuring information 
security."
"As part of Porsche SE’s risk management 
system, risks from information security are captured 
by the risk area “Digital security”."
"Porsche SE 
operates an ISO/IEC 27001-certified information 
security management system (“ISMS”), which 
covers the provision and management of IT services 
for Porsche SE’s business processes."
"With regard to the management of risks from the 
risk area “Compliance”, Porsche SE has established 
a compliance management system, that is 
specifically tasked with preventing breaches of laws, 
other legal standards, company guidelines or other 
internal company regulations."
"The compliance management of Porsche SE 
comprises the compliance organization with defined 
roles and responsibilities as well as measures and 
processes set up in the company."
"These aim to 
preemptively ensure that employee conduct is in 
line with the rules and to avoid compliance 
breaches as well as to identify, to put an end to and 
to sanction potential instances of misconduct."
"This Code of Conduct is 
supplemented and specified by internal company 
guidelines on compliance."
"In addition, Porsche SE has implemented a tax 
compliance management system to ensure 
compliance, monitoring and fulfillment of tax 
obligations at Porsche SE."
"To identify significant compliance topics and 
potential compliance risks resulting from them, 
Porsche SE performs risks analyses as part of its 
compliance management."
"Risk assessment for organizational risks 
 
The organizational risks of the Porsche SE Group 
are regularly subjected to an overall risk assessment 
using the categories low, medium or high."
"As of the 
reporting date, the four identified risk areas 
“Reporting”, “Business operations”, “Digital security” 
and “Compliance” are each classified as low."
"Entrepreneurial risks 
In the area of entrepreneurial risks, the Porsche SE 
Group primarily faces opportunities and risks from 
investments, risks from financing and financial 
instruments as well as legal and tax opportunities 
and risks."
"These are considered in terms of their 
potential influence on the earnings and liquidity 
situation of the Porsche SE Group."
"The focus of risk 
management is primarily on negative variances from 
expectations regarding the development of the 
group result after tax or the net debt of the  
Porsche SE Group."
"In the reporting year, no significant non-financial 
risks were identified at the level of Porsche SE’s 
holding operations."
"Opportunities and risks from investments 
 
In connection with any existing and future 
investments, Porsche SE generally faces 
opportunities and risks regarding the effects on its 
result and/or net debt."
"However, there are also corresponding 
opportunities from positive development in these 
areas."
"Porsche SE is currently exposed to 
significant risks from the core investments in 
Volkswagen AG and in Porsche AG and from the 
portfolio investments."
"To detect a possible impairment with regard to 
Porsche SE’s investments at an early stage, the 
company regularly analyzes key figures on the 
business development of the core investments in 
Volkswagen AG and in Porsche AG in particular and, 
if applicable, monitors assessments made by 
analysts."
"The Volkswagen Group continues to 
be exposed to risks from the diesel issue."
"In addition 
to these risks, there are other factors that cannot be 
predicted and whose repercussions are therefore 
difficult to control."
"If they were to occur, they could 
impair the further development of the Volkswagen 
Group and lead to adverse effects at the level of 
Porsche SE."
"Such risks could include natural 
disasters, pandemics, violent conflicts, terrorist 
attacks and interruptions to the energy supply."
"The 
assessment of risks at the level of Volkswagen AG 
is generally based on the report on risks and 
opportunities in the 2023 group management report 
of Volkswagen AG."
"As regards the recoverability of the investment in 
Volkswagen AG, impairment testing was performed 
in the fiscal year 2023 due to the proportionate 
market capitalization being below the carrying 
amount of the investment accounted for at equity."
"As the impairment test is based on the current 
planning of the Volkswagen Group, the risks 
described above of an unexpected development 
which might lead to an impairment in the value of 
the investment also exist here."
"The risk of an 
impairment loss needing to be recognized through 
profit or loss is referred to below as the risk area 
“Impairment Volkswagen”."
"As part of the 
impairment test, sensitivity analyses regarding key 
measurement parameters were performed."
"The 
value in use of the investment in Volkswagen AG 
was higher than the carrying amount in each of the 
scenarios considered in the sensitivity analysis."
"However, based on the volume-weighted average 
stock prices, the market value of the investment in 
Volkswagen AG was most recently below its 
carrying amount."
"As a result, the likelihood of 
occurrence of a potential future impairment loss is 
classified as moderate."
"The methodology for 
assessing the likelihood of occurrence in the risk 
area “Impairment Volkswagen” has been refined 
and now also gives greater consideration to the 
capital market’s view of the core investment in 
Volkswagen AG."
"Such developments 
are currently not expected."
"With regard to the direct investment in Porsche AG, 
there is an increased risk of the result attributable to 
Porsche SE as part of equity accounting falling 
short of expectations on account of the Porsche AG 
Group not developing as planned (risk area “Result 
contribution Porsche AG”)."
"Other 
risks include financial risks and sales risks."
"In 
addition to these risks, there are other factors that 
cannot be predicted and whose repercussions are 
therefore difficult to control."
"If they were to occur, 
they could impair the further development of the 
Porsche AG Group and lead to adverse effects at 
the level of Porsche SE."
"Such risks could include 
natural disasters, pandemics, violent conflicts, 
terrorist attacks and interruptions to the energy 
supply."
"The assessment of risks at the level of 
Porsche AG is generally based on the report on 
risks and opportunities in the 2023 group 
management report of Porsche AG."
"The risks described above of a development below 
plan also exist with regard to the recoverability of 
the investment in Porsche AG (risk area “Impairment 
risk Porsche AG”)."
"Impairment testing was 
performed in the fiscal year 2023 due to the 
proportionate market capitalization being below the 
carrying amount of the investment in Porsche AG 
accounted for at equity as of 31 December 2023."
"As 
part of the impairment test, sensitivity analyses 
regarding key measurement parameters were 
considered."
"The value in use of the investment in 
Porsche AG was higher than the carrying amount in 
each of the scenarios considered in the sensitivity 
analysis."
"Based on the volume-weighted average 
stock price, the market value of the investment in 
Porsche AG was also most recently below its 
carrying amount."
"As a result, the likelihood of 
occurrence of a potential future impairment loss is 
classified as moderate."
"The methodology for 
assessing the likelihood of occurrence in the risk 
area “Impairment Porsche AG” has also been 
refined and now also gives greater consideration to 
the capital market’s view of the core investment in 
Porsche AG."
"Such developments are 
currently not expected."
"Opportunities and risks from the portfolio 
investments of Porsche SE mainly arise from 
changes in market value, which in the case of 
investments measured at fair value have a direct 
and full impact on the result of the Porsche SE 
Group."
"In the case of portfolio investments 
accounted for at equity, in addition to the risk of 
impairment losses, there are also opportunities and 
risks arising from the result of the respective 
investments that is attributable proportionately to 
Porsche SE."
"In particular, the performance of 
technology companies in disruptive markets is in 
general subject to increased uncertainty."
"Risks from financing and financial instruments 
 
In its business activities Porsche SE is exposed to 
risks arising from raising debt capital and the use of 
financial instruments."
"Significant risks resulting from 
such activities are referred to below as the risk area 
“Financing/financial instruments”."
"Risks from financing and investing are regularly 
monitored, reported and, if necessary, managed 
using financial instruments, such as interest rate 
hedging instruments."
"The primary aim is to limit the 
financial risk exposures of the Porsche SE Group."
"The principles and responsibilities for managing the 
risks from the use of financial instruments are 
generally defined by the board of management and 
monitored by the supervisory board."
"Internal 
guidelines exist within the Porsche SE Group that 
clearly define the risk management and control 
processes with regard to the use of financial 
instruments."
"These guidelines regulate, among 
other things, necessary control procedures such as 
the requirement of a hedged item or the segregation 
of functions relating to trades into trading and 
settlement."
"The underlying guidelines and the 
supporting systems are checked regularly and 
brought into line with current market developments."
"Derivatives such as interest rate swaps, are used to 
control interest rate risks from variable-rate 
financing instruments."
"For this purpose, individual 
nominal value tranches of the financing elements 
are always hedged using an interest rate hedging 
instrument with essentially identical valuation-
relevant features."
"The risk of a divergence between 
actual risk and accounting risk position is largely 
mitigated by the use of hedge accounting."
"Other 
financial instruments currently used at Porsche SE 
in particular comprise cash and cash equivalents, 
time deposits and securities."
"The financing may generally result in risks for 
Porsche SE."
"The envisaged repayments of loans 
and the payment of interest will mainly be made 
from dividend inflows from Volkswagen AG and 
Porsche AG."
"If there are significant negative 
divergences from the medium-term planning of the 
dividend receipts, this may give rise to risks relating 
to the repayment of debt financing and from 
associated refinancing needs."
"The bank financing is 
subject to standard market financial covenants 
relating in particular to the market value of Porsche 
SE’s shares in Volkswagen AG and in Porsche AG 
as well as to the interest cover."
"A breach of financial 
covenants can in principle lead to the outstanding 
credit volume falling due and therefore to liquidity 
risks."
"Such developments are not foreseeable at 
present and are considered to be unlikely."
"Furthermore, market price risks can arise from 
changes in market interest rates."
"The use of financial instruments as part of liquidity 
and financial management also gives rise to 
counterparty risks."
"The creditworthiness of the 
counterparties of financial instruments is monitored 
regularly, mainly to assess any potential default."
"To 
mitigate the counterparty risks, Porsche SE also 
diversifies the investment of liquidity and enters into 
interest rate hedges with various counterparties."
"A hold harmless declaration to the deposit 
guarantee fund agency of the Association of 
German Banks is in place for the benefit of 
Volkswagen Bank GmbH, which Porsche SE issued 
in 2009."
"Legal risks 
 
Porsche SE is involved in legal disputes both 
nationally and internationally."
"Where such risks 
are foreseeable, adequate provisions are made in 
order to account for any ensuing risks."
"The amount 
of the provisions for legal risks recognized in the 
reporting year corresponds to the attorneys’ fees 
and litigation expenses anticipated for the 
proceedings."
"The company believes that thus far 
these risks have not had a sustained effect on the 
economic position of the group."
"For the status of the legal proceedings and for 
current developments, reference is made to the 
section “Significant events and developments at the 
Porsche SE Group”."
"Tax opportunities and risks 
 
The contribution of the holding business operations 
of Porsche SE to Volkswagen AG as of 1 August 
2012 is generally associated with tax risks."
"To 
safeguard the transaction from a tax point of view, 
and thus avoid tax back payments for the spin-offs 
performed in the past, rulings were obtained from 
the competent tax authorities."
"Porsche SE 
implemented the necessary measures to execute 
the contribution transaction in accordance with the 
rulings received and is monitoring compliance with 
them."
"In return, 
under certain circumstances Porsche SE holds 
Porsche Holding Stuttgart GmbH, Porsche AG and 
their legal predecessors harmless from tax 
disadvantages that exceed the obligations from 
periods up until and including 31 July 2009 
recognized at the level of these entities."
"If the total 
tax benefits exceed the total tax disadvantages, 
Porsche SE has a claim against Volkswagen AG to 
payment of the amount by which the tax benefits 
exceed the tax disadvantages."
"However, the 
provisions in the contribution agreement do not 
cover all matters and thus not all tax risks of 
Porsche SE from the tax field audits for the 
assessment periods 2006 to 2009."
"The tax field audit Is still being performed for the 
assessment periods 2009 to 2013."
"It therefore 
cannot be ruled out that new findings of the tax field 
audit for the periods 2009 to 2013 as well as legal 
changes may result in an increase or decrease in 
tax provisions and interest or any refunds already 
received might have to be partially paid back."
"Risk assessment for entrepreneurial risks 
 
The methodology for regularly assessing 
entrepreneurial risks remained unchanged in the 
past fiscal year."
"A risk assessment is performed for 
each of the significant entrepreneurial risks of the 
Porsche SE Group using the risk categories “Low”, 
“Moderate” and “High”."
"This involves assessing the 
risk of falling short of the forecast corridor 
communicated for the result after tax and/or the net 
debt of Porsche SE Group."
"The risk assessment of a risk area includes the 
potential impact of the risk area as well as its 
likelihood of occurrence."
"A risk area being analyzed 
is allocated to one of the categories low, moderate 
or high based on its potential impact."
"Considered individually as of the reporting 
date, risk areas categorized as high based on their 
potential impact generally have the potential to 
impact the key performance indicators result after 
tax and/or net debt of the Porsche SE Group by 
more than half of the forecast corridor."
"The likelihood of occurrence is allocated using the 
categories unlikely, moderately likely and highly 
likely."
"Due to the greater 
consideration given to the capital market 
perspective, the likelihood of occurrence of the risk 
area “Impairment Volkswagen” is now assessed as 
moderate (prior year: unlikely)."
"Due to the greater 
consideration given to the capital market 
perspective, the likelihood of occurrence of the risk 
area “Impairment Porsche AG” is now assessed as 
moderate (prior year: unlikely)."
"The risk management 
system aims to ensure that these risks are 
addressed adequately."
"Based on the information 
currently available, the board of management has 
not identified any risks which could endanger the 
ability of the Porsche SE Group to continue as a 
going concern, either individually or in combination 
with other risks."
"Volkswagen AG has implemented its own group-
wide risk management system and is therefore 
responsible for handling its own risks."
"The following 
is based on extracts from the “Report on risks and 
opportunities” in the 2023 group management 
report of Volkswagen AG."
"The aim of the RMS and the ICS 
is to identify potential risks at an early stage so that 
suitable countermeasures can be taken to avert the 
threat of loss to the company, and any risks that 
might jeopardize its continued existence can be 
ruled out."
"Assessing the likelihood of occurrence and extent of 
future events and developments is, by its nature, 
subject to uncertainty."
"The Volkswagen Group is 
therefore aware that even the best RMS cannot 
foresee all potential risks and even the best ICS can 
never completely prevent irregular acts."
"The purpose of structuring the 
RMS/ICS in accordance with the COSO framework 
for enterprise risk management is so that potential 
risk areas are covered in full."
"Uniform group 
principles are used as the basis for managing risks 
in a standardized manner."
"Opportunities are not 
recorded in the RMS processes."
"Another key element of the RMS and ICS at 
Volkswagen is the Three Lines Model, which is 
required by, among other bodies, the European 
Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing 
(“ECIIA”)."
"In line with this model, the Volkswagen 
Group’s RMS and ICS has three lines designed to 
protect the company from significant risks occurring."
"The minimum requirements for the RMS and ICS, 
including the Three Lines Model, are set out at 
Volkswagen in guidelines for the entire group and 
are regularly reviewed and refined."
"In addition, 
Volkswagen offers regular training on the RMS and 
ICS."

every quarter."
"First line:  
Operational risk management and ICS 
 
The first line comprises the operational risk 
management and internal control systems at the 
individual group companies and business units of 
the Volkswagen Group."
"The RMS and ICS are 
integral parts of the Volkswagen Group’s structure 
and workflows."
"Events that may give rise to risk are 
identified and assessed locally in the divisions and 
at the investment companies."
"Countermeasures are 
introduced, the remaining potential impact is 
assessed, and, if necessary, the information 
incorporated into the planning in a timely manner."
"Material risks are reported to the relevant 
committees on an ad hoc basis."
"The results of the 
operational risk management process are 
incorporated into planning and financial control on 
an ongoing basis."
"The targets agreed by 
Volkswagen in the planning rounds are therefore 
continually reviewed in revolving planning updates."
"At the same time, the results of risk mitigation 
measures are promptly incorporated into the 
monthly forecasts regarding further business 
development."
"This means that the board of 
management of Volkswagen AG also has access to 
an overall picture of the current risk situation via the 
documented reporting channels during the year."

"The targets agreed by 
Volkswagen in the planning rounds are therefore

"At the same time, the results of risk mitigation 
measures are promptly incorporated into the 
monthly forecasts regarding further business 
development."
"This means that the board of 
management of Volkswagen AG also has access to 
an overall picture of the current risk situation via the 
documented reporting channels during the year."
"The 
risks are identified and approved in a multiple-party 
verification process and then checked for 
plausibility by Volkswagen’s group risk management 
department."
"A score is calculated for each risk by multiplying the 
likelihood of occurrence (Prob) by the potential 
extent of the damage."
"This enables comparison of 
the risks."
"The extent of the damage is calculated 
from the criteria of financial loss (Mat) and 
reputational damage (Rep) and the potential threat 
to adherence to external legal requirements (Req)."
"A 
score between 0 and 10 is assigned to each of 
these criteria."
"The measures taken to manage and 
control risk are taken into account in the risk 
assessment (net perspective)."
"The score for a likelihood of occurrence of more 
than 50% in the analysis period is classified as high; 
for a medium classification, the likelihood of 
occurrence is at least 25%."
"For the criterion of 
financial loss, the score rises in line with the loss; 
the highest score of 10 is reached when the 
potential loss is upwards of €1 billion."
"The criterion 
of reputational damage can have characteristics 
ranging from local erosion of confidence and loss of 
trust at local level to loss of reputation at regional or 
international level."
"The potential threat to adherence 
to external legal requirements is classified based on 
the potential impact on the local company, the 
brand or the Volkswagen Group."
"In addition to strategic, operational and reporting 
risks, risks arising from potential compliance 
violations (compliance risks) and from sustainability 
issues (ESG) are also integrated into this process."
"Volkswagen Financial Services AG and Volkswagen 
Bank GmbH have implemented their own RMS and 
ICS processes and regularly report to Volkswagen’s 
group risk management department."
"To review the Volkswagen Group’s risk-bearing 
capacity, the Volkswagen Group’s risk management 
uses the risk reports for a regular comparison of the 
aggregated risk situation and risk-bearing capacity."
"A simulation is used to check whether individual 
risks might become a going-concern risk if they are 
aggregated."
"There were no indications of insufficient 
risk-bearing capacity at the Volkswagen Group in 
the fiscal year 2023."

Risk reporting to the committees of Volkswagen AG 
depends on materiality thresholds."
"Risks with a risk 
score of 40 or more or potential financial loss of €1 
billion or more are presented quarterly to the board 
of management of Volkswagen AG and the audit 
committee of the supervisory board of Volkswagen 
AG."
"In addition, the reporting includes all risks from 
the QRP with a risk score of 20."
"In addition, significant changes to the risk situation 
that can arise in the short term, for instance from 
unexpected external events, are reported to the 
board of management of Volkswagen AG as required."
"This is necessary if the risk may lead to potential 
financial loss of €1 billion or more and the likelihood 
of occurrence is estimated at greater than 50%."
"In recent years, Volkswagen has also developed a 
standardized ICS to better protect against process 
risks, which it has put in place in significant 
companies of the Volkswagen Group."
"It continues to 
be introduced at further companies each year."
"The 
ICS thereby goes significantly beyond the 
requirements for the accounting-related ICS."
"In 25 
catalogs of controls, the Volkswagen Group 
companies within its scope are presented with 
requirements in respect of the process risks and 
control objectives to be covered in order to protect 
the value chain in a standardized manner."
"In addition to financial reporting issues, for example, 
they address process risks in development or 
production, as well as in the areas of compliance 
and sustainability."
"The catalogs of controls are 
checked at regular intervals to verify that they are 
up to date and are regularly expanded."
"Key controls to cover process risks and control 
objectives are also tested for their effectiveness; 
any significant weaknesses identified are reported 
to the responsible bodies at Volkswagen AG and 
resolved in the departments."
"Like the QRP
, the 
standardized ICS is supported by the Risk Radar IT 
system."
"Volkswagen regularly optimizes the RMS and ICS as 
part of its continuous monitoring and improvement 
processes."
"In the process, Volkswagen gives equal 
consideration to both internal and external 
requirements."
"As a component of the RMS, the 
Volkswagen Group’s compliance management 
system (“CMS”) is also subject to these control and 
adjustment mechanisms."
"External experts assist in 
the continuous enhancement of the Volkswagen 
Group’s RMS, CMS and ICS on a case-by-case basis."
"Third line:  
Review by Volkswagen Group Internal Audit 
 
Volkswagen Group Internal Audit helps the board of 
management of Volkswagen AG to monitor the 
various divisions and corporate units within the 
Volkswagen Group."
"It regularly checks the risk early 
warning system and the structure and implementation 
of the RMS, ICS and compliance management 
system (CMS) as part of its independent audit 
procedures."
"The audit plan adopted by the board of 
management of Volkswagen AG includes the first and 
second lines, i.e., the risk-mitigating functions in 
addition to the operational units."
"Risk early warning system at Volkswagen 
The requirements for a risk early warning system are 
met by means of the RMS and ICS elements 
described above (first and second line)."
"The 
Volkswagen Group’s risk situation is ascertained, 
assessed and documented and therefore also 
complies with legal requirements."
"The plausibility and adequacy of 
the risk reports are examined via spot checks in 
detailed interviews with the divisions and 
companies concerned."
"In addition, scheduled examinations as part of the 
audit of the annual financial statements are 
conducted at companies in the Volkswagen Group’s 
financial services division."
"As part of the scheduled 
supervisory process and unscheduled audits, the 
competent supervisory authority assesses whether 
the requirements, strategies, processes and 
mechanisms ensure solid risk management and solid 
risk cover."
"Furthermore, the Prüfungsverband 
deutscher Banken (Auditing Association of German 
Banks) audits Volkswagen Bank GmbH from time to 
time."
"Volkswagen Financial Services AG operates a risk 
early warning and management system."
"Its aim is to 
ensure that the locally applicable regulatory 
requirements are adhered to and at the same time 
to enable appropriate and effective risk 
management at group level."
"Important components 
of it are regularly reviewed as part of the audit of the 
annual financial statements."
"The 
Volkswagen AG board of management has received 
no information to indicate that the Volkswagen 
Group’s RMS or ICS as a whole were inadequate or 
ineffective in the fiscal year 2023."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limits to the 
effectiveness of any risk management, compliance 
management and control system."
"Even a system 
judged to be adequate and effective cannot, for 
example, ensure that all actually materializing risks 
will be identified in advance or that any process 
disruptions will be ruled out under all circumstances."
"These measures are designed to 
minimize the risk of material misstatement in the 
accounts and in external reporting."
"Main features of the risk management and 
integrated internal control system in the context 
of the financial reporting process 
 
The Volkswagen Group’s accounting is essentially 
organized along decentralized lines."
"For the most 
part, accounting duties are performed by the 
consolidated companies themselves or entrusted to 
the Volkswagen Group’s shared service centers."
"In 
principle, the financial statements of Volkswagen 
AG and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with 
the IFRSs and the Volkswagen IFRS Accounting 
Manual are transmitted to the Volkswagen Group in 
encrypted form."
"A standard market product is used 
for encryption."
"The aim of the Volkswagen IFRS Accounting Manual, 
which has been prepared taking into consideration 
external expert opinions, is to ensure the 
application and assessment of uniform accounting 
policies based on the requirements applicable to 
the parent company of the Volkswagen Group."
"In 
particular, it includes more detailed guidance on the 
application of legal requirements and industry-
specific issues."
"These 
discussions address both the plausibility of the 
single-entity financial statements and specific 
significant issues at the subsidiaries."
"The effectiveness of the Volkswagen Group’s 
internal control system in the context of the 
accounting process is systematically assessed in 
significant companies of the Volkswagen Group as 
part of the standardized ICS."
"This begins with a risk 
analysis and definition of controls with the aim of 
identifying significant risks for the financial reporting 
process."
"Regular tests based on samples are 
performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
controls."
"These form the basis for a self-evaluation 
of whether the controls are appropriately designed 
and effective."
"The combined group management report of the 
Volkswagen Group and Volkswagen AG is prepared 
– in accordance with the applicable requirements 
and regulations – centrally but with the involvement 
of and in consultation with the Volkswagen Group 
units and companies."
"In addition, the accounting-related internal control 
system is independently reviewed by Volkswagen 
Group Internal Audit in Germany and abroad."
"Integrated consolidation and planning system 
 
The Volkswagen consolidation and corporate 
management system (“VoKUs”) enables the 
Volkswagen Group to consolidate and analyze both 
Financial Reporting’s backward-looking data and 
Controlling’s forward-looking data."
"To 
verify data consistency, VoKUs has a multi-level 
validation system that primarily checks content 
plausibility between the balance sheet, the income 
statement and the notes."
"The opportunities and risks presented 
also include in particular those from the Porsche AG 
Group."
"In order to provide a better overview, the 
risks and opportunities have been grouped into 
categories."
"For each risk category of the 
Volkswagen Group, the most significant risks are 
stated in order of their importance as identified by 
Volkswagen using the risk score from the QRP
."
"The assessment of the Volkswagen Group’s risk 
categories and the reports to the Volkswagen AG 
board of management include amongst other items 
all risks reported to the Volkswagen Group Risk 
Management department with a risk score of 20 or 
more for the units included from the QRP
."
"The risk 
categories are plotted based on the average scores."
"In the reporting year, no risks with such scores were 
reported at Volkswagen for the “Risks from mergers 
& acquisitions and/or other strategic 
partnerships/investments” risk category."
"Where they can be assessed, 
risks and opportunities that Volkswagen expects to 
occur are already reflected in its medium-term 
planning and its forecast."
"For 
this risk category, Volkswagen classifies the 
likelihood of occurrence as high (prior year: high) 
and the potential extent of damage is classified as 
medium (prior year: medium)."
"From the Volkswagen 
Group’s perspective, the most significant risks from 
the QRP in this category arise from a negative 
influence on markets and unit sales driven among 
other factors by restrictions on trade and 
increasingly protectionist tendencies."
"The category “Research and development risks” 
contains risks arising from research and 
development as well as risks and opportunities from 
the modular toolkit strategy."
"For this risk category, 
Volkswagen classifies the likelihood of occurrence 
as high (prior year: high) and the potential extent of 
damage is classified as medium (prior year: 
medium)."
"The most significant risks from the QRP 
result from the inability to develop products in line 
with demand and requirements, especially with 
regard to e-mobility and digitalization."
"As a consequence, bottlenecks or even 
outages in production may occur at Volkswagen, 
thus preventing the planned production volumes 
from being achieved."
"For this risk category, 
Volkswagen classifies the likelihood of occurrence 
as medium (prior year: high) and the potential extent 
of damage is classified as medium (prior year: 
medium)."
"The most significant risks from the QRP 
lie particularly in cybersecurity and new regulatory 
requirements regarding IT, as well as in volatile 
procurement markets, here primarily in relation to 
the supply of parts, and in quality problems."
"The risk category “Environmental and social risks” 
include personnel risks as well as risks from 
environmental protection regulations."
"For this risk 
category, Volkswagen classifies the likelihood of 
occurrence as high (prior year: medium) and the 
potential extent of damage is classified as medium 
(prior year: high)."
"The most significant risks from the 
QRP arise from non-fulfillment of CO2-related 
requirements."
"Risks from litigation and legal risks in connection 
with the diesel issue as well as tax risks are

subsumed under “Legal risks”."
"For this risk category, 
Volkswagen classifies the likelihood of occurrence 
as low (prior year: medium) and the potential extent 
of damage is classified as high (prior year: high)."
"The most significant risks from the QRP are 
associated with the diesel issue."
"For this risk category, 
Volkswagen classifies the likelihood of occurrence 
as high and the potential extent of damage is 
classified as medium."
"No risks with a score of 20 or 
more were reported by Volkswagen for this risk 
category in the prior year."
"The most significant risks 
from the QRP arise in particular from volatile foreign 
exchange markets."
"No risks with a score of 20 or 
more were reported by Volkswagen for this risk 
category in the reporting year."
"Should these legal or estimation risks 
materialize, this could result in further substantial 
financial charges."
"In particular, adjustment of the 
provisions recognized by Volkswagen in light of 
knowledge acquired or events occurring in the 
future cannot be ruled out."
"For further information 
on the legal risks in connection with the diesel 
issue, please refer to note [2] of the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal 
year 2023."
"In line with IAS 37.92, no further statements have 
been made by Volkswagen concerning estimates of 
financial impact or regarding uncertainty as to the 
amount or maturity of provisions and contingent 
liabilities in relation to the diesel issue."
"This is so as 
to not compromise the results of the proceedings or 
the interests of Volkswagen."
"Volkswagen 
has established a comprehensive risk management 
system to ensure that these risks are controlled."
"The Volkswagen Group continues to be exposed to 
risks from the diesel issue."
"In 2024, an adverse 
effect may result from the continued limited 
availability of parts, energy and other raw materials, 
as well as from geopolitical tensions and conflicts, 
including from the Russia-Ukraine war and the 
confrontations in the Middle East."
"Taking into 
account all the information known to the Volkswagen 
Group at the time of preparing its management 
report, no risks exist which could pose a threat to 
the continued existence of significant Volkswagen 
Group companies or the Volkswagen Group."
"The 
persistently high inflation in major economic regions 
and the resulting restrictive monetary policy 
measures taken by central banks are expected to 
continue to dampen consumer demand."
"Risks 
continue to be seen in protectionist tendencies, 
turbulence in the financial markets and structural 
deficits in individual countries."
"In addition, 
continuing geopolitical tensions and conflicts are 
weighing on growth prospects; risks are associated 
in particular with the Russia-Ukraine war and the 
confrontations in the Middle East."
"It is assumed that 
both the advanced economies and emerging 
markets will show positive momentum on average, 
albeit with below-average growth in gross domestic 
product."
"For 2024, it is expected for the euro to appreciate 
slightly against the US dollar and to remain at a 
similar level against sterling as in the reporting year."
"It is assumed that the Chinese renminbi, Brazilian 
real, Mexican peso, South African rand and Turkish 
lira will depreciate to varying degrees."
"Due to the 
difficult economic situation in Argentina and the 
uncertainty following the presidential election, the 
Argentinian peso is expected to depreciate sharply."
"Whether there will be further changes in key interest 
rates in 2024 in the respective countries will depend 
firstly on the development of inflation and secondly 
on the scale of a possible economic downturn."
"Overall, a relatively slight increase in interest rates is 
expected on average in 2024 compared to 2023."
"Market developments 2024 
with regard to the core investments 
Commodity price trends 
 
For 2024, Volkswagen expects prices for some 
commodities to continue to fall due to the 
technological transformation and as a result of 
surplus supplies."
"For the majority of commodities, 
however, Volkswagen expects prices to rise given 
the anticipated recovery in the global economy."
"Trends in the markets for passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles 
 
The trend in the automotive industry closely follows 
global economic developments."
"Volkswagen 
assumes that competition in the international 
automotive markets will intensify further."
"Crisis-
related disruption to the global supply chain and the 
resulting impact on vehicle availability may weigh on 
the volume of new registrations."
"Uncertainty may 
also arise from continued shortages of

intermediates and commodities."
"These may be 
further exacerbated by the consequences of the 
Russia-Ukraine war and the confrontations in the 
Middle East and may, in particular, lead to rising 
prices for materials and a declining availability of 
energy."
"The Volkswagen Group predicts that trends in the 
markets for passenger cars in the individual regions 
will be mixed but predominantly positive in 2024."
"Overall, the global volume of new car sales is 
expected to be slightly higher than in the prior year."
"Trends in the markets for light commercial vehicles 
in the individual regions will be mixed; on the whole, 
Volkswagen expects the sales volume for 2024 to 
be slightly above the prior-year figure."
"A noticeable year-on-year increase in demand is 
anticipated for 2024 in the bus markets relevant for 
the Volkswagen Group, whereby this will vary 
depending on the region."
"Trends in the markets for power engineering 
 
For 2024, the market environment in the power 
engineering business area is generally expected to 
remain challenging."
"The current geopolitical 
situation and the development of energy and 
commodity prices will continue to generate 
uncertainty in virtually all markets."
"Trends in the markets for financial services 
 
Volkswagen anticipates that automotive financial 
services will prove highly important to global vehicle 
sales in 2024."
"The continuing shortages of 
intermediates and commodities may generate 
uncertainty, exacerbated by the consequences of 
the Russia-Ukraine war and the confrontations in 
the Middle East."
"Furthermore, the increased interest 
rates could put pressure on the demand for financial 
services."
"The Volkswagen Group expects demand 
to rise in emerging markets where market 
penetration has so far been low."
"Regions with 
already established automotive financial services 
markets will probably see a continuation of the 
trend towards achieving mobility at the lowest 
possible total cost."
"The shift from financing to lease 
contracts that has begun in the European financial 
services business with individual customers will 
continue."
"Integrated end-to-end solutions, which 
include mobility-related service modules such as 
insurance and innovative packages of services, are

likely to become increasingly important."
"Additionally, 
Volkswagen expects that demand will increase for 
new forms of mobility, such as rental and car 
subscription services, and for integrated mobility 
services, for example parking, refueling and 
charging."
"Volkswagen anticipates an increase in the 
importance of direct business between 
manufacturers and customers."
"The seamless 
integration of financial services into the online 
vehicle offering will become increasingly important 
in the promotion of this type of business."
"In the mid-sized and heavy commercial vehicles 
category, Volkswagen anticipates rising demand for 
financial services products in emerging markets."
"In 
these countries in particular, financing solutions 
support vehicle sales and are thus an essential 
component of the sales process."
"In the developed 
markets, Volkswagen expects to see increased 
demand for telematics services and services aimed 
at reducing total cost of ownership in 2024."
"Market developments 2024 with regard to 
the portfolio investments 
Trends in the markets for M&A and venture 
capital 
 
The activity of the global markets for M&A and 
venture capital is closely linked to macroeconomic 
and geopolitical factors."
"Due to the more stable 
investment environment compared to prior years 
and the reduced uncertainty with regard to interest 
rates and inflation expectations, Porsche SE 
expects M&A activity to increase in the course of 
2024 compared to the prior year."
"Although the IPO 
market remains difficult as an exit option for private 
equity investors, Porsche SE expects the level of 
M&A activity in 2024 to recover from the sharp 
decline in 2022 and 2023."
"This is also due to the 
fact that the lower level of M&A activity over the 
past two years has led to a backlog of transactions 
of private equity portfolio companies, which is 
expected to gradually dissipate."
"Due to the higher level of interest rates compared to 
prior years, Porsche SE expects the financing 
environment on the global market for venture capital 
to remain cautious, although the decline in valuation 
levels may present opportunities for investments."

Anticipated development  
of the Volkswagen Group 
Volkswagen’s planning is based on the assumption 
that global economic output will grow overall in 
2024 compared with 2023, albeit at a slower pace."
"The persistently high inflation in major economic 
regions and the resulting restrictive monetary policy 
measures taken by central banks are expected to 
increasingly dampen consumer demand."
"Volkswagen continues to believe that risks will arise 
from protectionist tendencies, turbulence in the 
financial markets and structural deficits in individual 
countries."
"In addition, continuing geopolitical 
tensions and conflicts are weighing on growth 
prospects; risks are associated in particular with the 
Russia-Ukraine war and the confrontations in the 
Middle East."
"The Volkswagen Group assumes that 
both the advanced economies and the emerging 
markets will show positive momentum on average, 
albeit with below-average growth in gross domestic 
product."
"In a challenging market environment, the 
Volkswagen Group anticipates that deliveries to 
customers in 2024 will increase by up to 3% 
compared to the prior year."
"Challenges will arise in particular from the economic 
situation, the increasing intensity of competition, 
volatile commodity, energy and foreign exchange 
markets, and more stringent emissions-related 
requirements."
"Volkswagen expects the revenue of the group and 
the passenger cars business area to exceed the 
prior-year figure by up to 5% in 2024."
"The operating 
return on sales for the Volkswagen Group and the 
passenger cars business area is likely to be 
between 7% and 7.5%."
"For the commercial vehicles 
business area, Volkswagen anticipates an operating 
return on sales of 8.5% to 9.5%, also amid a year-
on-year increase of up to 5% in revenue."
"In the 
power engineering business area, Volkswagen 
expects revenue to be up to 2% above the  
prior-year figure and the operating result to be in the 
low three-digit million-euro range."
"For the financial 
services division, Volkswagen forecasts an increase 
of 3% to 7% in revenue compared with the prior 
year and an operating result in the range of  
€4.0 billion."
"The Porsche AG Group’s planning for 2024 
assumes that average global economic output will 
continue to grow, albeit at a lower level compared 
to the reporting year."
"This is provided that 
geopolitical conflicts and tensions with global 
repercussions do not intensify any further."
"Furthermore, risks can be seen in protectionist 
tendencies, turbulence in financial markets, 
structural deficits in some countries, the real 
economic impact of high inflation rates and interest 
rates around the world."
"Furthermore, the forecast 
for 2024 assumes difficulties and continued high 
prices for intermediates and raw materials, including 
energy."
"For 2024 as a whole, based on the aforementioned 
assumptions, the Porsche AG Group expects the 
operating return on sales to be between 15% and 
17%."
"This forecast is based on assumed revenue in 
a range of €40 billion to €42 billion."
"The forecast result after tax of the Porsche SE 
Group is therefore largely based on the Volkswagen 
Group’s expectations regarding its future 
development."
"While the result after tax of the 
Volkswagen Group is included in the forecast of the 
Porsche SE Group, the forecast of the Volkswagen 
Group is based only on its operating result."
"As a 
result, effects outside of the operating result at the 
level of the Volkswagen Group do not affect its 
forecast, although they do have a proportionate 
effect on the amount of the Porsche SE Group’s 
forecast result after tax."
"The expectations of the Volkswagen Group 
regarding future development were therefore 
expanded on by the board of management of 
Porsche SE."
"This also includes the expectations of 
the board of management of Porsche SE regarding 
the profit contributions from investments that are 
contained in the financial result of the Volkswagen 
Group."
"The result of the Porsche SE Group is also affected 
by the result from investments accounted for at 
equity with regard to Porsche AG that is attributable 
to Porsche SE and therefore on the earnings 
situation of the Porsche AG Group."
"The earnings 
forecast of Porsche SE therefore also takes into 
account the expectations of the Porsche AG Group 
regarding its future development."
"As a result of this, the actual business development 
may deviate, both positively and negatively, from 
the expectations."
"Risks that could lead to deviations 
largely relate to protectionist tendencies, turbulence 
in the financial markets and structural deficits in 
individual countries."
"In addition, continuing 
geopolitical tensions and conflicts are weighing on 
growth prospects."
"The following aspects are also taken into account in 
the forecast: For the fiscal year 2024, Porsche SE 
expects expenses for holding operations in the core 
investments segment to be generally comparable to 
those in the reporting year, with a slight decline in 
finance costs."
"In addition, a slightly negative 
investment result on a par with the reporting year is 
expected for the portfolio investments segment – 
excluding changes in market value – which will 
essentially correspond to the segment result after 
tax."
"With regard to the financial position, Porsche SE 
expects total dividend income of €1.7 billion and 
total dividend distributions to its shareholders of 
€783 million in the fiscal year 2024."
"Investments in 
portfolio companies in the low three-digit million-
euro range are also planned."
"In particular on the basis of the expectations of the 
Volkswagen Group and the Porsche AG Group 
regarding their future development, Porsche SE 
expects a group result after tax of between  
€3.8 billion and €5.8 billion for the fiscal year 2024."
"The same applies for the result after tax for the core 
investments segment."
"As of 31 December 2023, the Porsche SE Group 
has net debt of €5.7 billion."
"As of 31 December 
2024, net debt of between €5.0 billion and  
€5.5 billion is expected for the Porsche SE Group."

The board of management and supervisory board  
of Porsche Automobil Holding SE declare in 
accordance with Sec."
"161 (1) AktG that, since the 
most recent declaration on conformity in 
December 2022, the company has complied with,  
1 In the following, the term “group” refers to a group as defined in the IFRS."
"As 
there is no maximum age limit for members of the 
board of management, this recommendation has 
not been and will not be complied with."
"The 
supervisory board appoints members of the board 
of management based exclusively on their 
qualifications and their ability to conduct the 
company’s business in the company’s best interest."
"The suitability of the members of the board of 
management in this regard does not depend on 
their age."
"An age limit would also impose a general 
limitation on the selection of qualified candidates 
and may appear discriminatory."
"Recommendation C.2 GCGC:  
C.2 GCGC recommends that an age limit be 
specified for members of the supervisory board and 
disclosed in the declaration of compliance."
"This 
recommendation has not been and will not be 
complied with."
"The supervisory board is still of the 
opinion that the ability of a supervisory board 
member to monitor and advise the board of 
management in its management of the company 
does not cease upon having reached a certain age."
A fixed age limit may also appear discriminatory.
"As regards this recommendation, a 
deviation has been and is declared as a 
precautionary measure."
"The requirements of the 
Code are not specific and their limits and scope are 
unclear."
"Recommendation G.1, 1st indent GCGC:  
G.1, 1st indent GCGC recommends that the 
remuneration system define how the target total 
remuneration is determined for each member of the 
board of management and stipulate the amount that 
the total remuneration must not exceed (maximum 
remuneration)."
"Some interpret this recommendation 
to mean that the supervisory board is to individually 
set the maximum remuneration for each member of 
the board of management in the remuneration 
system."
"In compliance with the provisions of the 
AktG, the supervisory board of Porsche Automobil 
Holding SE has determined a collective maximum 
remuneration for the full board of management."
"As 
before, the board of management service 
agreements will not necessarily provide for a 
contractually agreed maximum remuneration in the 
future either."
"The background to this is that, during 
the standard four-year term of validity of the 
remuneration system, it should be possible to decide 
on the individual maximum remuneration on a case-
by-case basis within the framework of the defined 
maximum remuneration for the full board of 
management."
"As a precautionary measure, it is 
therefore declared that the recommendation of G.1, 
1st indent GCGC has not been and will not fully be 
complied with in that no maximum remuneration has 
been individually defined in the remuneration system 
for each member of the board of management."
"Therefore, 
the recommendation in G.10 sentence 1 GCGC has 
not been and will not be complied with."
"Recommendation G.10 sentence 2 GCGC:  
G.10 sentence 2 GCGC recommends that awarded 
long-term variable remuneration components be 
accessible to board of management members only 
after a period of four years."
"The board of 
management remuneration system and the board of 
management service agreements of the current 
members of the board of management (insofar as 
they provide for variable remuneration) continue to 
provide for a two-year retention period after the 
bonus-relevant fiscal year."
"In deviation from G.10 
sentence 2 GCGC, this means, in principle, that at 
the time of disbursement the long-term incentive 
component is accessible after a period of three 
years."
"Therefore, the recommendation in G.10 sentence 2 
GCGC has not been and will not be complied with."
"Thus, the targets originally agreed for  
Mr. von Hagen were not and will not be applied 
unchanged to the outstanding variable remuneration 
for the period until termination of his contract."
"It is 
therefore declared that regarding the outstanding 
variable remuneration payments for Mr. von Hagen 
for the years 2018 to 2021 the recommendation in  
G.12 GCGC has not been and will not be complied 
with in the future."
"In this 
case, the recommendation in G.13 sentence 1 GCGC 
would not be complied with due to the exit agreement 
entered into with Mr. von Hagen."
"As a precautionary 
measure, it is therefore declared that, in connection 
with the exit agreement entered into with Mr. von 
Hagen, the recommendation in G.13 sentence 1 
GCGC has not been and will not be complied with in 
the future."
"Composition of the board of management 
The board of management of Porsche SE 
comprises at least two persons."
"The supervisory 
board may specify a larger number of members of 
the board of management."
"In addition to his position on the board of 
management at Porsche SE, Mr. Pötsch also acts as 
chairman of the supervisory board of Volkswagen AG 
and member of the supervisory board of Porsche AG."
"Dr. Döss is also a member of the board of 
management of Volkswagen AG, where he is 
responsible for integrity and legal affairs; he also acts 
as chairman of the supervisory board of AUDI AG."
"Mr. Meschke also acts as deputy chairman of the 
board of management and member of the board of 
management responsible for finance and IT of 
Porsche AG."
"In order to meet these requirements, the 
supervisory board has resolved to introduce, among 
other things, a diversity concept aimed at 
diversifying the board of management."
"Regardless of this, the best interest of the 
company always comes first when filling a specific 
position on the board of management, taking into 
account the circumstances of the individual case."
"The supervisory board is therefore guided in its 
decision mainly by the professional knowledge and 
personal suitability of the candidates."
"There should be no 
specific requirements regarding the age of 
individual or all board of management members 
so as not to unduly restrict the ability of the 
supervisory board and executive committee to 
select suitable candidates for the board of 
management."
"In particular, there is no maximum 
age limit or term of office for the members of the 
board of management."
"· 
In accordance with Sec."
"111 (5) AktG, the 
supervisory board last resolved in 2022 to set a 
target of 25% for female representation on the 
board of management by 31 May 2027."
"No target 
deviating from this percentage was set for the 
board of management’s diversity concept."
"The 
gender-specific requirements for the composition 
of the board of management introduced by the 
FüPoG II [“Zweites Führungspositionen-Gesetz”: 
Second Act on Equal Participation of Men and 
Women in Management Positions] do not apply to 
Porsche SE."
"· 
The members of the board of management should 
complement each other in terms of their 
educational and professional background and 
cover as broad a range of knowledge and 
experience as possible."
"In this context, 
particularly the role of the company as an 
investment management holding company and 
the company’s respective investment portfolio 
must be given due consideration."
"· 
The composition of the board of management 
should reflect an appropriate degree of 
international diversity in consideration of the fact 
that the company holds foreign investments as 
well as German investments with international 
operations."
"In light of this, at least one board of 
management member should have international 
experience obtained, in particular, from a 
professional activity or training abroad or resulting 
from the candidate’s origin."
"The diversity concept is implemented by the 
supervisory board, which takes into account the 
above-mentioned diversity criteria and their 
objectives when appointing board of management 
members."
"The requirements of the diversity concept for the 
board of management have been met, with the 
exception of the target for female representation, 
which has an implementation deadline of 31 May 
2027."
"76 (4) AktG requires that the board of 
management specify targets for the percentage of 
women at the two management levels below the 
board of management and set a deadline for 
achieving these targets."
"By resolution of 22 June 
2022, the board of management decided to again 
set the targets for female representation at the two 
management levels below the board of 
management at 25% each, setting 31 May 2027 as 
the implementation deadline."
"Female representation 
at the first management level is currently 33% and 
at the second management level 25%."
"The executive committee 
responsible for board of management matters once 
again addressed this topic in depth in the fiscal year 
2023."
"The executive committee and the board of 
management also discuss this topic regularly."
"If a 
board of management position needs to be filled, 
suitable candidates are identified in a structured 
process, considering candidates from both within 
and outside of the company."
"Some of the current 
board of management functions may also be 
combined following a change in the board of 
management."
"Working methods of the board of  
management 
The board of management has sole responsibility 
for the management of the company and the 
Porsche SE Group in the interest of the company 
and represents the company in transactions with 
third parties."
"Its main duties pertain to setting the 
strategic focus and management of Porsche SE as 
well as the establishment and monitoring of an 
appropriate and effective internal control and risk 
management system."
"The duties and 
responsibilities of the board of management are 
specified in more detail in the rules of procedure 
issued by the supervisory board."
"For example, Mr. Pötsch and  
Dr. Döss were not involved in the resolution on the 
voting behavior of Porsche SE at the annual general 
meeting of Volkswagen AG."
"Likewise, Mr. Pötsch 
and Mr. Meschke were not involved in the resolution 
on the voting behavior of Porsche SE at the annual 
general meeting of Porsche AG."
"The members of the board of management are 
jointly responsible for all aspects of the 
management of the company."
"The full board of 
management decides on all matters of material or 
fundamental importance."
"This overall responsibility 
notwithstanding, each member of the board of 
management independently manages the business 
area assigned to him as far as the decision is not 
– in matters of material or fundamental importance – 
the responsibility of the full board of management."
"The chairman of the 
board of management is responsible for organizing 
and coordinating cooperation with the supervisory 
board and its members; he is responsible for 
ensuring that the supervisory board is informed in a 
timely, conscientious and comprehensive manner."
"In 
addition, he is responsible for ensuring that Porsche 
SE continues to thrive by having constant personal 
contact and dialog with the chairman of the 
supervisory board."

"Instruments of corporate governance 
In the context of responsible corporate governance 
at Porsche SE, compliance with the relevant legal 
requirements has the highest priority."
"Porsche SE 
follows the recommendations of the GCGC as 
regards both the individual entity and the group in 
the scope set out in the declaration on the GCGC 
and in potential updates."
"Furthermore, the board of 
management of Porsche SE has put in place 
internal guidelines to ensure compliance with the 
legal requirements, as Porsche SE’s reputation is 
affected by the actions and behavior of everyone at 
the company."
"The managers of Porsche SE are largely responsible 
for ensuring that the guidelines and rules within the 
company are strictly observed and complied with."
"In 
day-to-day business, every manager must seek to 
ensure that employees have the greatest possible 
freedom of action, without neglecting the 
fundamental principles of good corporate 
governance."
"To ensure this is the case, Porsche SE 
regularly provides its managers and employees with 
training that focuses on the content of its internal 
guidelines."
"The managers of Porsche SE ensure that the 
corporate governance practices set out above are 
complied with at its fully consolidated subsidiaries to 
the extent they are applicable there."
"The financial statements of Porsche SE as the 
parent company of the Porsche SE Group are 
based on the accounting provisions of the German 
Commercial Code and the special accounting 
provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act."
"The auditor for the fiscal year 2023 and for the 
review of the half-yearly financial report 2023 is 
Grant Thornton AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, 
Düsseldorf, as an independent auditor."
"In addition, 
the facts underlying the declaration on conformity in 
accordance with Sec."
"161 (1) AktG are taken into 
consideration during the annual audit."
"The chairman 
of the audit committee is informed of any factual 
findings made by the auditor that indicate that the 
declaration on conformity is inaccurate."
"The auditor 
is also required to note such inaccuracies in the 
audit report."
"Compliance 
 
In accordance with the provisions of the GCGC, the 
board of management ensures compliance with 
legal provisions and internal policies, and works 
toward ensuring compliance."
"Porsche SE has a 
board of management function dedicated to legal 
affairs and compliance."

member of the board of management responsible 
for legal affairs and compliance is to report to the 
full board of management on all issues relating to 
compliance, to introduce preventive measures, 
manage and monitor these and work towards 
compliance with regulations."
"Compliance activities 
are based on a preventive strategy."
"Porsche SE has set up a compliance council that 
regularly addresses the company’s compliance."
"It 
supports the board of management member 
responsible for legal affairs and compliance in 
performing his duties, in particular in monitoring 
compliance with the legal provisions applicable to 
the company and its employees as well as 
preventing potential infringements."
"Porsche SE has given employees and third parties 
the opportunity to report suspected breaches of the 
law within the company via various channels."
"Any 
reports received are treated with the utmost 
confidentiality."
"The protection of whistleblowers is a 
top priority for the company."
"An internal company policy of Porsche SE specifies 
the organizational units and decision makers 
responsible for procedures relating to compliance."
"Compliance and integrity at Porsche SE are also 
ensured by a code of conduct that is binding for all 
employees and the board of management of 
Porsche SE."
"This code of conduct is specified and 
supplemented by internal company policies on 
compliance and other selected topics, as amended 
from time to time."
"Risk management system and internal control 
system 
 
The Porsche SE Group has a Porsche SE group-
wide risk management and internal control system 
in place that helps the management identify major 
risks at an early stage, thus enabling them to initiate 
countermeasures in good time."
"The risk 
management and internal control system is 
structured at the due discretion of the board of 
management and, in accordance with Sec."
"91 (3) 
AktG, takes into account the scope of the business 
activities and risk situation of the company."
"The risk 
management and internal control system at the 
Porsche SE Group is continuously tested for 
effectiveness and continually optimized to reflect 
any changed conditions."
"Further details on the risk management and internal 
control system are explained in the “Opportunities 
and risks of future development” section of the 
annual report."
"Communication und transparency 
 
Porsche SE attaches great importance to 
transparent communication and regularly keeps 
shareholders, financial analysts, shareholder 
associations, the media and the general public 
informed about the situation of the company and its 
business development."

provides information in the form of ad hoc 
announcements about insider information directly 
affecting Porsche SE in accordance with Art."
"17 of 
the European Market Abuse Directive."
"These ad hoc 
announcements are also published on the 
homepage of Porsche SE."
"Environmental, employee and social matters as 
well as respect for human rights 
 
Porsche SE attaches great importance to 
environmental, employee and social matters as well 
as respect for human rights."
"This is also reflected in 
several of Porsche SE’s investments that have 
sustainability aspects enshrined in their business 
models."
"Porsche SE expects the importance of 
sustainability aspects in the business models of 
Porsche SE’s investments to increase even further."
"In this context, the topic of Environmental, Social, 
Governance (“ESG”), which describes the basic 
principles of sustainable management, also plays a 
key role for Porsche SE."
"The board of management 
and supervisory board expressly acknowledge the 
particular importance of ESG-related topics for the 
business activity of Porsche SE."

"Monitoring and advice also include sustainability 
issues."
"The supervisory board has to ensure that its 
members collectively have the knowledge, skills, 
and professional expertise required to properly 
perform these duties."
"For this purpose, the 
composition of the supervisory board reflects in 
particular the activities of the company as a capital-
market-oriented investment holding company with 
international operations in the area of mobility 
solutions as well as the ownership structure of the 
company."
"The full supervisory board should have skills that 
are of material importance for the activities of the 
company as a capital-market-oriented investment 
holding company with international operations in 
the areas of mobility solutions."
"Furthermore, one of these members of the 
supervisory board or another member of the 
supervisory board must have both specific 
knowledge and experience in applying accounting 
principles and using internal control and risk 
management systems and be familiar with statutory 
audits."
"The members of the full supervisory board 
must be familiar with the sectors in which the 
company operates."
"In accordance with recommendation C.1 sentence 5 
GCGC, the status of the implementation of the

board is familiar with the field of activity of the 
company as a capital-market-oriented investment 
holding company with international operations in the 
area of mobility solutions and has competencies that 
are of material importance for the activities of the

Pursuant to recommendation C.11 of the GCGC, 
no more than two former members of the board of 
management should belong to the supervisory 
board."
"· 
Pursuant to recommendation C.12 of the GCGC, 
members of the supervisory board should not be 
members of governing bodies of, or exercise 
advisory functions at, significant competitors of 
the company and should not have any personal 
relationships with a significant competitor."
"· 
In accordance with Sec."
"111 (5) AktG, the 
supervisory board in 2022 set a target of 10% for 
female representation on the supervisory board 
by 31 May 2027."
"For the supervisory board’s 
diversity concept, no target deviating from this 
percentage is to be set."
"Since the annual general 
meeting appointed Ms."

supervisory board has had two female members, 
giving a female representation of 20%, thus 
exceeding the target set for female representation

The supervisory board should exclusively 
comprise individuals who are able to devote the 
amount of time necessary to properly fulfill their 
duties as supervisory board members."
"· 
In terms of its composition, the supervisory board 
should ensure an appropriate age structure."
"There 
is no age limit for members of the supervisory 
board or a maximum term of office to be served 
on the supervisory board."
"The supervisory board 
is still of the opinion that the ability to monitor and 
advise the board of management in its 
management of the company does not cease 
upon having reached a certain age or upon having 
served a certain term of office."
"A fixed age limit 
may also appear discriminatory."
"· 
The members of the supervisory board should 
complement each other in terms of their 
educational and professional background and 
cover as broad a range of knowledge and 
experience as possible."
"In this context, 
particularly the role of the company as an 
investment management holding company and 
the company’s respective investment portfolio 
must be given due consideration."

The composition of the supervisory board should 
reflect an appropriate degree of international 
diversity considering the fact that the company 
holds foreign investments as well as German 
investments with international operations."
"In light 
of this, at least three supervisory board members 
should have international experience obtained 
either from a professional activity or training 
abroad or resulting from the member’s origin."
"Unless indicated otherwise, the above-mentioned 
targets relate to the full supervisory board."
"The 
supervisory board may only submit proposals for 
the election of a supervisory board member to the 
annual general meeting."
"Supervisory board 
members are generally elected by the annual 
general meeting."
"When making recommendations to the supervisory 
board, the nominations committee should therefore 
appropriately take into account the criteria set out in 
the profile of requirements when searching for and 
selecting suitable candidates."

"Working methods of the supervisory 
board 
The members of the supervisory board jointly fulfill 
the supervisory board’s statutory duties and those 
imposed by the articles of association."
"The duties of 
the supervisory board include, in particular, 
monitoring and advising the management."
"In 
addition to this, certain types of transaction of the 
board of management require the prior approval of 
the supervisory board."
"Material transactions with 
related parties pursuant to Sec."
"111b (1) AktG also 
require the approval of the supervisory board."
"The supervisory board is subject to the rules of 
procedure that can be found on the Porsche SE 
homepage at  
 
http://www.porsche-se.com/en/company/ 
corporate-governance/ 
The supervisory board cooperates closely with the 
other company bodies for the good of the company."
"Its members have the same rights and duties; they 
are not bound by orders or instructions, especially 
not those of the shareholders."
"The chairman of the supervisory board convenes 
supervisory board meetings giving at least fourteen 
days’ notice."
"The supervisory board must meet at 
least twice in a calendar half year and should meet 
once a quarter."
"In addition, supervisory board 
meetings must be convened if there is a special 
reason."
"In the fiscal year 2023, the supervisory 
board convened four ordinary meetings."
"All or individual members of the board of 
management participate in the meetings of the 
supervisory board as necessary."
"The supervisory 
board also has regular discussions without the 
board of management’s participation."
"The chairman 
of the supervisory board decides whether the 
members of the board of management are to 
participate or not."
"Whenever a member requests to 
participate, the supervisory board decides."
"If the 
auditor attends a meeting as an expert, the board of 
management and the head of finance do not attend 
this meeting unless the supervisory board deems it 
essential that they participate."
"The supervisory board has a quorum if all of its 
members have been invited and at least half of the 
members required by the articles of association 
participate in the resolution."
"Resolutions are passed 
by a majority vote of the participating board members."
"In the event of a tied vote, the chairman casts the 
deciding vote."
"Resolutions of the supervisory board 
may also be passed in a telephone or video 
conference or outside meetings by casting votes in 
writing, over the phone, or in text form if the 
chairman of the supervisory board so determines."
"This applies especially 
to members who are also members of the 
supervisory board of Volkswagen AG or the 
supervisory board of Porsche AG."
"If the supervisory 
board members determine that a conflict of interest 
exists, the members concerned do not participate in 
the vote on the relevant resolution or abstain from 
voting."
"Members of the supervisory board cannot 
participate in a vote by voting yes or no if the 
resolution concerns a transaction with the company 
in which they are involved as a party or if the 
resolution concerns the initiation of a lawsuit 
between such members and the company."
"The supervisory board assesses generally every two 
years the level of effectiveness with which the full 
supervisory board and its committees fulfill their 
duties."
"For this purpose, a questionnaire is 
distributed to the members of the supervisory board, 
in which they give their opinion as to the 
effectiveness of the working methods of the 
supervisory board and can suggest ways of 
improving them."
"The results of the evaluation of 
these questionnaires are discussed at the 
supervisory board’s next ordinary meeting, and 
possible improvements explored."
"The most recent 
self-assessment was conducted in the second half 
of the fiscal year 2022."
"As a matter of principle, the members of the 
supervisory board are responsible for obtaining the 
(further) training required for fulfilling their duties and 
are supported in these endeavors by Porsche SE 
both in terms of organization and by assuming any 
costs incurred."
"The most recent training for the full 
supervisory board took place in December 2022 
and provided information on current topics of 
relevance to the supervisory board of Porsche SE."
"Porsche SE also provides extensive support to new 
supervisory board members, including consulting 
internal and, if necessary, also external experts 
when they take office."
"In the fiscal year 2023, the supervisory board again 
performed all the duties assigned to it by law or the 
articles of association."
"The supervisory board 
advised the board of management on managing the 
company and carefully monitored its actions."
"The 
supervisory board was also involved in all 
fundamental decisions."
"It was informed by the 
board of management regularly, comprehensively 
and without delay about the key aspects of 
business development, the results of operations as 
well as the risks and their management."
"The 
supervisory board made its decisions based on 
comprehensive reports and proposals for resolution 
provided by the board of management."
"The 
supervisory board had ample opportunity to discuss 
the reports and proposals for resolutions of the 
board of management in plenary sessions and in 
the committees."
"The board of management 
comprehensively informed the supervisory board 
about projects and transactions of particular 
importance or urgency, both at and outside 
meetings."
"The supervisory board passed all 
resolutions required by law or the articles of 
association, sometimes also by circular resolutions."
"The chairman of the board was in constant contact 
with the board of management."
"It was therefore 
possible to discuss events of exceptional 
importance for the situation and development of the 
group without delay."
"The same applies for the work of 
the committees, which are described below."
"Committees of the supervisory board and 
their working methods 
In the fiscal year 2023, the supervisory board 
established a total of four committees (executive 
committee, audit committee, nominations 
committee and Phoenix committee) to carry out its 
duties."
"The Phoenix committee was dissolved in the 
current fiscal year as Project Phoenix was 
completed following the acquisition of 25% plus 
one share of the ordinary shares of Porsche AG and 
the conclusion of the corresponding financing 
agreements."
"The specific composition of the 
committees established in the fiscal year 2023 is 
presented in the attached overview."
"The committee meetings are convened by the 
respective committee chairman; as a rule, meetings 
should, if possible, be convened with no less than 
one week’s notice."
"Committees that take decisions 
on behalf of the supervisory board only have a 
quorum if all members participate in the resolution 
by voting or abstaining."
"Each committee chairman 
regularly informs the supervisory board about the 
activities of their committee."
"The committees support the supervisory board and 
prepare supervisory board resolutions as well as 
topics for discussion by the full supervisory board."
"Moreover, decision-making powers of the 
supervisory board may be delegated to the 
individual committees to the extent permitted by law."
"Executive committee 
 
In urgent cases, the executive committee decides 
on transactions that require the approval of the 
supervisory board in accordance with the rules of 
procedure of the board of management."
"The 
executive committee also functions as a personnel 
committee and makes recommendations to the 
supervisory board on concluding, amending and 
terminating contracts of employment for members 
of the board of management."
"The executive 
committee is responsible for approving any ancillary 
activities of the board of management members."
"This proposal is submitted to the 
supervisory board of Porsche SE for approval."
"Since the fiscal year 2023, the executive committee 
has also been responsible for preparing supervisory 
board resolutions and handling topics of discussion 
that are necessary or appropriate for implementing 
the investment strategy drawn up by the board of 
management."
"It may also make recommendations 
to the supervisory board."
"The executive committee comprises the chairman 
of the supervisory board, his deputy and an 
additional member of the supervisory board."
"The 
chairman of the supervisory board is also the 
chairman of the executive committee."
"The audit committee’s review of accounting 
particularly relates to the consolidated financial 
statements and the combined group management 
report, interim financial information and the annual 
financial statements prepared in accordance with 
HGB."
"The audit committee deals with the half-yearly 
financial report and the group quarterly statements 
for the supervisory board and discusses them with 
the board of management and the auditor."
"The audit 
committee also focuses on the dependent company 
report, the proposal for profit appropriation and, if 
necessary, the non-financial group report, and 
prepares them for review by the supervisory board."
"In connection with the audit, the audit committee 
submits to the supervisory board a recommendation 
for the appointment of the auditor, which – except in 
cases where the auditor is reappointed – is prepared 
following a selection procedure within the meaning 
of Art."
"16 (3) Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, includes 
at least two candidates and is substantiated."
"In 
addition, the audit committee monitors the 
independence of the auditor and ensures that the 
auditor’s non-audit services assigned by the board 
of management do not give rise to any indication of 
grounds for exclusion or disqualification or that 
endanger the independence of the auditor."
"The audit 
committee is authorized to award the audit 
engagement to the auditor elected by the annual 
general meeting, to agree on the fee with the auditor 
and to determine the key topics of its audit and its 
information duties on behalf of the supervisory board."
"It also deals with the key audit matters and regularly 
assesses the quality of the audit."
"Finally, the audit committee may, in accordance with 
the rules of procedures of the supervisory board, 
exercise the supervisory board’s special inspection 
and audit rights pursuant to Sec."
"111 (2) AktG 
where this appears necessary or useful in 
performing its duties."

entitled to obtain information from the auditor and 
the board of management in connection with the 
performance of its duties."
"Furthermore, each 
member of the audit committee may directly obtain 
information via the chairman of the audit committee 
from the heads of the corporate functions 
responsible for performing the duties relating to the 
audit committee."
The audit committee consists of three members.
"At 
least one member of the audit committee must have 
specialist knowledge in the area of accounting, and 
at least one other member must have specialist 
knowledge in the area of auditing."
"Accounting and 
auditing also include sustainability reporting and its 
audit and assurance."
"The chairman of the audit 
committee has to have appropriate expertise in at 
least one of the two areas."
"The chairman of the 
supervisory board should not chair the audit 
committee."

The above-mentioned requirements were met in the 
fiscal year 2023."
"Prof. Dr. Ulrich Lehner as chairman 
of the audit committee and Dr. Ferdinand Oliver 
Porsche as member of the audit committee each 
have the necessary expertise in the area of 
accounting and auditing."
"Both Prof. Dr. Ulrich 
Lehner and Dr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche have 
profound expertise in the areas of accounting and 
auditing due in particular to their many years of 
performing management duties as well as their 
activities as supervisory board members of large 
corporations."
"Prof. Dr. Ulrich Lehner also worked as 
a tax advisor and auditor and worked at various 
companies in the areas of controlling, accounting 
and finance for several years."
"Dr. Ferdinand Oliver 
Porsche has deepened his knowledge in the area of 
auditing and accounting through his many years as 
chairman on the audit committee of Volkswagen AG."
"The chairman of the board of management, the CFO, 
the board of management member responsible for 
legal affairs and compliance and the head of finance 
participate in the audit committee meetings unless 
the chairman of the audit committee decides 
otherwise in the individual case."
"If the auditor 
attends a meeting as an expert, the board of 
management and the head of finance do not attend 
this meeting unless the audit committee deems it 
essential that they participate."
"Regardless of this, 
the audit committee regularly consults with the 
auditor without the board of management’s 
participation."
"In addition, the chairman of the audit 
committee also communicates with the auditor 
outside of meetings and reports to the audit 
committee on this communication."
"Nominations committee 
 
The nominations committee recommends suitable 
candidates to the supervisory board for the 
supervisory board’s proposals to the annual general 
meeting concerning the election of supervisory 
board members."
"In the fiscal year 2023, the 
nominations committee convened once and 
proposed to the supervisory board that Ms."
"Sophie 
Piëch be elected for the first time and Mag."
"Josef 
Michael Ahorner, Mag."
"Marianne Heiß, Dr. Günther 
Horvath and Peter Daniell Porsche be elected for an 
additional term."
"The nominations committee consists of three 
members."
"The chairman of the supervisory board 
always acts as the chairman of the nominations 
committee."
"The Phoenix committee was authorized by 
the supervisory board to make decisions promoting 
the project to the extent permissible by law as a 
preparatory committee."
"Remuneration 
The remuneration of Porsche SE’s supervisory 
board members is governed by Art."
"13 of the 
articles of association."
"Pursuant to this, the 
members of the supervisory board receive fixed 
remuneration for their work, the exact amount of 
which depends on the duties assumed on the 
supervisory board or its committees, and 
reimbursement of their expenses."
"No variable 
compensation is paid."
"The remuneration of the 
members of the supervisory board was last 
submitted to the annual general meeting for 
resolution on 23 July 2021 and was unanimously 
approved by the annual general meeting."
"No 
adjustments were made to the existing 
remuneration system in the fiscal year 2023."
"The remuneration report for the fiscal year 2023 to  
be prepared by the board of management and the 
supervisory board and the auditor’s report pursuant  
to Sec."
"162 AktG as well as the most recent 
remuneration resolution pursuant to Sec."

"Securities transactions of the supervisory 
board members 
In accordance with Art."
"19 of the European Market 
Abuse Regulation, members of the supervisory 
board as well as persons closely associated with 
them must disclose managers’ transactions in 
Porsche SE shares or debt securities or any related 
derivatives or other related financial instruments."
"Porsche SE publishes announcements about 
transactions of this kind on the Porsche SE 
homepage and in other media."
"Shareholders and annual general 
meeting 
Porsche SE’s share capital is equally divided into 
ordinary shares and non-voting preference shares."
"To the extent provided for in the articles of 
association, the shareholders exercise their rights 
before or during the annual general meeting and, if 
they hold ordinary shares, exercise their voting 
rights."
"When passing resolutions, each ordinary 
share of Porsche SE carries one vote."
"There are no 
shares with multiple or preferential voting rights, nor 
are there any maximum voting rights."
"Every shareholder is entitled to take part in the 
annual general meeting, to express an opinion on 
items on the agenda, to table motions and to 
demand information about company matters if this 
is necessary to properly judge an item on the 
agenda."

Annual general meetings of Porsche SE may be 
held in person or virtually without the physical 
presence of the shareholders or their proxies."
"This 
option, which already existed in 2023 due to a 
transitional provision, will be available in the future 
as a result of an authorization in the articles of 
association approved by the annual general meeting 
in 2023."
"The annual general meeting decides on the 
appropriation of profits as well as the approval of 
the acts of the board of management and 
supervisory board and elects the members of the 
supervisory board and the auditor."
"The annual 
general meeting also decides in particular on the 
articles of association and the purpose of the 
company and on key corporate measures such as 
corporate contracts in particular."
"The investment result mainly 
comprises dividend income from the investment in 
Volkswagen AG amounting to €1,393 million  
(€4,253 million) and from the investment in 
Porsche AG amounting to €114 million (in the prior 
year no dividend income)."
"This is in line with the 
dividend income of €1.5 billion forecast in the 
combined group management report for the fiscal 
year 2022 for Porsche SE in the fiscal year 2023."
"The investment result also contains income (net) 
from profit and loss transfer agreements of  
€3 million (€3 million)."
"Other operating income from the reporting period 
primarily includes income from a claim for 
compensation against Volkswagen AG."
"The decrease in other operating expenses from  
€27 million to €20 million is due in particular to the 
consulting fees incurred in the prior year in 
connection with the acquisition of ordinary shares  
of Porsche AG."
"Income tax shows a net income in the reporting 
period."
"This is largely due to the reversal of 
provisions for income taxes for prior years due to 
new findings from the ongoing tax field audits and 
to income tax receivables recognized due to a tax 
loss carryback to the prior year."
"The increase is mainly due to 
capital increases in subsidiaries totaling €64 million."
"Receivables from affiliated companies contain 
receivables from domination and profit and loss 
transfer agreements."
"In the prior year, this also 
comprised a receivable of Porsche SE from 
Volkswagen AG of €22 million."
"Other assets of the 
prior year mainly included income tax receivables 
from withheld capital gains tax."
"Cash and cash equivalents contain bank balances 
including short-term time deposits."
"Provisions contain items for pensions and similar 
obligations, tax provisions as well as other 
provisions."
"In March 2023, Porsche SE successfully placed a 
Schuldschein loan of around €2.7 billion."
"Porsche 
SE issued three bonds with a total volume of  
€2.0 billion in the reporting period as part of a new 
debt issuance program set up."
"In the prior year, 
liabilities to banks comprised total bank financing of  
€7.1 billion."
"Of this amount, €3.9 billion related to a 
bridge loan with a term of up to two years,  
€3.0 billion to a bank loan with a term of five years  
 
 
 
and €0.2 billion to a bank loan with a term of three 
years."
"In the fiscal year, the bridge loan was repaid 
in full using the Schuldschein loan, the first bond of 
€750 million and also using the dividend payment 
from Volkswagen AG."
"Part of the five-year bank loan 
was repaid from the total proceeds of €1,250 million 
raised from the issuance of the other two loans."
"As before, the liabilities relate largely to loan 
relationships entered into with subsidiaries."
"At the level of the 
two core investments – Volkswagen AG and 
Porsche AG – business was largely impacted in the 
fiscal year 2023 by a challenging global market 
environment, parts supply shortages and 
disruptions in the logistics chain."
"In addition, the 
industry is shaped by fierce competition, 
technological transformation and increasing 
ecological awareness."
"Porsche SE’s net profit for the year under German 
commercial law of €1.4 billion (€4.1 billion) is largely 
attributable to the dividend income from the 
investments in Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG."
"The decrease in net profit for the year is  
mainly due to the special dividend of Volkswagen 
AG recognized in the prior year."
"The dividend 
income recognized in the fiscal year corresponds to 
the dividend income forecast in the combined group 
management report for the fiscal year 2022 for 
Porsche SE in the fiscal year 2023."
"In the reporting 
period, Porsche SE also collected income from the 
refund claim against Volkswagen."
"Risks relating to the business 
development 
The risks relating to the development of  
Porsche SE’s business are closely connected to 
the risks relating to the core investments in 
Volkswagen AG and in Porsche AG and to the 
development of the legal proceedings."
"The risks 
are described in the section “Opportunities and 
risks of future development”."
"Dividend proposal 
Porsche SE’s dividend policy is generally geared to 
stability (see also section “Goals and strategy” 
under “Fundamental information about the group”)."
"The separate financial statements of Porsche SE as 
of 31 December 2023 report a net profit available 
for distribution of €783 million consisting of a net 
profit of €1,441 million and a transfer to retained 
earnings of €658 million."
"Porsche SE’s board of 
management proposes a resolution for the 
distribution of a dividend of €2.554 (€2.554) per 
ordinary share and €2.560 (€2.560) per preference 
share, i.e., a total distribution of €783 million  
(€783 million)."

level of Porsche SE, which is likely to have a 
significant impact on the separate financial 
statements and net income for 2024."
"The board of

"The company is registered at the Stuttgart Local

"Porsche SE is a holding company with investments in the areas of mobility and industrial 
technology."
"Its business activities include in particular the acquisition, holding and management 
as well as the disposal of investments."
"In particular, Porsche SE holds the majority of the ordinary shares in Volkswagen 
Aktiengesellschaft, Wolfsburg (“Volkswagen AG”, “Volkswagen” or “VW”), one of the leading 
automobile manufacturers in the world."
Porsche SE also holds a direct interest in Dr. Ing.
"Porsche Aktiengesellschaft, Stuttgart (“Porsche AG”)."
"These long-term investments in 
Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG form the core investments category."
"In the portfolio 
investments category, the Porsche SE Group holds non-controlling interests in technology 
companies."
"Investments in private equity and venture capital funds are also allocated to this 
category."
"Portfolio investments are generally held by Porsche SE for a temporary period of time 
and are typically characterized by their high potential for growth and for increasing value during 
the holding period."
"In both categories, the sector focus is on mobility and industrial technology 
and is to be supplemented by investments in related areas in the future."
"This categorization of 
Porsche SE’s investments is also the basis for the segment reporting pursuant to IFRS 8 (see 
note [19])."
The consolidated financial statements of Porsche SE are prepared in accordance with Sec.

The fiscal year of the Porsche SE Group covers the period from 1 January to 31 December of a 
year."
The group’s presentation currency is the euro (€).
"Unless otherwise stated, all figures are 
presented in millions of euro (€ million)."
"All figures and percentages are rounded according to 
customary business practice, so minor discrepancies may arise from the addition of these 
amounts."
Amounts smaller than €0.5 million are stated at zero.
"Amounts of €0.00 are not 
reported."
"The comparative prior-year figures are presented in parentheses alongside the figures 
for the current reporting period."
The income statement has been prepared using the nature of expense method.
"The board of management prepared the consolidated financial statements and the combined 
group management report of Porsche SE by resolution on 13 March 2024."
"The period 
subsequent to the reporting date for which adjusting events can be disclosed ends on that date."
"These changes are due 
primarily to the changed system for calculating provisions related to the insurance business."
"At 
the level of Porsche SE, there are no business transactions that fall within the scope of IFRS 17."
"The adjustment of the prior-year figures at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries was made using the full 
retrospective approach, unless the application of that approach was impracticable."
"This was the 
case when not all of the required historical information, in particular for multi-year contracts, was 
available without undue cost and effort."
"In these cases, the Volkswagen Group including 
Porsche AG and its subsidiaries generally applied the modified retrospective approach."
"The effects from the first-time application of IFRS 17 on the consolidated balance sheet and 
consolidated income statement are presented in the reconciliations below."
"Already in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2023, the preference shares were 
therefore no longer classified as assets held for sale, resulting in a retrospective application of 
the equity method."
"The capital share, which the at equity accounting for the investment in 
Volkswagen AG has since been based on, amounts to around 31.9% compared to the 
approximately 31.4% previously."
"The adjustments to the prior-year consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the 
consolidated balance sheet for described above also resulted in corresponding adjustments 
being made to the consolidated statement of changes in equity."
"As of 1 January 2022, these 
related to retained earnings and other reserves (OCI) as well as the result after tax and other 
comprehensive income after tax for the fiscal year 2022."
"In the consolidated statement of cash flows from 1 January to 31 December 2022, corresponding 
adjustments were made to the result after tax, result from investments, income tax 
expense/income and other operating income included in other non-cash expenses and income."
"Application of IFRSs 
The accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are in line with the 
IFRSs adopted by the EU as of 31 December 2023."
"The amendments with regard to IAS 12 (“International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules”) 
result from around 140 countries agreeing on global minimum taxation (Pillar Two Model Rules)."
"A temporary exemption from accounting for deferred taxes was embedded in IAS 12, which 
applies if the deferred taxes arise from the implementation of Pillar Two Model Rules by the 
countries concerned."
"The effects on the Porsche SE Group are limited to indirect effects from 
the core investments in Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG."
"In accordance with the amendments 
to IAS 12, the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries does not take into 
account potential effects on deferred taxes from the introduction of the Pillar Two Model Rules."
"The amendments with regard to IAS 1 (“Disclosure of Accounting Policies”) are aimed at making 
disclosures on accounting policies more company-specific and therefore more useful for 
decision-making by narrowing the definition of materiality."
"The disclosures on the general 
consolidation principles, the determination of the scope of consolidation and the accounting 
policies have been revised against this backdrop."
"In particular, generally worded disclosures, 
which essentially represent a pure reproduction of IFRSs, have been reduced to a minimum."
"Where necessary, adjustments are made to uniform group accounting 
policies."
"The consolidated financial statements of Porsche SE include, in addition to Porsche SE, all 
entities controlled by Porsche SE as defined by IFRS 10 by means of full consolidation."
"Companies where Porsche SE is able, directly or indirectly, to significantly influence financial 
and operating policy decisions (associates) are accounted for at equity in the consolidated 
financial statements of Porsche SE."
Porsche SE holds the majority of voting rights in Volkswagen AG.
"The articles of 
association of Volkswagen AG prescribe that the State of Lower Saxony has a right to appoint 
two members of the supervisory board, provided that it holds at least 15% of the ordinary 
shares in Volkswagen AG."
"Where necessary, adjustments are made to uniform group accounting 
policies."
"The consolidated financial statements of Porsche SE include, in addition to Porsche SE, all

"The articles of 
association of Volkswagen AG prescribe that the State of Lower Saxony has a right to appoint 
two members of the supervisory board, provided that it holds at least 15% of the ordinary 
shares in Volkswagen AG."
"Due to the significant influence 
nonetheless exercised by Porsche SE, its investment in Volkswagen AG is thus accounted for in 
the consolidated financial statements of Porsche SE at equity."
The composition of the scope of consolidation as of 31 December 2023 is presented in note [3].
"Accounting policies 
The assets and liabilities of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are 
accounted for using uniform accounting policies applicable at the Porsche SE Group."
"Generally 
speaking, these accounting policies are also used at the level of the core investments included 
as associates."
"Measurement principles 
 
With the exception of certain items, for example the investments accounted for at equity or 
financial instruments measured at fair value, the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
using the historical cost principle (cost model)."
"The measurement principles used are described 
below in detail."
"Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
 
Goodwill acquired in business combinations is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there was no goodwill resulting from business 
combinations as of the reporting dates for the reporting periods presented."
"The costs are amortized using the straight-line 
method from the start of use over the useful life – generally between three and nine years."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, no development costs were incurred in the reporting 
periods presented."
"Other intangible assets 
 
Purchased intangible assets with finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortization and any accumulated impairment losses."
"Intangible assets with indefinite useful 
lives are not amortized, but instead tested annually for impairment."
"Intangible assets with finite 
useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life."
"Useful lives mainly range 
from three to five years."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, other intangible assets recognized as of the reporting 
dates for the reporting periods presented did not contain any assets with indefinite useful lives."
"Property, plant and equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment are measured using the cost model."
"Investment grants received 
for assets are generally deducted from cost."
"Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful life on a straight-line 
basis pro rata temporis."
"Depreciation is based mainly on the following useful lives: 
 
At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there is only other equipment, operating and office 
equipment."
The exemptions for short-term leases and leases for low-value assets are used.
"No right-of-use 
asset or liability is recognized for such leases and the lease payments are recognized as an 
expense in the income statement."
"The Porsche SE Group acts exclusively as lessee, in 
particular for buildings and vehicles."
"Leases for which right-of-use assets and liabilities are 
recognized are immaterial at the level of the Porsche SE Group; the right-of-use assets are 
recognized as non-current assets under property, plant and equipment and the lease liabilities 
as financial liabilities."
"At the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries, there are also 
leases that have Volkswagen group companies including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries as 
lessor."
"Vehicles leased out under operating leases are recognized at cost and depreciated to 
their estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the term of the lease."
"The 
forecast residual values are adjusted to include constantly updated internal and external 
information on residual values, depending on specific local factors and the experiences gained 
in the marketing of used cars."
"This requires making assumptions in particular about vehicle 
supply and demand in the future, as well as about vehicle price trends."
"Such assumptions are 
based either on qualified estimates or on data published by external experts."
"Qualified estimates 
are based on external data – if available - that reflects additional information that is available 
internally, such as historical experience and current sales data."
"Borrowing costs 
 
Borrowing costs of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the cost of these assets."
"A 
qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes at least a year to get ready for its intended use."
"There were no qualifying assets at the level of the Porsche SE Group in the reporting periods 
presented."

Investments accounted for at equity 
 
The cost of shares in associates and joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method."
"If additional interests are acquired in associates without a change in status, each tranche is 
generally accounted for separately using the equity method."
"In the course of a purchase price 
allocation, equity is remeasured for the acquired interests."
"Hidden reserves and liabilities of 
identifiable assets and liabilities are recognized in an ancillary calculation and carried forward in 
tranches to subsequent periods."
"Any negative difference between the pro rata remeasured 
equity of the investee and its acquisition cost is recognized directly through profit or loss as a 
bargain purchase."
Any positive difference is recognized as goodwill in the ancillary calculation.
"If information on significant intercompany profits from transactions between associates 
(sidestream transactions) is available, the Porsche SE Group eliminates intercompany profits 
equivalent to the product of its shares in both associates in the course of at equity accounting."
"Changes recognized directly in equity of the associate are also recognized directly on a pro rata 
basis in equity of the Porsche SE Group, provided these changes are not caused by 
transactions with Porsche SE itself."
"An impairment test for investments in associates is carried out whenever there is objective 
evidence that the entire carrying amount of the investment is impaired."
"This also includes 
proportionate market capitalization of the associate below the carrying amount."
"Expenses from 
impairments and income from reversals of impairment losses are recognized under the “result 
from investments accounted for at equity”."
"With regard to further information on the impairment 
tests for investments in associates, reference is made to the section “Accounting judgments, 
estimates and assumptions of the management at the level of the Volkswagen Group” in note [2] 
as well as to notes [4], [5] and [12]."
"Impairment test 
 
An impairment test is performed at least once a year for goodwill, intangible assets not yet 
available for use and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life."
"For assets in use and other 
intangible assets with finite useful lives as well as property, plant and equipment, an impairment 
test is only performed when there are specific indications that the asset may be impaired."
"At the 
end of each reporting period, the group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment."
"With respect to the procedure for impairment testing of investments accounted for at equity, 
reference is made to the section “Investments accounted for at equity”."
"With regard to further information on 
impairment tests at the level of the Volkswagen Group, reference is made to the section 
“Accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions of the management at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group” in note [2]."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there was no investment property as of the reporting dates 
of the reporting periods presented."
"Inventories 
 
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value as of the reporting date."
Borrowing costs are not capitalized.
"The measurement of same or similar inventories is generally 
based on the weighted average cost method."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there were no inventories as of the reporting dates of the 
reporting periods presented."
"Financial instruments 
 
Initial recognition of financial instruments 
  
If, within the scope of application of IFRS 9, the trade date of a financial instrument differs from 
the settlement date, it is initially accounted for at the settlement date."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there were no instances of application in the reporting 
periods presented that could have led to effects from the timing difference between the trade 
and settlement date."
"At the level of 
the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries, this category includes 
receivables from the financing business, trade receivables, other receivables and financial assets, 
time deposits, cash and cash equivalents."
"There were no financial assets (debt instruments) measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI debt instruments) at the level of the Porsche SE Group as of the 
reporting dates of the reporting periods presented."
"However, other comprehensive income of the 
Porsche SE Group does contain corresponding proportionate changes in fair value of FVOCI 
debt instruments at the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries 
as a result of applying at equity accounting."
"Upon initial recognition of an equity instrument as defined by IAS 32 not held for trading,  
the option can irrevocably be exercised to recognize fair value changes through other 
comprehensive income rather than through profit or loss."
"This option is currently not exercised 
at the Porsche SE Group."
"At the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its 
subsidiaries, this option is generally exercised for equity investments."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVtPL”) 
are largely made up of investments in portfolio companies as well as derivatives to which hedge 
accounting is not applied."
"At the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its 
subsidiaries, this category primarily comprises hedging relationships to which hedge accounting 
is not applied and investment fund units."
"The fair value option, according to which other 
financial assets can be designated as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition, 
is not applied."
Dividend income is recognized when the group’s right to receive the payment is established.
"Impairment losses on financial instruments 
 
Financial assets are exposed to default risk, which is taken into account by recognizing loss 
allowances or, if losses have already been incurred, by recognizing an impairment loss."
"Default 
risk on receivables and loans within the financial services business at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries is accounted for by recognizing 
specific loss allowances and portfolio-based loss allowances."

In particular, a loss allowance is recognized on these financial assets in the amount of the 
expected loss in accordance with uniform standards."
"The actual specific loss allowances of the 
losses incurred are then charged to this loss allowance."
"Insignificant receivables and significant individual 
receivables for which there is no indication of impairment are grouped into homogeneous 
portfolios on the basis of comparable credit risk features and allocated by risk class."
"Average 
historical default probabilities in combination with forward-looking parameters for the respective 
portfolio are then used to calculate the amount of the impairment loss."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there were no trade receivables as of the reporting dates 
of the reporting periods presented."
"The financial assets of Porsche SE that fall within the scope 
of application of the impairment model pursuant to IFRS 9 mainly consist of short-term 
securities, time deposits and cash and cash equivalents (see note [21])."
"Credit risks must be considered at the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and 
its subsidiaries for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI debt instruments 
as well as for contract assets in accordance with IFRS 15 and lease receivables within the scope 
IFRS 16."
"The rules on impairment also apply to risks from irrevocable credit commitments not 
recognized in the balance sheet and to the measurement of financial guarantees."
"Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities 
 
The fair value option for financial liabilities is not applied."
"At the Porsche SE Group, there are no liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as of the 
reporting dates of the reporting periods presented."
"At the Volkswagen Group including Porsche 
AG and its subsidiaries, this category includes derivatives that were not designated as hedging 
instruments."
"Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method mainly 
comprise trade payables, financial liabilities and other financial liabilities at the level of both the 
Porsche SE Group and the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries."

Derivative financial instruments 
 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value in subsequent periods."
"The 
accounting treatment of changes in fair value of hedging instruments depends on the nature of 
the hedging relationship."
"In the case of hedges against the risk of change in the fair value of 
balance sheet items (fair value hedges), both the hedging instrument and the hedged risk 
portion of the hedged item are measured at fair value."
"Gains or losses from the measurement of 
hedging instruments and hedged items are recognized through profit or loss."
"In the case of cash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are also measured at fair value."
"Both 
the designated effective portion of the hedging instrument as well as the non-designated 
effective portion of the hedging instruments (“hedging costs”) are recognized in the cash flow 
hedge reserve via other comprehensive income."
"The effects are only reclassified through profit 
or loss when the hedged item is realized."
"The ineffective portion of a hedging instrument is 
recognized through profit or loss immediately."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, only interest rate hedges are accounted for as cash flow 
hedges under hedge accounting."
"At Porsche SE, no hedging costs within the meaning of IFRS 9 
were incurred in the reporting periods presented."
"In addition to the provisions of IFRS 9 for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, the 
Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries also applies the provisions of IAS 
39 on portfolio hedges to hedge interest rate risk in the financial services division."
This also applies to options on shares.
"External hedging instruments of intragroup hedged items that are subsequently eliminated in the 
consolidated financial statements of Volkswagen AG/Porsche AG are also assigned to this 
category as a general rule."
"At the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries, 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss consist of derivatives or 
components of derivatives that are not included in hedge accounting."
"These relate for example 
to the non-designated currency forwards used to hedge revenue, interest rate hedges, 
commodity forwards and currency forwards relating to commodity forwards."

Fair value of financial instruments 
 
Fair value generally corresponds to the market or quoted market price."
"If no active market exists 
for a financial instrument, fair value is determined using other observable inputs as far as 
possible."
"The amortized carrying amount of current financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair 
value generally provides an approximation of their fair value."
"Income tax 
 
As the timing of the reversal of the temporary taxable differences in connection with the 
investment in associates, Volkswagen AG in particular, cannot be managed due to lack of 
control, deferred tax liabilities are recognized on these temporary differences."
"Deferred and current tax relating to items recognized through other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity is likewise recognized through other comprehensive income or directly in equity."
"This also includes deferred taxes on the investment in Porsche AG and in particular in 
Volkswagen AG."
"Share-based payment 
 
Share-based payment at the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its 
subsidiaries comprises cash-settled performance share plans that are recognized in accordance 
with IFRS 2."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there were no share-based payments in the reporting 
periods presented."
Discounting is based on market interest rates.
The settlement value also reflects any cost increases that are expected.
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there were no significant discounting effects from the 
measurement of other provisions."
"At the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG 
and its subsidiaries, an average discount rate of 2.87% (3.16%) was used in the eurozone."
"Government grants 
 
Government grants related to assets are deducted when arriving at the carrying amount of the 
asset and are recognized in profit or loss over the life of the depreciable asset as a reduced 
depreciation expense."
"Government grants related to income, i.e., that compensate for expenses 
incurred, are generally recognized in profit or loss for the period and allocated to those items in 
which the expenses to be compensated by the grants are also recognized."
"At the Porsche SE Group, there were no accounting issues in connection with government 
grants in the reporting periods presented."
"Income and expenses 
 
Revenue, interest and commission income from financial services of the Volkswagen Group 
including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries as well as other operating income are recognized only 
when the relevant services have been rendered or the goods have been delivered, i.e."
"when the 
customer has obtained control of the goods or services."
"Revenue of the Volkswagen Group 
including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries is reported net of sales allowances (discounts, price 
concessions, customer bonuses and rebates)."
"The Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and 
its subsidiaries measures sales allowances and other variable consideration on the basis of 
experience and by taking account of current circumstances."
"Vehicles are normally sold to 
dealers on payment terms."
"At the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries, 
a trade receivable is recognized for the period between vehicle delivery and receipt of payment."
"Any financing component included in the transaction is only recognized if the period between 
the transfer of the goods and the payment of consideration is longer than one year and the 
amount to be accrued is significant."

Income from financing and finance lease agreements at the level of the Volkswagen Group 
including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries is recognized using the effective interest method."
"If 
non-interest-bearing or low-interest vehicle financing arrangements are agreed, revenue for the 
vehicles of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries is reduced by the 
interest benefits granted."
"Revenue from operating leases is recognized at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries over the term of the contract on a 
straight-line basis."
"As a rule, the stage of completion is determined at the level of the Volkswagen 
Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries as the proportion that contract costs incurred 
by the end of the reporting period bear to the estimated total contract costs (cost-to-cost 
method)."
"Contract costs incurred at the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG 
and its subsidiaries generally represent the best way to measure the stage of completion for the 
performance obligation."
"If the outcome of a performance obligation satisfied over time is not 
sufficiently certain, but the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries expects, 
as a minimum to recover its costs from the customer, revenue is only recognized in the amount 
of the contract costs incurred."
"A trade receivable is recognized as soon 
as the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries has transferred the goods 
or services in full."
"If services are sold to the customer at the same time as the vehicle, and the customer pays for 
them in advance, the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries recognizes a 
corresponding contract liability until the services have been transferred."
"Examples of services 
that customers pay for in advance at the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG 
and its subsidiaries are servicing, maintenance and certain warranty contracts as well as mobile 
online services."
"For extended warranties granted to all customers for a particular model, a 
provision is normally recognized at the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and 
its subsidiaries in the same way as for statutory warranties."
"If the warranty is optional for the 
customer or it includes an additional service component, the related revenue is deferred and 
realized over the term of the warranty."
"Income from the sale of assets for which a company of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche 
AG and its subsidiaries has a buyback obligation is recognized only when the assets have 
definitively left the group."
"If a fixed repurchase price was agreed when the contract was entered 
into, the difference between the selling price and present value of the repurchase price is 
recognized ratably as income over the term of the contract."
"If variable consideration 
has been agreed in the contract (e.g., volume-based bonus payments), the large number of 
contracts involved at the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its 
subsidiaries means that revenue has to be estimated using the expected value method."
"In 
exceptional cases, the most probable amount method may also be used."
"Once the expected 
revenue has been estimated, an additional check is carried out to determine whether there is 
any uncertainty that necessitates the reversal of the revenue initially recognized so that it can be 
virtually ruled out that revenue subsequently has to be adjusted downward."
"At the level of the 
Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries, provisions for reimbursements 
arise mainly from dealer bonuses."
"In multiple-element arrangements at the level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG 
and its subsidiaries, the transaction price is allocated to the different performance obligations of 
the contract on the basis of relative standalone selling prices."
"In the automotive division at the 
level of the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries, non-vehicle-related 
services are generally measured at their standalone selling prices for reasons of materiality."
"Production- and manufacture-related expenses are recognized upon delivery or rendering of the 
service, while all other expenses are expensed as incurred."
"The latter applies for research costs 
and for development costs not eligible for recognition."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, no revenue was generated in the reporting periods 
presented."
"Currency translation 
 
In the separate IFRS financial statements for group accounting purposes of Porsche SE and the 
consolidated subsidiaries, no significant business transactions were denominated in foreign 
currency in the reporting periods presented."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, there were 
also no financial statements of foreign companies in the reporting periods presented that had to 
be translated into euros for the purpose of full consolidation."
"However, the Porsche SE Group is affected indirectly by currency translations at the level of the 
associates through the subsequent measurement of their carrying amounts accounted for at 
equity."
"Actual results may deviate from these 
estimates."
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
"Revisions 
of estimates are recognized prospectively."
"Porsche SE is mainly indirectly exposed to the potential effects of climate change and possible 
regulatory changes in this regard through its holding activities – via its core investments in 
Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG."
"Provisions have been set 
up for the expected attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses."
"The outcome of litigation is subject 
to substantial estimation risks."
"Beyond the direct effects, the estimation risks at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group with regard to the diesel issue may also have significant indirect effects on 
the Porsche SE Group."
"This largely relates to the result from investments accounted for at equity 
(see notes [4] and [5]) and the carrying amount of the investment in Volkswagen AG accounted 
for at equity (see notes [4] and [12]) as well as potential subsequent effects of an amended 
dividend policy of Volkswagen AG."
"With regard to the legal risks in connection with the diesel 
issue at the level of the Volkswagen Group, reference is made to the subsection “Litigation and 
diesel issue” in the section “Accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions of the 
management at the level of the Volkswagen Group”."
"Assumptions relating to the Volkswagen Group’s planning 
 
The planning period of the Volkswagen Group’s multi-year planning generally covers five years."
"The planning for the Volkswagen Group’s financial services segment is likewise prepared on the 
basis of these expectations, and also reflects the relevant market penetration rates of expected 
vehicle sales with finance or lease agreements and other services, as well as regulatory 
requirements."
"The planning for the Volkswagen Group’s power engineering segment reflects 
expectations about trends in the various individual markets."
"The planning includes reasonable 
assumptions about macroeconomic trends (exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price 
trends) and historical developments."

The Volkswagen Group’s planning is based on the assumption that global economic output will 
grow overall in 2024 albeit at a slower pace."
"Volkswagen expects the persistently high inflation 
in many regions and the resulting restrictive monetary policy measures taken by central banks to 
have an increasingly adverse effect on consumer spending."
"From Volkswagen’s point of view, 
risks will continue to arise from protectionist tendencies, turbulence in the financial markets and 
structural deficits in individual countries."
"In addition, Volkswagen sees continuing geopolitical 
tensions and conflicts as weighing on growth prospects; risks are associated in particular with 
the Russia-Ukraine war and the confrontations in the Middle East."
"Nevertheless, Volkswagen 
assumes that both the advanced economies and the emerging markets will show positive 
momentum on average, albeit with below-average growth in gross domestic product."
"Volkswagen also expects the global economy to recover in 2025 and continue a path of stable 
growth until 2028."
"The Volkswagen Group’s automotive market and volume planning reflects the above regional 
differentiation and takes account of the impact of regional conflicts."
"With regard to the impact of climate change, reference is made to the 
section below."
"In addition, the Volkswagen Group’s planning is based on the assumption that 
the supply situation for intermediates and commodities will improve from fiscal year 2024 
onward."
"The Porsche AG Group anticipates an increase in the operating return on sales for the 
medium term with the long-term target of more than 20%."
"The planning assumptions are adapted by the Volkswagen Group to reflect the current state of 
knowledge."
"Effects of climate change 
 
Against the backdrop of climate change and the resulting stricter emissions regulations, the 
transformation of the automotive industry towards e-mobility and further digitalization continues 
to make progress."
"In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Volkswagen AG, 
the board of management of Volkswagen AG took into account the potential effects of climate 
change and future regulatory requirements, and especially the corresponding transformation 
towards e-mobility."
"Potential effects, especially on non-current assets, provisions for emissions 
levies and future cash flows were, as far as possible, incorporated as part of the significant 
estimates and assumptions included in the consolidated financial statements of Volkswagen AG."
"The Volkswagen Group aims to increase the share of all-electric vehicles as a proportion of total 
deliveries from 8.3% in 2023 to more than 50% in 2030."
"The Volkswagen Group aims to offer its 
customers worldwide around 50 completely battery-electric models by 2030."
"The Porsche AG 
Group aims to increase the share of all-electric vehicles as a proportion of total deliveries from 
around 13% in 2023 to more than 80% in 2030, depending on demand and the development of 
electromobility in the individual regions of the world."
"An amount in the low triple-digit billion euro range has 
been earmarked for this purpose in the multi-year operational planning of the Volkswagen Group."
"In addition, Volkswagen regularly assesses whether these developments give rise to the need for 
ad hoc impairment tests or for adjustments to the useful lives of other non-current non-financial 
assets."
"With reference to increasingly stringent 
emissions regulations, according to Volkswagen’s annual report for the fiscal year 2023, 
Volkswagen ensures that the various international regulations are taken into account and that 
any obligations are recognized appropriately."
"The same applies for Porsche AG and the 
consolidated financial statements of Porsche AG."
"This did not result in any material effects on 
the consolidated financial statements of Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG."
"Litigation and diesel issue 
  
Volkswagen AG and the companies in which it is directly or indirectly invested, i.e., including the 
Porsche AG Group, are involved in a substantial number of legal disputes and governmental 
proceedings in Germany and abroad."
"Such legal disputes and other proceedings occur, among 
other things, in connection with products and services or in relation to employees, public 
authorities, dealers, investors, customers, suppliers, or other contracting parties."
"For the 
companies in question, these disputes and proceedings may result in payments such as fines or 
in other obligations or consequences."
"In particular, substantial compensatory or punitive 
damages may have to be paid and cost-intensive measures may have to be implemented."
"In this 
context, specific estimation of the objectively likely consequences is often possible only to a 
very limited extent, if at all."
"Various legal proceedings are pending worldwide, particularly in the USA, in which customers 
are asserting purported product-related claims, either individually or in class actions."
"These 
claims are as a rule based on alleged vehicle defects, including defects alleged in vehicle parts 
supplied to the Volkswagen Group."
Compliance with legal or regulatory requirements is another area in which risks may arise.
"This is 
particularly true in gray areas where Volkswagen and Porsche AG and the relevant public 
authorities may interpret the law differently."
"It is not possible to predict with assurance how government 
regulators will assess certain issues of fact and law in a particular situation."
"For this reason, the 
possibility that certain vehicle characteristics and/or type approval aspects may in particular 
ultimately be deemed deficient or impermissible cannot be ruled out."
"This is fundamentally a 
question of the regulatory agency’s specific evaluation in a concrete situation."
"A comparable challenge results from the tension between divergent national and international 
statutory or regulatory requirements regarding obligations to transfer information or documents, 
on the one hand, and privacy mandates under national and international data protection law on 
the other."
"Volkswagen is advised by outside law firms on these issues so as to preclude 
compliance violations as far as possible despite the sometimes unclear state of the law."
"Litigation may furthermore result from demands for more extensive climate protection measures 
or from allegedly incomplete disclosures regarding the impact of climate change."
"Risks may also result from actions for infringement of intellectual property, including 
infringement of patents, brands, or other third-party rights, particularly in Germany, before the 
Unified Patent Court and in the USA."
"Criminal acts by individuals, which even the best compliance management system can never 
completely prevent, are another potential source of legal risks."
"Appropriate insurance has been taken out at the level of the Volkswagen Group to cover these 
risks where they were sufficiently definite and such coverage was economically sensible."
"As some risks 
cannot be assessed or can only be assessed to a limited extent, the possibility of material loss 
or damage not covered by the insured amounts or by provisions cannot be ruled out."
"This is, for 
instance, the case with regard to the legal risks assessed in connection with the diesel issue 
presented below."

Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the amounts disclosed for the litigation being reported on 
refer only to the respective principal claim."
"Ancillary claims, such as for interest and litigation 
expense, are generally not considered."
"On 18 September 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) publicly announced in 
a notice of violation that irregularities in relation to nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions had been 
discovered in emissions tests on certain Volkswagen Group vehicles with 2.0 l diesel engines in 
the USA."
"In this context, Volkswagen AG announced that noticeable discrepancies between the 
figures recorded in testing and those measured in actual road use had been identified in type EA 
189 diesel engines and that this engine type had been installed in roughly eleven million vehicles 
worldwide."
"On 2 November 2015, the EPA issued a notice of violation alleging that irregularities 
had also been discovered in the software installed in US vehicles with type V6 3.0 l diesel 
engines."
"The so-called diesel issue is rooted in a modification of parts of the software of the 
relevant engine control units – which, according to Volkswagen AG’s legal position, is only 
unlawful under US law – for the type EA 189 diesel engines that Volkswagen AG was developing 
at that time."
"This software function was developed and implemented from 2006 on without 
knowledge at the level of the Volkswagen’s board of management."
"Members of Volkswagen’s 
board of management did not learn of the development and implementation of this software 
function until the summer of 2015."
"Should these legal or estimation risks materialize, this could result in further 
substantial financial charges at the level of the Volkswagen Group."
"In particular, adjustment of 
the provisions recognized at the level of the Volkswagen Group and this having an indirect 
impact at the level of the Porsche SE Group in light of knowledge acquired or events occurring 
in the future cannot be ruled out."
"Criminal and administrative proceedings worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada) 
Criminal investigations, regulatory offense proceedings, and/or administrative proceedings have 
been commenced in some countries."
"Criminal investigations into the core factual issues are 
being conducted by the Offices of the Public Prosecutor in Braunschweig and Munich."
"Pursuant to a motion filed by the Braunschweig 
Office of the Public Prosecutor, the Braunschweig Regional Court reopened the proceedings 
against the former chair of the board of management of Volkswagen AG in December 2023."
"This case will now move forward; the Braunschweig Regional Court has as yet set no date for 
commencement of the trial."
"In September 2020, the Braunschweig Regional Court allowed the indictment of the same 
former chair of the board of management of Volkswagen AG to proceed on charges that 
include fraud in connection with the diesel issue involving type EA 189 engines."
"The 
proceedings against this former chair of the board of management of Volkswagen AG have 
since been severed from the other cases."
"The trial of the other defendants began in 
September 2021."
"The Braunschweig Office of the Public Prosecutor conducted investigations on suspicion of 
fraud in connection with type EA 288 engines."
"The proceedings against the accused 
Volkswagen employees and against Volkswagen AG were terminated in late 2022 and early 
2023, definitively against payment of a sum set by the court in the case of three of the 
accused persons and provisionally as regards four others."
"The trial before the Munich II Regional Court concluded in June 2023; the former chair of the 
board of management of AUDI AG and the other two defendants were sentenced to prison 
terms, the enforcement of which was in each case suspended subject to probation."
"The 
conditions of probation include the payment of sums set by the court."
"The judgment is not 
yet final."
All three defendants have filed appeals on issues of law.
"The Office of the Public 
Prosecutor has likewise appealed the judgment against one of the defendants."
"In April 2023, 
the Munich II Regional Court had previously terminated the proceedings against an additional 
former defendant against payment of a sum set by the court."
"In August 2020, the Munich II Office of the Public Prosecutor issued a further indictment 
charging three former members of the board of management of AUDI AG and others with, 
among other things, fraud in connection with the diesel issue involving 3.0 l and 4.2 l TDI 
engines."
The Munich II Regional Court has not yet decided whether to accept the indictment.

As the type approval authority of proper jurisdiction, the KBA is moreover continuously 
testing Audi, Volkswagen, and Porsche brand vehicles for problematic functions."
"If certain 
functions are deemed impermissible by the KBA, the affected vehicles are recalled pursuant 
to a recall order or they are brought back into compliance by means of a voluntary service 
measure."
"In judgments rendered in July and November 2022, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) 
ruled that a so-called thermal window (i.e., a temperature-dependent exhaust gas 
recirculation) in the range of 15°C and 33°C outside temperature represents a defeat device."
"In July and October 
2023, the KBA issued two administrative rulings against AUDI AG in which it ruled that the 
originally incorporated thermal window version failed to meet the ECJ’s new vehicle 
engineering criterion in some of the affected vehicles."
"AUDI AG has appealed the rulings, and 
they are therefore not final."
"The KBA issued corresponding administrative rulings against 
Porsche AG in December 2023 and against Volkswagen AG in January 2024."
"Porsche AG 
and Volkswagen AG have appealed the rulings."
"The Volkswagen Group had previously 
already begun rolling out software updates that modify the thermal window in accordance 
with the ECJ’s new vehicle engineering criterion and will continue to do so."
Altitude correction refers to altitude-dependent exhaust gas recirculation.
"The taxi switch modifies exhaust gas recirculation when a vehicle with a running engine 
stands motionless for a certain period of time."
"Volkswagen AG is involved in the litigation as 
an interested party summoned."
"In late April 2023, Volkswagen AG and the KBA filed appeals 
against the judgment of the Schleswig Administrative Court."
"This decision is thus not legally 
final."
DUH has filed two additional lawsuits with the Schleswig Administrative Court.
"In the first action, the Schleswig Administrative Court issued a judgment 
in January 2024 that extended its initial February 2023 decision to additional vehicles with 
type EA 189 engines and invalidated the KBA’s notices of approval for these vehicles."
"The 
court granted both leave to appeal (on points of fact and law) and to leap-frog appeal (on 
points of law)."
This decision is thus not legally final.

Moreover, additional administrative proceedings relating to the diesel issue are ongoing in 
other jurisdictions."
"The companies of the Volkswagen Group are cooperating with the 
government authorities."
"Risks may furthermore result from possible decisions by the European Court of Justice 
construing EU type approval provisions."
"Whether the criminal and administrative proceedings will ultimately result in fines or other 
consequences for the companies of the Volkswagen Group, and if so what amounts these 
may entail, is currently subject to estimation risks."
"According to Volkswagen’s estimates, the 
likelihood that a sanction will be imposed is 50% or less in the majority of these proceedings."
"Contingent liabilities have therefore been disclosed by Volkswagen where the amount of such 
liabilities could be measured and the likelihood of a sanction being imposed by Volkswagen 
was assessed at not less than 10%."
"Product-related lawsuits worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada) 
A general possibility exists that customers in the affected markets will file civil lawsuits or that 
importers and dealers will assert recourse claims against Volkswagen AG and other 
Volkswagen Group companies."
"Besides individual lawsuits, various forms of collective 
actions (i.e., assertion of individual claims by plaintiffs acting jointly or as representatives of a 
class) are available in various jurisdictions."
"Furthermore, in a number of markets it is possible 
for consumer and/or environmental organizations to bring suit to enforce alleged rights to 
injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, or damages."
"These 
actions asserted alleged rights to damages and other relief."
"The pending actions included in 
particular the following: 
Pending in Belgium is a class action filed by the Belgian consumer organization Test Aankoop 
VZW seeking repayment of the purchase price or damages in the alternative; an opt-out 
mechanism has been held to apply to this action."
"Given the opt-out rule, the class action 
potentially covers all vehicles with type EA 189 engines purchased by consumers on the 
Belgian market after 1 September 2014, unless the right to opt out is actively exercised."
"The judgment is not yet 
final."

In Brazil, two consumer protection class actions are pending."
"Following Volkswagen do Brasil’s appeal, the 
Superior Court of Justice vacated its own prior decision in its entirety."
"The case was 
remanded to the lower appellate court for rehearing of certain issues."
"Volkswagen do Brasil is 
permitted to introduce new evidence."
"The judgment is enforceable, but remains non-final."
"In 
the second class action, which pertains to roughly 67 thousand later generation Amarok 
vehicles, the appeal filed by the plaintiff against the October 2021 trial court judgment 
dismissing its complaint was rejected by the appellate court in June 2023."
"The plaintiff has 
appealed this decision to the Superior Court of Justice."
"Following the withdrawal of numerous motions for relief, approximately 9 thousand 
claims are currently still pending."
"Provisions were recognized to account for the possibility 
that objectively valuable claims may again be raised in or out of court."
"These actions are in a very early procedural 
stage."
"No group company has as yet been formally served with a complete statement of the 
grounds of the complaint, and a number of the plaintiffs’ claims have yet to be specified in 
detail."
"This is an 
opt-in class action in which CLCV is primarily seeking rescission without compensation for 
use of the vehicle or, in the alternative, damages amounting to 20-30% of the purchase price."
"The judgment was largely overturned pursuant to the appeal filed by 
Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Group Italia."
"Per this decision, the consumers validly 
registered in the class action will receive merely €300 each."
"A 
declaratory judgment partially granting the relief sought was issued in July 2021."
"In the 
opinion of the court, Volkswagen AG and the other defendant Group companies acted 
unlawfully with respect to the original engine management software."
"The court moreover held 
that consumers are entitled to a purchase price reduction from the defendant dealerships."
"No 
specific payment obligations result from the declaratory judgment."
"Any individual claims 
would then have to be established afterwards in separate proceedings."
"Volkswagen AG and 
the other defendant group companies appealed the decision."
"Furthermore, an opt-out class 
action lawsuit brought by the Diesel Emissions Justice Foundation (“DEJF”) seeking monetary 
damages on behalf of Dutch consumers is also pending; the action involves vehicles with 
type EA 189 engines, among others."
"The trial court rendered an interlocutory judgment in 
March 2022 holding the new class action regime – which permits damage awards in addition 
to declaratory judgment on the existence of claims – to be inapplicable to the instant lawsuit."
"The interlocutory judgment further finds that the Amsterdam court lacks jurisdiction to hear 
lawsuits brought by consumers outside the Netherlands."
"The court suspended further trial level proceedings pending 
a decision by the appellate court."
"In Portugal, a Portuguese consumer organization had filed an opt-out class action potentially 
affecting up to approximately 70 thousand vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"In July 2023, 
the Supreme Court dismissed the class action as inadmissible because the plaintiff consumer 
organization lacked standing to sue."
The judgment became final in September 2023.
"In South Africa, an opt-out class action seeking damages is pending; the action pertains to 
some 80 thousand vehicles, including vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"Furthermore, individual lawsuits and similar proceedings are pending against Volkswagen AG 
and other Volkswagen Group companies in various countries; most of these lawsuits are 
seeking damages or rescission of the purchase contract."
"In Germany, roughly 25 thousand individual lawsuits relating to various diesel engine types 
are currently pending against Volkswagen AG or other group companies, with the plaintiffs 
suing for damages or rescission of the contract in most cases."
"In 2020, the BGH issued a series of fundamental judgments deciding legal issues of major 
importance for the litigation still pending with regard to vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"The BGH held that buyers who had purchased vehicles prior to public disclosure of the diesel 
issue could return their vehicles to Volkswagen AG and receive a refund of the purchase price 
paid, less a deduction for the benefit derived from using the vehicle."
"The BGH held that 
buyers must return their vehicles in order to claim payment and that such payment was 
reduced by the benefit derived from using the vehicle and by the dealer profit margin."
"In an 
additional fundamental judgment rendered in July 2022 concerning vehicles with EA 189 
engines, the BGH held that buyers of new vehicles of other group brands have no claim for 
residual damages against Volkswagen AG."
"In late June 2023, the BGH handed down judgments in lawsuits against Volkswagen AG and 
AUDI AG posing the issue as to how the case law of the ECJ on the potential claims of 
buyers under European type approval law should be implemented in German law."
"The BGH 
held that the negligent use of an impermissible defeat device may in principle entitle plaintiffs 
to differential damages in tort amounting to 5% to 15% of their vehicle’s purchase price."
Whether this claim is given in a particular instance is for the appeals courts to determine.
"The 
BGH stated that, when deciding whether a deactivation device was impermissible, it did not 
matter whether the limits in the NEDC testing procedure would be complied with even when 
system functioning was modified."
"Where a claim for differential 
damages exists in principle, the buyer must furthermore accept an offset for the benefit 
derived from using the vehicle and for the vehicle’s value to the extent these exceed the 
vehicle’s diminished value."
"An implemented software update may also potentially mitigate 
damages."
"Volkswagen estimates the likelihood that the plaintiffs will prevail to be 50% or less in the 
great majority of cases: customer class actions, complaints filed by consumer and/or 
environmental organizations, and individual lawsuits."
"Contingent liabilities are disclosed by 
Volkswagen for these proceedings where the amount of such liabilities can be measured and 
the chance that the plaintiff will prevail was assessed by Volkswagen as not remote."
"Given 
the early stage of the proceedings, it is in some cases not yet possible to quantify the realistic 
risk exposure."
"Furthermore, provisions were recognized at the level of the Volkswagen Group 
to the extent necessary based on the current assessment."
"At this time, it cannot be estimated by Volkswagen how many customers will choose to file 
lawsuits in the future in addition to those already pending and what prospect of success such 
lawsuits might have."

"Almost all investor lawsuits are now pending before the Braunschweig Regional Court or the 
Braunschweig Higher Regional Court."
"The investor lawsuits pending 
against Volkswagen AG in Germany are stayed pending resolution of the common issues, 
unless the cases can be dismissed for reasons independent of the common issues that are to 
be adjudicated in the model case proceedings."
"The resolution in the model case proceedings 
of the common questions of law and fact will be binding for the pending cases that have 
been stayed as described."
The model case plaintiff is Deka Investment GmbH.
"Oral argument 
in the model case proceedings before the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court began in 
September 2018."
"The Braunschweig Higher Regional Court issued several notification rulings 
stating its position on certain legal issues of fundamental importance for the litigation."
"In July 
2023, the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court issued an order for the taking of evidence 
including the examination of numerous persons as well as the production and consultation of 
documents and records."
"Volkswagen 
AG has the burden of proof on some issues."
"The taking of testimony commenced in September 
2023."
"To date, none of the witnesses examined has testified to having personal knowledge or to 
knowledge on the part of persons with ad hoc disclosure responsibility."
"Several witnesses 
invoked a privilege against giving testimony."
"In some cases (not as to persons with ad hoc 
disclosure responsibility), the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court affirmed a comprehensive 
right to refuse to testify."
"The implications of the refusal to testify given Volkswagen AG’s burden 
of proof cannot be assessed abstractly."
"286 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court must decide at its discretion and conviction, taking 
account of the entire content of the hearings and the results of the evidence taken."
"Further investor lawsuits are pending before the Stuttgart Regional Court against Volkswagen 
AG, in some cases along with Porsche SE as joint and several debtor."
"To date, claims in the high triple-digit-millions range have been withdrawn or finally 
and conclusively dismissed."
"Volkswagen AG remains of the opinion that it duly complied with 
its capital market obligations."
"Therefore, no provisions have been recognized for these 
investor lawsuits at the level of the Volkswagen Group."
"Contingent liabilities have been 
disclosed by Volkswagen where the chance of success was estimated by Volkswagen to be 
not less than 10%."
"In November 2023, Volkswagen reached a settlement agreement resolving the environmental 
claims brought by the Attorney General of the State of Texas and various Texas municipalities 
against Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., and certain affiliates."
"The 
settlement agreement became final in January 2024 after it was approved by the court."
"In 
November 2023, Volkswagen also finalized a settlement agreement resolving the 
environmental claims brought by two municipalities (Hillsborough County, Florida and Salt 
Lake County, Utah) against Volkswagen Group of America, Inc."
"In August 2020, the US District Court for the Northern District of 
California dismissed, among other things, all claims against VW Credit, Inc."
"relating to asset-
backed securities."
"In September 2020, the SEC filed an amended complaint that, among 
other things, removed the dismissed claims."
"In line with IAS 37.92, no statements have been made concerning estimates of financial 
impact or regarding uncertainty as to the amount or maturity of provisions and contingent 
liabilities in relation to proceedings in the USA/Canada."
"This is so as to not compromise the 
results of the proceedings or the interests of the company."
"Special audit  
In a November 2017 ruling, the Higher Regional Court of Celle ordered, upon the request of 
three US funds, the appointment of a special auditor for Volkswagen AG."
"The special auditor 
was supposed to examine whether the members of the board of management and 
supervisory board of Volkswagen AG breached their duties in connection with the diesel issue 
from 22 June 2006 onwards and, if so, whether this resulted in damages for Volkswagen AG."
"Volkswagen 
AG also filed a constitutional complaint against the subsequent (and likewise formally 
unappealable) decision by the Higher Regional Court of Celle to appoint a special auditor 
other than the one initially appointed."
"Proceedings in the 
case concerning the replacement of the special auditor were suspended until the completion 
of the taking of evidence."
"Volkswagen AG had in addition previously filed an action before the 
Braunschweig Regional Court seeking to enjoin the special auditor from performing the audit 
as long as he had not furnished sufficient proof of his independence."
"The Braunschweig 
Regional Court dismissed the action for injunctive relief in the summer of 2022; Volkswagen 
AG then appealed this decision to the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court."
"A second motion seeking appointment of a special auditor for Volkswagen AG to examine 
matters relating to the diesel issue was filed with the Regional Court of Hanover."
"The 
proceedings in this matter were resumed after initially being stayed pending the decision of 
the Federal Constitutional Court in the first special audit case."
"In line with IAS 37.92, no further statements have been made by the Volkswagen Group 
concerning estimates of financial impact or regarding uncertainty as to the amount or maturity of 
provisions and contingent liabilities in relation to the diesel issue."
"This is so as to not 
compromise the results of the proceedings or the interests of the company."
"Consequently, from 
today’s perspective, the Porsche AG Group does not expect that Porsche AG group will be 
subject to any significant outflow of resources in this regard."
"It was agreed to not plea the statute of limitations until 31 July 2023 and this was 
subsequently extended until 31 July 2025."
"No extensive provisions are recognized at the level of the Porsche AG 
Group for future expected outflows of resources."
"The 
estimates made in order to derive cash flows mainly relate to future market shares, the trend in 
the respective markets and the profitability of the Volkswagen Group’s products."
"When 
determining cash flows for conducting impairment tests on companies or equity investments 
with new technology operations, it is of particular importance to assess whether these new 
technologies are technically feasible and have the potential for industrial use."
"With regard to the 
assumptions in the detailed planning period, reference is made to the above explanations in the 
subsection “Assumptions relating to the Volkswagen Group’s planning”."
"The Volkswagen 
Group’s estimation of cash flows is generally based on the expected growth trends for the 
markets concerned."
"The estimates for the cash flows following the end of the planning period 
are generally based on a growth rate of up to 1% p.a."
(up to 1% p.a.) at the Volkswagen Group.
"Under the “Road to 20” program, the Porsche Group has a long-term 
profitability target of achieving an operating return on sales of more than 20% for the group."
"· 
For MAN Truck & Bus, the year 2023 marked a turnaround, after the positive effects from the 
realignment program had not been fully leveraged because of the negative impacts of the war 
in Ukraine in the prior year."
"After a period of stabilization in 2024, the transformation towards 
e-mobility will, from the Volkswagen Group’s point of view, have an increasing effect on cash 
from the fiscal year 2025 onwards."
"· 
Moreover, Navistar Sales & Services is to be taken to new levels of strength."
"In addition, the recoverability of the lease assets depends in particular on the residual value of 
the leased vehicles after expiration of the lease term, because this represents a significant 
portion of the expected cash flows."
"The impairment tests performed at the level of Volkswagen have a potential impact not only on 
the original carrying amounts of the Volkswagen Group, but also on the hidden reserves 
identified in the course of the purchase price allocations conducted by Porsche SE."
"If there are no observable market inputs, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured using recognized valuation techniques, such 
as the relief-from-royalty method or the residual method."
"Impairment testing of financial assets requires estimates about the extent and probability of 
occurrence of future events."
"As far as possible, estimates are derived from experience taking 
into account current market data as well as rating categories and scoring information."
"Accounting for provisions is also based on estimates of the extent and probability of occurrence 
of future events, as well as estimates of the discount rate."
"As far as possible, these are also 
based on experience or external opinions."
"Calculation of the pension provisions is based on 
actuarial assumptions."
The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information obtained.
"The use of expected values invariably means that unused provisions are reversed or additional 
amounts have to be recognized for provisions."
"Warranty claims from sales transactions are 
calculated on the basis of losses to date, estimated future losses and the policy on ex gratia 
arrangements."
"In addition, assumptions must be made about the nature and extent of future 
warranty and ex gratia claims."
"For the provisions recognized in connection with the diesel issue, assumptions were made in 
particular for working hours, material costs and hourly wage rates, depending on the series, 
model year and country concerned."
"In addition, assumptions were made for future resale prices 
of repurchased vehicles."
"These assumptions are based on qualified estimates, which are based 
in turn on external data, and also reflect additional information available internally, such as 
values derived from past experience."
"For further information on litigation and the legal risks 
associated with the diesel issue at the Volkswagen Group, see subsection “Litigation and diesel 
issue” above."
"At the level of the Volkswagen Group, tax provisions were recognized for potential future tax 
backpayments, while other provisions were recognized for ancillary tax payments arising in this 
connection."

Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries have operations worldwide and are audited by local tax 
authorities on an ongoing basis."
"Amendments to tax laws and changes in legal precedent and 
their interpretation by the tax authorities in the respective countries may lead to tax payments 
that differ from the estimates made in the financial statements."
"The measurement of the tax 
provision is based on the most likely exposure resulting from this risk materializing."
"Volkswagen 
decides whether to account for multiple tax uncertainties separately or in groups on the merits 
of each individual case considered, depending on which type of presentation is better suited to 
predicting the extent to which the tax risk will materialize."
"In these cases, prices – including for tax 
purposes – are determined on the basis of standardized, generally accepted valuation 
techniques."
"If actual developments differ from the assumptions made by Volkswagen for recognizing the 
provisions, the figures actually recorded may differ compared to the estimates expected 
originally."
"Government grants are recognized based on an assessment as to whether there is reasonable 
assurance that the Volkswagen Group companies will fulfill the conditions for awarding the 
grants and that the grants will in fact be awarded."
"This assessment is based on the nature of the 
legal entitlement and past experience."
"Estimates of the useful life of finite-lived assets are based on experience and are reviewed 
regularly."
"Where estimates are modified the residual useful life is adjusted and an impairment 
loss is recognized, if necessary."
"As part of this review, the useful lives of certain items of 
property, plant and equipment were reassessed and extended in January 2023 at the level of the 
Volkswagen Group."
"These adjustments had a positive effect on the operating result in an 
amount of around €1.4 billion in 2023 (of which €92 million relates to the Porsche AG Group)."
"For 2024, the Volkswagen Group expects a positive effect of around €0.8 billion (of which 
around €1.6 million relates to the Porsche AG Group)."
"Estimates of lease terms under IFRS 16 are based on the non-cancelable period of a lease and 
an assessment of whether existing extension and termination options will be exercised."
"The 
determination of the lease term and the discount rates used impacts on the amounts to be 
recognized for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities."
"Measuring deferred tax assets requires assumptions regarding future taxable income and the 
timing of the realization of deferred tax assets."

Changes to underlying premises 
The estimates and assumptions are based on premises that are derived from the current 
information available."
"In particular, the circumstances given when preparing the consolidated 
financial statements as to the realistic expectations of future development of the global and 
industry-specific environment were used to estimate the company’s future business 
performance."
"Estimates and assumptions remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
because future business developments are subject to uncertainties that in part cannot be 
influenced by the Volkswagen Group including Porsche AG and its subsidiaries and in particular 
by the Porsche SE Group."
"This applies in particular to short and medium-term forecast cash 
flows as well as the discount rates used."
"Furthermore, at the level of Porsche SE, in particular the outcome of litigation may cause 
variances from expectations."
"In cases where the actual development differs from the original expectation, the premises, and if 
necessary the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities concerned, will be adjusted 
accordingly."
"Prior to the date of authorization for issue of the consolidated financial statements 
by the board of management, there were no indications that the carrying amounts of the assets 
and liabilities presented in the consolidated balance sheet would require any significant 
adjustment."

"As a result, 
the shares in Isar Aerospace have since been accounted for at equity (see notes [5] and [12])."
"These preference shares have been traded on the regulated market of the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange since 29 September 2022."
"Since the end of the stabilization period on 
11 October 2022, the free float of the preferred shares has been 24.2% of the preference share 
capital of Porsche AG."
"The remaining shares of the preference share capital of Porsche AG 
continue to be held by Volkswagen Group companies."
"The ordinary shares of Porsche AG are 
not listed."
"The basis for the IPO was a comprehensive agreement to enter into a number of contracts 
between Volkswagen and Porsche SE."
"In this context, the two parties agreed that Porsche SE 
would acquire 25% plus one share of the ordinary shares (around 12.5% of share capital) of 
Porsche AG from Volkswagen."
"The total price for 25% plus one share of Porsche AG’s ordinary 
shares amounted to €10.1 billion applying a premium of 7.5% on the placement price of the 
preference shares."
"The remaining shares of Porsche AG’s ordinary share capital continue to be 
held by Volkswagen Group companies."
"Under the share purchase agreement, Volkswagen AG 
as warrantor provided several warranties to Porsche SE, which essentially puts Porsche SE in 
the same position as buyers of the preference shares sold under the IPO."
"In addition, 
Volkswagen AG assumed a small number of other standard market guarantees, most of them 
limited to positive knowledge of Volkswagen AG."
Porsche SE acquired the ordinary shares in two tranches.
"Closing of the transfer of the first 
tranche of the ordinary shares was completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2022."
"The 
material transfer of the second tranche of ordinary shares took place as of the end of the fiscal 
year 2022, granting a lien on the ordinary shares of the second tranche to secure Volkswagen’s 
remaining purchase price receivable."
"As of 31 December 2022, Porsche SE thus had a purchase 
price obligation in an amount of €3.0 billion."

At the same time, Porsche SE had a dividend claim of €3.1 billion on the basis of the resolution 
of the extraordinary general meeting of Volkswagen AG on 16 December 2022."
"Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE agreed to offset Porsche SE’s dividend claim against 
Volkswagen AG with Porsche SE’s remaining purchase price obligation."
"In the consolidated 
financial statements as of 31 December 2022, the dividend receivable and the purchase price 
liability were therefore presented on a net basis."
"Upon payment of the special dividend on 
9 January 2023, the set-off process was completed and the lien on the ordinary shares of the 
second tranche granted in connection with the transfer of the second tranche expired."
"The 
IPO of Porsche AG and the acquisition of ordinary shares by Porsche SE also affected the 
carrying amount of the investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity."
"These effects are 
presented in notes [4] and [7]."
"Upon fulfillment of all closing 
conditions on 6 January 2022, all shares in PTV were transferred to a subsidiary of ETS, effective 
31 January 2022."
"At the same time, Porsche SE for its part acquired a 40% stake in ETS."
"The 
purchase price for the acquisition of these shares was paid in a non-cash transaction by 
transferring part of the purchase price receivable from the sale of the shares in PTV."
"The 
consideration received amounted to €0.3 billion."
"As a result of this partnership, Porsche SE sees 
a further significant increase in the potential for value development at PTV and hopes to 
participate in this through the remaining indirect share in the company."
"Due to the sale of shares in PTV, Porsche SE has classified the PTV Group as a discontinued 
operation as defined by IFRS 5 since 30 September 2021."
"Fulfilling the closing conditions on 
6 January 2022 resulted in a loss of control and therefore the deconsolidation of PTV."
"This 
resulted in a disposal of assets and liabilities of €0.3 billion and €0.1 billion, respectively, and a 
deconsolidation gain of around €0.1 billion was recorded in the result from discontinued 
operations."
"The shares in ETS were recognized at acquisition cost of around €77 million and ETS has since 
been included in the consolidated financial statements of Porsche SE as an associate in 
accordance with the equity method using the initial ownership interest of around 40%."

At the beginning of June 2022, the indirect acquisition of all shares in Econolite Group, Inc., 
Anaheim, USA (“Econolite”), was completed by ETS."
"To finance the purchase price, Porsche SE 
participated in a capital increase with an amount of around €35 million."
"In turn, the previous 
owners of Econolite acquired a non-controlling interest in ETS of around 10%, reducing  
Porsche SE’s stake in ETS through a dilution gain of around €1 million to around 35.5%."
"Preference shares of Volkswagen AG 
 
In the period from 29 March 2022 to 6 May 2022, Porsche SE acquired a total of 1.3%, or 
around 2.6 million, of the preference shares in Volkswagen AG for €400 million via the capital 
market."
This represents a capital share of around 0.5%.
"This increased Porsche SE’s 
shareholding in Volkswagen AG to 31.9% of subscribed capital."
"Porsche SE’s shareholding in 
the ordinary shares in Volkswagen AG remains unchanged at 53.3%."
"As a financing component for the acquisition of ordinary shares in Porsche AG, in June 2022 the 
supervisory board of Porsche SE approved a disposal plan for the 2.7 million preference shares 
in Volkswagen AG in total."
"As a result, the preference shares were reported as assets classified 
as held for sale pursuant to IFRS 5."
"As a result, the preference shares 
were therefore no longer classified as assets held for sale in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
2023 (see note [1], section “Changes to the prior-year period)."
"Reference 
is made to the explanations in note [1], in the section “Changes to the prior-year period”."
2 Prior-year figures were adjusted due to the first-time application of IFRS 17.

"Reference is made to the explanations in note [1],

"As 
Volkswagen AG was already an associate of Porsche SE at that time, this intercompany profit 
had to be eliminated."
"This reduced the carrying amount of the investment in Volkswagen AG 
tranche 1 accounted for at equity in the consolidated financial statements of Porsche SE; 
directly before the IPO of Porsche AG in the prior year, this eliminated intercompany profit 
amounted to €1,465 million."
"The sale of preference shares of Porsche AG by Volkswagen to third 
parties in the course of the IPO in the prior year equivalent to a capital share of 12.1% triggered 
the proportionate realization of the intercompany profit of €177 million (see note [7])."
"Since then, 
the remaining intercompany profit reducing the carrying amount of the investment in Volkswagen 
AG accounted for at equity amounts to €1,288 million."
"At the level of the Porsche SE Group, this 
was also accounted for without an effect on profit or loss."
"Note [12] contains further information on the development of the carrying amount accounted for 
at equity."
"Disclosures on the impairment test of the investments in Volkswagen AG accounted for

the investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity of €50,670 million (€48,232 million) 
exceeds the pro rata market capitalization of €18,948 million (€23,558 million), an impairment 
test was performed as of 31 December 2023."
"The impairment test regarding the investment in Volkswagen AG was performed by determining 
the value in use on the basis of a discounted cash flow method."
"As in the prior year, the calculation of the value in use was based on the current five-year plan 
prepared by the board of management of Volkswagen AG."
"With regard to 
the overall five-year planning period, the assumed average annual revenue growth, based on 
2023, is in the upper single-digit percentage range."
"The Volkswagen Group’s planning is based on the assumption that global economic output will 
grow overall in 2024 albeit at a slower pace."
"Volkswagen expects the persistently high inflation 
in many regions and the resulting restrictive monetary policy measures taken by central banks to 
have an increasingly adverse effect on consumer spending."
"From Volkswagen’s point of view, 
risks will continue to arise from protectionist tendencies, turbulence in the financial markets and 
structural deficits in individual countries."
"In addition, Volkswagen sees continuing geopolitical 
tensions and conflicts as weighing on growth prospects; risks are associated in particular with 
the Russia-Ukraine war and the confrontations in the Middle East."
"Nevertheless, Volkswagen 
assumes that both the advanced economies and the emerging markets will show positive 
momentum on average, albeit with below-average growth in gross domestic product."
"Volkswagen also expects the global economy to recover in 2025 and continue a path of stable 
growth until 2028."

Trends for the automotive markets in the individual regions are expected to be mixed but 
predominantly positive in 2024."
"Overall, the global volume of new car sales is expected to be 
slightly higher than in the reporting year."
"Growing demand is forecast for passenger cars 
worldwide in the period from 2025 to 2028."
"In the planning period, the planned automotive investment ratio is above the level of the long-
term target ratio of around 9% of revenue."
"It is assumed that the operating return on sales will 
develop positively over the planning years, in line with the Volkswagen Group’s long-term target 
of an operating return on sales of between 9% and 11% by 2030."
"For further estimates and assumptions based on the planning of the Volkswagen Group, 
reference is made to the section “Accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions of the 
management at the level of the Volkswagen Group” in note [2]."
"An annual growth rate of 1.0% (1.0%) was used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the 
detailed planning period."
"The sustainable operating return on sales of 9% is based on the lower 
end of the Volkswagen Group’s long-term target."
"For the investment in Volkswagen AG, a 
weighted average cost of capital of 10.2% (8.5%) or an pre-tax capital cost rate of 14.4% 
(11.9%) was used to discount the cash flows."
"This was derived using a peer group analysis and 
thus reflects a risk-adequate return on capital customary in the industry."
"To take into account the 
share of equity of Porsche AG not attributable to Volkswagen AG of 25%, the value of equity of 
Volkswagen AG was reduced accordingly."
The impairment test included a sensitivity analysis of the critical assumptions.
"The value in use determined in the impairment test is higher than the carrying amount of the 
investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity."
"The sensitivity analysis also yielded a 
value in use that was higher than the carrying amount in all of the scenarios considered."
"As a 
result, there was no need to recognize an impairment loss as of 31 December 2023, as was also 
the case in the prior year."

"Disclosures on the impairment test of the investments in Porsche AG accounted for at equity 
The ordinary shares of Porsche AG held by Porsche SE are not listed."
"Applying the stock price of 
the preference shares of Porsche AG plus an ordinary share premium of 7.5% would result in a 
proportionate value of Porsche SE’s investment in Porsche AG of €9,781 million (€11,599 million) 
as of 31 December 2023."
"The ordinary share premium is derived from the acquisition of ordinary 
shares of Porsche AG by Porsche SE."
"As the carrying amount of the investment in Porsche AG 
accounted for at equity of €10,423 million (€10,196 million) exceeds the derived pro rata value of 
the investment in Porsche AG of €9,781 million (€11,599 million), an impairment test was 
performed as of 31 December 2023."

"The calculation of the value in use was based on the current five-year plan prepared by the 
board of management of Porsche AG."
"With regard to the overall five-year planning 
period, the assumed average annual revenue growth, based on 2023, is in the upper single-digit 
percentage range."
"The Porsche AG Group’s planning is based on the assumption that average global economic 
output will continue to grow in 2024, albeit at a lower level than in the reporting year."
"This is 
provided that geopolitical conflicts and tensions with global repercussions do not intensify any 
further."
"The Porsche AG Group expects that global demand for passenger cars will develop 
differently from one region to another but, with the intensity of competition increasing, growth 
will be slightly higher overall than the level of the reporting year."
"In China, however, the Porsche AG 
Group continues to expect challenging market conditions, which the Porsche AG Group will 
counter by balancing market distribution across all sales regions and aligning supply and 
demand."
"It is assumed that the operating return on sales will develop positively over the planning years, in 
line with the Porsche AG Group’s long-term target of an operating return on sales of 20%."
"For further estimates and assumptions based on the planning of the Porsche AG Group, 
reference is made to the section “Accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions of the 
management at the level of the Volkswagen Group” in note [2]."
"An annual growth rate of 2.0% was used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the detailed 
planning period."
"The sustainable operating return on sales of 20% is based on the Porsche AG 
Group’s long-term target."
"For the investment in Porsche AG, a weighted average cost of capital 
of 8.9% or an pre-tax capital cost rate of 11.7% was used to discount the cash flows."
"This was 
derived using a peer group analysis and thus reflects a risk-adequate return on capital 
customary in the industry."
The impairment test included a sensitivity analysis of the critical assumptions.
"The value in use determined in the impairment test is significantly higher than the carrying amount 
of the investment in Porsche AG accounted for at equity."
"The sensitivity analysis also yielded a 
value in use that was higher than the carrying amount in all of the scenarios considered."
"As a 
result, there was no need to recognize an impairment loss as of 31 December 2023, as was also 
the case in the prior year."
"With regard to the investments in ETS accounted for at equity, there were no indications of 
impairment as of 31 December 2023."
"Reference 
is made to the explanations in note [1], in the section “Changes to the prior-year period” and in note [4]."
2 Prior-year figures were adjusted due to the first-time application of IFRS 17.
"Reference is made to the explanations in note [1], 
in the section “Changes to the prior-year period”."
"With regard to further information pursuant to IFRS 12 and explanations on the impairment tests 
for the investments accounted for at equity, reference is made to note [4]."
"Result from the investments in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity 
The result from ongoing at equity accounting results from the development in earnings at the 
level of the Volkswagen Group."
"The increase in the Volkswagen Group’s result is based on an 
increase in the operating result and the financial result as well as a simultaneous reduction in the 
income tax expense."
"These factors were offset in particular by increased product costs (for raw 
materials in particular) and exchange rate effects."
"In addition, the result of the Volkswagen 
Group was adversely impacted by negative effects from the fair value measurement of 
derivatives to which hedge accounting is not applied, especially commodity hedges."
"In the prior-
year period, these effects had a positive impact and were also reinforced by positive effects 
from derivatives in the financial services division."
"The financial result of the Volkswagen Group increased compared to the prior year mainly as a 
result of lower non-cash expenses from adjustments to the carrying amounts of investments due 
to changes in share prices and impairment tests as well as positive net income from securities 
and funds."
"Please refer to the explanations presented in the section “Results of operations of 
the Volkswagen Group” in the combined group management report."
"These were recognized in an ancillary calculation at the carrying amount accounted 
for at equity and are included in the effects from purchase price allocations in a total amount of 
€232 million."
"In the prior year, Porsche SE acquired a total of 1.3%, or around 2.6 million, of the preference 
shares in Volkswagen AG for €400 million via the capital market."
"This represents a capital share 
of around 0.5% (see note [3])."
"In the prior year, the acquisition resulted overall in income from 
first-time at equity accounting of €597 million as a result of a bargain purchase."
"With regard to the development in the result at the level of the Porsche AG Group, 
reference is made to the explanations presented in the section “Results of operations of the 
Porsche AG Group” in the combined group management report."
"The purchase price allocation for the acquisition of ordinary shares of Porsche AG, which was 
accounted for on a provisional basis in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 
2022, was finalized in the reporting year."
"The finalization of the purchase price allocation did not 
result in any material effects on the carrying amount of the investment as of 31 December 2022 
or on the subsequent accounting effects in the current reporting period."
"For further explanations 
on the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of ordinary shares of Porsche AG, reference 
is made to the explanations in note [1] of the consolidated financial statements of Porsche SE 
for the fiscal year 2022."
"In the fiscal year, an impairment loss of less than €1 million was recognized on the carrying 
amount of the investment in INRIX accounted for at equity (in the prior year reversal of 
impairment of €7 million)."
"[6] Income and expenses from investment valuation 
The items income and expenses from investment valuation contain the valuation effects from 
portfolio investments measured at fair value."
"Reference is made to note [21] for aggregated 
disclosures on the fair values of the financial instruments of the Porsche SE Group."
"[7] Other operating income 
Other operating income consists of:  
1 Prior-year figures were adjusted due to the retrospective application of IAS 28 for the preference shares of Volkswagen AG 
held by Porsche SE and previously classified pursuant to IFRS 5."
"Reference is made to the explanations in note [1], in the 
section “Changes to the prior-year period” and in note [4]."
"Other operating income includes income of €218 million from the recognition of a contractual 
claim for compensation against Volkswagen AG."
"This results from a compensation mechanism 
in the contribution agreement, based on tax benefits and tax disadvantages, in connection with 
the contribution of the holding business operations of Porsche SE to Volkswagen AG in the 
fiscal year 2012 (see note [23])."
"In the prior year, €177 million of other operating income related to the proportionate realization 
of an intercompany profit that was eliminated in the fiscal year 2012."
"The 
sale of preference shares of Porsche AG by Volkswagen to third parties in the course of the IPO 
of Porsche AG triggered the proportionate realization of the intercompany profit in the prior year 
(see note [4], section “Investments in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity”)."

"Using the effective interest method results in an interest expense of €320 million (€47 million) for 
financial liabilities."
"The interest result from hedging instruments (hedge accounting) consists, on the one hand, of 
accrued interest from interest rate hedging instruments in place in the fiscal year 2023 to which 
hedge accounting is applied."
"The interest result from hedging instruments (hedge accounting) consists of expenses 
of €4 million (€17 million) and income of €37 million (€0 million)."
"Other finance costs primarily 
contain commitment fees of €3 million (€2 million)."
"Other financial result largely comprises interest income from fixed-term deposits and securities 
classified as current assets of €24 million (€3 million)."
"In the prior year this also included positive 
effects of €13 million from the measurement of interest rate derivatives to which hedge 
accounting was not applied."
"Reference 
is made to the explanations in note [1], in the section “Changes to the prior-year period”."
"The current tax income recognized in the reporting year is largely due to the reversal of 
provisions for income taxes for 2009 and an income tax receivable for 2022 due to the tax loss 
carryback from 2023."
This was counterbalanced by a deferred tax expense (net).
"This is mainly due to the higher year-
on-year carrying amount of the investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity and the 
resulting higher deferred tax expense."
"In the reporting year, deferred tax liabilities on the higher 
carrying amount of the investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity were recognized in 
profit or loss in line with the share of the result from investments accounted for at equity 
recognized in the consolidated income statement."
"Tax losses which have been unused so far and for which no deferred tax assets were recognized 
amounted to €1,320 million (€1,151 million) and do not lapse over time in their entirety."
"Reference 
is made to the explanations in note [1], in the section “Changes to the prior-year period”."
"The item “difference in tax base” mainly relates to the tax exemption or non-deductibility of 
dividend income and sales of investments in connection with the investments accounted for at 
equity."
"The reconciliation item “recognition and measurement of deferred tax” mainly results 
from deferred tax not recognized as of the reporting date on tax losses from the reporting year of 
minus €55 million."
"The effects in the reporting year relating to other periods are largely due to the 
claim for compensation against Volkswagen AG recognized through profit or loss of €67 million."
"Reference is made to the explanations in note [1], in the 
section “Changes to the prior-year period”."
"The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized through other comprehensive 
income can be found in the statement of comprehensive income."
"In the fiscal year, deferred tax 
liabilities of €0 million (€24 million) were recognized directly via equity."
"All other changes are 
recognized through profit or loss."

"In the fiscal year 2023, on the basis of the resolution of the annual general meeting on 10 May 
2023, Porsche SE received from Volkswagen AG a dividend of €1,393 million."
"In the prior year, 
Porsche SE obtained dividend claims against Volkswagen AG of €1,201 million on the basis of 
the resolution of the annual general meeting on 12 May 2022 and of €3,052 million on the basis 
of the resolution of the extraordinary general meeting on 16 December 2022."
"As a result of these 
dividend resolutions, the carrying amount of the investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at 
equity decreased by €1,393 million in the fiscal year 2023 and by a total of €4,253 million in the 
prior year."
"In the fiscal year 2023, on the basis of the resolution of the annual general meeting on 28 June 
2023, Porsche SE received from Porsche AG a dividend of €114 million, which reduced the 
carrying amount of the investment in Porsche AG accounted for at equity in the fiscal year 2023."
"In the prior year, Porsche SE did not receive any dividends from Porsche AG."
"The investments in portfolio companies accounted for at equity mainly include ETS, INRIX and, 
since the fiscal year 2023, Isar Aerospace (see explanations in note [3])."
"In the fiscal year 2023, an impairment loss of less than €1 million was recognized on the carrying 
amount of the investment in INRIX accounted for at equity (in the prior year reversal of

[13] Other financial assets 
 
 
Other portfolio investments increased primarily due to the acquisition of investments in portfolio 
companies."
"The decrease in the carrying amount of the non-current derivative financial instruments is mainly 
due to the settlement of interest rate hedging instruments in the course of refinancing (see note 
[21])."
"On the date of their settlement, the instruments concerned had a total positive market 
value of €96 million (excluding accrued interest)."
"The current derivative financial instruments relate to accrued interest of  
€10 million as of the reporting date."
"Sundry other financial assets primarily contain accrued interest from fixed-term deposits of  
€5 million (€1 million) as of the reporting date."
"In the prior year, it mainly comprised the special 
dividend receivable from Volkswagen AG of €22 million, which was settled on 9 January 2023."
"Subscribed capital 
Unchanged from the figure at the end of the prior year, Porsche SE’s subscribed capital totals 
€306.25 million and continues to be divided into 153,125,000 ordinary shares and 153,125,000 
non-voting preference shares which have been fully paid in."
"Each share represents a €1 notional 
amount of the subscribed capital."
"The preference shares carry an additional dividend of  
0.6 cents per share in the event of there being net profit available for distribution and a 
corresponding resolution on a distribution."
"Capital reserves 
The capital reserves contain additions from share premiums reduced by the transaction costs 
incurred."
"Retained earnings 
Retained earnings contain current profits and those earned by the group companies in prior 
years and not yet distributed as well as part of the changes in equity recognized on a pro rata 
basis as part of at equity accounting."
"Other reserves (OCI) 
Other reserves are divided into items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods 
(reclassifiable items) and items that are not to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent 
periods (non-reclassifiable items)."
"The non-reclassifiable items contain the cumulative actuarial losses of the Porsche SE Group 
from pensions of €2 million (prior year: gains of €1 million) as well as the corresponding deferred 
tax assets of €1 million (prior year: deferred tax liabilities of €0 million)."
"The reclassifiable items and the non-reclassifiable 
items of minus €14 million (minus €24 million) and €25 million (€18 million), respectively, also 
contain deferred taxes on the investment in associates."
"In the fiscal year, a net amount of €22 million (minus €12 million) resulting from the accumulated 
income from cash flow hedges and €129 million (€410 million) resulting from the accumulated 
expenses from investments accounted for at equity was transferred to profit or loss (recycling)."
"Proposal for the appropriation of profit 
The separate financial statements of Porsche SE as of 31 December 2023 in accordance with 
the German Commercial Code show a net profit of €1,441 million (€4,104 million)."
"With transfers 
of €658 million to retained earnings (€2,052 million), the net profit available for distribution 
amounts to €783 million (€2,052 million)."
"The board of management proposes a resolution for 
the distribution of a dividend of €2.554 per ordinary share and €2.560 per preference share, i.e., 
a total distribution of €783 million."
"Dividends paid out in the fiscal year 2023 amounted to €2.554 
(€2.554) per ordinary share and €2.560 (€2.560) per preference share, in total €783 million 
(€783 million)."
"Earnings per share  
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the share of the result of Porsche SE’s 
shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary and preference shares outstanding 
during the fiscal year."
"Taking into account the additional dividend for holders of preference shares results in a 
difference of 0.6 cents between the earnings per ordinary share and earnings per preference 
share."
"Since there were no transactions in 2023 and 2022 that had a dilutive effect on the 
number of shares, diluted earnings per share correspond to the basic earnings per share."
"Reference 
is made to the explanations in note [1], in the section “Changes to the prior-year period” and in note [4]."
"[15] Provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
The Porsche SE Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit plans."
"In the case of defined contribution plans, the company makes contributions to state or private 
pension schemes based on legal or contractual requirements, or on a voluntary basis."
"Once the 
contributions have been paid, there are no further obligations for the company."
"Contributions 
amount to €0 million (€0 million) and were recognized in profit or loss."
"Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for benefits in the form of 
retirement, invalidity and dependents’ benefits payable under pension plans."
"The direct and indirect obligations include both current pension 
obligations and future pension and retirement benefit obligations."
"Porsche SE also provides 
conversion models, where employees at Porsche SE can make their own contributions to 
establish an additional personal pension account."
"Actuarial assumptions 
Pension obligations are calculated using actuarial methods based on a discount rate of 3.3% 
(3.8%), career progress of 1.0% (0.5%) and turnover of 2.7% (3.0%) as well as a wage and 
salary increase of 3.0% that remained unchanged on the prior year."
"Due to the increase in long-
term inflation expectations, future pension increases were adjusted to 2.2% (2.0%)."
"The most 
recent 2018 G Heubeck mortality tables were used for the calculation."
"The discount rate and future salary increases were 
each increased/decreased by 0.5 percentage points and future pension increases and turnover 
each increased/decreased by 0.25 percentage points."
"The effects on the pension provisions 
ranged from minus €2 million to €3 million (minus €2 million to €2 million) in the reporting period."
The weighted average duration of pension obligations is 16 years (16 years).
"The cash outflow of 
pension provisions is expected to amount to €1 million (€1 million) within the next year, €5 million 
(€4 million) in a period of between one and five years and €27 million (€23 million) in a period of 
more than five years."
"[16] Other provisions 
 
 
The amount reported for provisions for costs of litigation represents the expected amount to be 
paid for all litigation in which Porsche SE is involved directly or indirectly."
"They have been set up 
at the amount of attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses (reference is made to the description of 
the litigation underlying these provisions in note [22])."
"The provision amounts and timing of the 
outflows are based on estimations that are continuously rolled forward and adjusted when 
needed."
"The cash outflow for all non-current other provisions is expected within a period of between one 
and five years."
"By contrast, non-current financial liabilities relate to the notional 
amounts less the transaction costs to be allocated using the effective interest method."
"In the reporting period, the following significant developments occurred in financial liabilities:  
In March 2023, Porsche SE successfully placed a Schuldschein loan of around €2.7 billion."
"The 
Schuldschein loan comprises eight tranches with terms of three, five, seven and ten years, each 
of which is subject to a fixed or variable interest rate."
"Of the total volume, €1.0 billion is subject 
to a term of three years, €1.4 billion to a term of five years, €0.2 billion to a term of seven years 
and €0.2 billion to a term of ten years."
"This was followed by two further bonds in June 2023: one bond with a 
volume of €500 million, a coupon of 4.125% and a term until September 2027 and another with 
a volume of €750 million, a coupon of 4.25% and a term until September 2030."
"In the prior year, bank financing totaled €7.1 billion."
"Of this amount, €3.9 billion related to a 
bridge loan with a term of up to two years, €3.0 billion to a bank loan with a term of five years 
and €0.2 billion to a bank loan with a term of three years."
"The bridge loan was presented as a 
current financial liability as of 31 December 2022 because, although Porsche SE had the 
unilateral option to extend the bridge loan by another year, the planning was based on the 
assumption that the extension option would not be exercised."
"In the fiscal year, the bridge loan 
was repaid in full using the proceeds from the Schuldschein loan, the first bond and also using 
the dividend payment from Volkswagen AG."
"The five-year bank loan was repaid from the total 
proceeds of €1,250 million raised from the issuance of the other two bonds."
"The variable bank loans and tranches of the Schuldschein loan are or were subject to variable 
interest rates based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) plus a margin."
"Cash inflow from operating activities is derived indirectly, starting from the result after tax."
"In the reporting year, cash inflow from 
operating activities primarily contains the total dividend inflows of €1,415 million received by 
Porsche SE from Volkswagen AG and the total dividend inflows of €114 million received by 
Porsche SE from Porsche AG."
"Porsche SE’s dividend claim against Volkswagen AG totaling  
€3,051 million was offset against the remaining purchase price liability for Porsche SE’s 
acquisition of ordinary shares in Porsche AG to Volkswagen of €3,030 million."
"No capital gains 
tax was deducted from these dividend inflows."
"In the prior year, the gross dividend of  
€1,201 million attributable to Porsche SE was initially subject to capital gains tax plus solidarity 
surcharge of 26.375% or €317 million and was only paid out in the amount of the net dividend of 
€884 million."
"The refund of the capital gains tax originally deducted from dividends received less 
income tax for the 2022 assessment period totaling €316 million in the reporting year is reported 
in “Income tax received”."
"In the reporting period, this 
was mainly offset by cash outflows of €248 million (€52 million) for interest paid including 
transaction costs in connection with financial liabilities (see note [17])."
"This was 
counterbalanced by cash received from the sale of the shares in PTV of €226 million less the 
cash and cash equivalents of the PTV Group of €25 million disposed of in the course of the 
deconsolidation."
"In the prior year, the cash inflow from 
financing activities was due in particular to raising debt capital for the purchase price payment 
of the ordinary shares of Porsche AG of €7,070 million (see note [17])."
"The statement of cash flows contains a total of €1 million (€1 million) for total cash outflows from 
leases, of which €1 million related to continuing operations in the prior year."
The investments of Porsche SE fall into two categories.
"The core 
investments category includes the long-term core investments in Volkswagen AG and in Porsche 
AG."
"In the portfolio investments category, the Porsche SE Group holds non-controlling interests 
in technology companies."
"Investments in private equity and venture capital funds are also 
allocated to this category."
"Usually, portfolio investments are held by Porsche SE for a temporary 
period of time and are typically characterized by their high potential for growth and for 
increasing value during the holding period."
"In both categories, the sector focus is on mobility 
and industrial technology and is to be supplemented by investments in related areas in the 
future."
"As chief operating decision maker, the board of management of Porsche SE uses the 
areas “core investments” and “portfolio investments” and their contribution to the result after tax 
as the basis for managing and allocating resources."
"Porsche SE’s holding operations, 
comprising Porsche SE’s corporate functions, including the holding financing function, are all 
allocated to the “core investments” for the purpose of managing resources."
"The segment reporting of Porsche SE is based on the internal management and reporting within 
the Porsche SE Group and, on the basis of the investment strategy, reports the two segments 
“core investments” and “portfolio investments”."
"Transactions between the segments, i.e., in 
particular intragroup financing transactions, are not managed separately and are therefore 
eliminated so that consolidated figures are always used for management purposes."
The methods mentioned in the section “Basis of presentation” apply to the segment reporting.

Reporting segments 2023: 
1 With the exception of financial instruments, deferred tax assets, assets from defined benefit plans and rights from 
insurance contracts."
"Please 
refer to the explanations in the section “Changes in the reporting period”."
2 Prior-year figures were adjusted due to the first-time application of IFRS 17.
"Please refer to the explanations in the section 
“Changes in the reporting period”."
"3 With the exception of financial instruments, deferred tax assets, assets from defined benefit plans and rights from 
insurance contracts."
"With regard to further information pursuant to IFRS 12 and explanations on the impairment tests 
for the investments accounted for at equity, reference is made to note [4]."
"In both the reporting year and the 
prior year, all non-current assets in the “core investments” segment are located/held entirely in 
Germany."
"The investments contained in the “portfolio investments” segment are based in North 
America, Europe and Israel."
"[20] Capital management 
The aim of capital management at Porsche SE is to maintain a robust financial profile so as to 
strengthen its financial flexibility and preserve its ability to act strategically."
"The focus here is on 
securing sufficient liquidity, a broad access to the capital market at attractive conditions and 
limiting financial risks."
"In order to ensure this, Porsche SE is currently aiming to further reduce its 
debt – subject to possible acquisitions – and continue to be geared towards an investment 
grade profile."
"For the purpose of capital management, Porsche SE can, among other things, 
make adjustments to the dividend payments to shareholders."
"Group net debt serves as a core 
management indicator in this respect."
"This comprises financial liabilities less cash and cash 
equivalents, time deposits and securities each as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
of Porsche SE."
Net debt of the Porsche SE Group corresponds to negative net liquidity.
"The 
terminology for the management indicator net liquidity was adjusted accordingly following the 
raising of debt capital in the prior year."
"The way in which the management indicator is 
determined is otherwise unchanged in the fiscal year 2023."
"Group net debt amounted to minus €5,717 million (€6,672 million) as of the reporting date."
"1 Prior-year figures were adjusted due to the retrospective application of IAS 28 for the preference shares of Volkswagen AG 
held by Porsche SE and previously classified pursuant to IFRS 5 and due to the first-time application of IFRS 17."
"Please 
refer to the explanations in the section “Changes in the reporting period”."
"Please refer to note [17] for the composition and development of financial liabilities as of the 
reporting date."
Porsche SE has an undrawn credit line of €1 billion with a term until 18 September 2026.
"The 
term can be extended by a further year until 18 September 2027 with the consent of the lending 
banks."
"These conditions and covenants, which are monitored by Porsche SE as part of its 
capital management, were all met in the reporting period."
"The financial covenants relate in 
particular to the market value of Porsche SE’s shares in Volkswagen AG and in Porsche AG as 
well as to the interest cover."
"The bank financing also includes conditions that link the amount of 
the dividend distributions of Porsche SE to its shareholders to the amount of the dividend 
distributions received by Porsche SE from its investments in Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG."
"This allows for both a rigorous reduction of financial liabilities as well as a continued appropriate 
profit participation of the shareholders of Porsche SE."
"If the conditions and financial covenants 
are breached, the lending banks and investors may call in the corresponding financial liabilities, 
regardless of the contractually agreed maturities."
"On the basis of the current financial planning, 
Porsche SE expects to continue to comply with the conditions and financial covenants."
"In order to hedge against interest rate changes, Porsche SE has entered into derivative hedging 
instruments (see note [21])."
"[21] Financial risk management and financial instruments 
1 Financial risk management principles 
The principles and responsibilities for managing the risks are generally defined by the board of 
management and monitored by the supervisory board."
"The same applies in particular to risks 
that could arise from financing activities and the use of financial instruments."
This also includes monitoring any concentrations of risk within the Porsche SE Group.
"The risks 
are identified, evaluated, managed, monitored and documented."
"The guidelines and the 
supporting systems are checked regularly and brought into line with current market 
developments."
"For further details on risk management and on risks relating to financing and the use of financial 
instruments, reference is made to the section “Opportunities and risks of future development” in 
Porsche SE’s combined group management report."
"Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, securities are invested and derivative financial 
instruments are entered into with different counterparties in Germany and abroad in order to 
spread the risk."
"At the Porsche SE Group, the expected credit loss model under IFRS 9 is generally applied 
consistently to all financial assets and other risk exposures."
"In particular, all financial assets 
measured at amortized cost are subject to the general approach provided there is no objective 
evidence of impairment upon initial recognition."
"The general approach divides the financial 
assets into three risk provisioning levels."
"Level 1 comprises financial assets that are recognized 
for the first time or do not show any significant increase in the probability of default."
"This level 
involves calculating anticipated bad debts for the next twelve months."
"Level 2 comprises 
financial assets that show a significant increase in the probability of default."
"Level 3 comprises 
financial assets that already show objective evidence of default."
"These two levels involve 
calculating anticipated bad debt for the entire term."
"At the Porsche SE Group, the impairment model pursuant to IFRS 9 applies to assets with a 
total carrying amount of €1,014 million (€449 million)."
"Financial assets measured at amortized cost at the Porsche SE Group largely comprise cash 
and cash equivalents, securities and time deposits."
"The time deposits have a weighted average 
original maturity of around four months."
"These financial instruments are allocated to risk 
provisioning level 1."
There are no significant impairment losses that need to be recognized.
"3 Liquidity risk 
The Porsche SE Group needs sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations."
"The solvency and liquidity of the Porsche SE Group is continuously monitored by means of 
liquidity planning."
"Solvency and liquidity are additionally secured by a cash liquidity reserve and 
an undrawn credit line."
"The undrawn credit line had a volume of €1 billion as of the reporting 
date."
"The cash outflows resulting from current financial liabilities within the next year 
as of the reporting date primarily relate to interest payments for bank loans, Schuldschein loans 
and bonds."
"The cash outflows resulting from non-current other financial liabilities within the next 
year as of the reporting date relate to payments from interest rate hedging instruments with 
negative fair values as of the reporting date, taking into account the EURIBOR interest curve."
"The 
accrued interest of €7 million related to these instruments is included in current other financial 
assets as of the reporting date and is therefore not included in the table above."
"Both the non-
current and current financial liabilities contain lease liabilities totaling €1 million (€1 million)."
"The cash outflows resulting from current financial liabilities within the next 1 to 5 years as of the 
prior year reporting date related to both interest and principal payments for the bridge loan."
"This 
was classified as a current financial liability due to its original term of 1 year and the planned 
repayment in full in the fiscal year 2023, which also occurred as expected (see note [17])."
"However, when determining the contractual term to assess the liquidity risk, it had to be taken 
into account that Porsche SE had the possibility to unilaterally extend the term of the bridge 
loan to a total of 2 years."
"The financing agreements are subject to conditions and financial covenants that are customary 
in the market."
"A breach of conditions and financial covenants can in principle lead to the 
outstanding financing volume falling due and therefore to liquidity risks."
"Such developments are 
not foreseeable at present and are considered to be unlikely."
"There are no significant concentrations of risk that are not evident from the notes to the financial 
statements and the combined group management report."
"4 Market risk 
The Porsche SE Group is exposed to interest rate, stock price and currency risks in the course 
of its general business activities."
"There are no significant concentrations of risk that are not 
evident from the notes to the financial statements and the combined group management report."
"The risk management 
strategy of Porsche SE aims to achieve a balanced reduction in uncertainty surrounding 
earnings and liquidity as a result of variable interest payments from borrowings."
"In the 
reporting year, Porsche SE’s interest rate risk changed in particular as a result of the refinancing 
of the bridge loan and the partial refinancing of the five-year bank loan (see note [17])."
"After these adjustments, there were interest rate swaps with a notional amount of  
€3.3 billion with an average fixed interest rate of around 2.86% and terms of up to around six 
years as of 31 December 2023."
"The interest rate swaps terminated in the fiscal year had positive 
market values at the time of their termination."
"Of these, €83 million (excluding accrued interest) 
related to interest rate swaps accounted for under hedge accounting and €13 million related to 
interest rate swaps to which hedge accounting is not applied."
"The hedging instruments and 
financing components of Porsche SE are based on the same hedged risk in the form of the 
EURIBOR interest rate risk."
"The interest rate hedging instruments are accounted for under 
hedge accounting pursuant to IFRS 9 in the form of cash flow hedges."
Interest rate risk within the meaning of IFRS 7 is determined using sensitivity analyses.
"The 
effects of the risk-variable market rates of interest on the financial result and on equity are 
presented, net of tax."
"If market interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of 
31 December 2023, equity would have been €72 million (€197 million) higher and the result after 
tax unchanged (€11 million higher)."
"If market interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as 
of 31 December 2023, equity would have been €75 million (€207 million) lower and the result 
after tax unchanged (€12 million lower)."
"4.1.2 Hedge accounting 
  
Disclosures on gains and losses from cash flow hedges  
 
Changes in deferred tax liabilities of minus €31 million (€39 million) were recognized as a result 
of the changes in the cash flow hedge reserve presented in the table."
"The gain or loss from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments used in hedge accounting 
corresponds to the basis for determining hedge ineffectiveness."
"The ineffective portion of a cash 
flow hedge is the income or expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument that exceed the changes in the fair value of the hedged item."
"This hedge 
ineffectiveness is attributable to differences in the parameters for the hedging instrument and 
the hedged item."
There were no cases of hedge ineffectiveness in the reporting year.
"There was 
an insignificant degree of ineffectiveness in the prior year, which was recognized in other 
financial result."
"Of these reclassifications, €4 million (€17 million) relates  
to expenses and €37 million (€0 million) to income."
"The summary below presents the remaining maturities of the notional amounts of the hedging 
instruments:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Notional 
Other 
Other 
Fair value 
Mio."
"The fair value of the hedging instruments is determined using market data as of the reporting 
date as well as appropriate valuation techniques."
"The 
notional amounts of the hedging instruments stated in the section above match the hedged 
notional amount components of the hedged items."
"Development of the cash flow hedge reserve 
Applying cash flow hedge accounting requires the designated effective changes in fair value  
of the hedging instruments to be recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve via other 
comprehensive income."
"They are reclassified to profit or loss in the case of hedges of variable-
interest financial liabilities at the times when the hedged future interest payments have an 
impact on the income statement; reclassifications are recognized in the financial result."
"This 
principle applies equally to the changes in value recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve of 
already discontinued hedging instruments that remain economically effective."
"They are 
reclassified to profit or loss over the shorter of the term of the follow-up financing and the 
remaining term of the hedging instrument upon termination."
"Any additional changes in the fair 
value of the designated or non-designated components are recognized in profit or loss as 
ineffectiveness."
"On this basis, a systematic compensating effect of hedged items and hedging 
instruments could be expected prospectively for all hedging relationships due to an economic 
relationship with respect to the hedged risk."
"Retrospective analysis of effectiveness or 
ineffectiveness uses a test for ineffectivities in the form of the dollar offset method."
"Under the 
dollar offset method, the changes in value of the hedged item expressed in monetary units are 
compared with the changes in value of the hedging instrument expressed in monetary units."
"In the case of interest rate hedges at Porsche SE, the critical terms match method gives rise to 
the expectation of prospective effectiveness of the hedges as of the reporting date."
"There was 
no ineffectiveness in the reporting year and no significant ineffectiveness in the prior year."
"Effects of the stock price risk on the result or on equity stem from investments whose equity 
instruments are listed."
"For portfolio investments whose equity instruments are listed, the share prices observable on 
the market are monitored and regularly marked to market."
"Changes in share prices fully affect 
the group result of Porsche SE as a result of accounting for equity instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss."
"If the stock price of the listed portfolio investments as of 31 December 2023 had been 10% 
higher, equity would have been €0 million (€0 million) higher and the result after tax €0 million  
(€0 million) higher."
"If the stock price of the listed portfolio investments as of 31 December 2023 
had been 10% lower, equity would have been €0 million (€0 million) lower and the result after tax 
€0 million (€0 million) lower."
"4.3 Foreign currency risk 
 
The Porsche SE Group is not exposed to any significant risks from exchange rate fluctuations in 
its operating activities."
"Reference 
is made to the explanations in note [1], in the section “Changes in the reporting period”."
"The allocation of fair value to the various levels is based on the availability of observable market 
data on an active market."
"Level 1 presents the fair values of financial instruments where a 
market price on active markets can be determined."
"Level 2 presents the fair value of financial 
instruments for which market data are directly or indirectly observable."
"In particular, the inputs 
used are yield curves or index and currency rates."
"The presented fair values of the assets are 
determined using pricing methods or present value methods."
"Fair values of financial instruments 
in level 3 are determined using inputs that are not based on observable market data."
"In the prior year, given their exclusively variable interest rate, the 
notional value of financial liabilities provided a reasonable approximation of their fair value."
"The 
carrying amount of current assets and current liabilities not measured at fair value through profit 
or loss provides a reasonable approximation of their fair value."
"Transfers between the levels are 
taken into account on the respective reporting dates."
"The remaining fair value (clean price) is 
recognized under non-current other financial assets or non-current other financial liabilities."
"The 
fair values of the interest rate swaps constitute level 2 fair values as their measurement is based 
on observable yield curves."
Non-current other financial assets also contain investments in portfolio companies.
"The fair 
value of these assets is based on stock prices, information derived from most recently 
performed financing measures or the discounted cash flow method."
There were no transfers between the levels in the reporting year and the prior year.
"In the prior year, this also included effects from the measurement of interest rate hedging 
instruments, which were no longer accounted for under hedge accounting following the 
elimination of the planned hedged item in the prior year."
"The measurements are recognized in 
the consolidated income statement under income/expenses from investment valuation or in 
other financial result (see note [10])."
"Net gains or losses from assets measured at fair value 
through profit or loss contain unrealized gains of €1 million (€24 million) and unrealized losses of 
€1 million (€11 million)."
"Porsche SE’s assessment of the actions 
pending as of 31 December 2023 is presented below."
"To date, provisions have been recorded 
for the expected legal fees and litigation expenses for all cases, but not for the underlying claims, 
as the likelihood of plaintiffs prevailing is estimated to be 50% or less."
"Due to the complexity of 
the underlying facts and legal issues, the financial extent of the amount in dispute is stated 
below."
"Subject of those actions were alleged damage claims based on alleged market 
manipulation and alleged inaccurate information in connection with Porsche SE’s increase of the 
investment in Volkswagen AG."
"In part these claims were also based on alleged violations of 
antitrust regulations."
"In the six initial proceedings suspended with reference to the model case, a 
total of 40 plaintiffs are asserting alleged claims for damages of about €5.4 billion (plus interest)."
"By decision of 30 September 2022, all of the establishment objectives requested by the plaintiffs 
were dismissed or declared groundless by the Higher Regional Court of Celle."
"The Higher 
Regional Court of Celle substantiates its decision on the opinion that Porsche SE cannot be 
deemed liable under any legal aspect and that the opposed pleading of the plaintiffs is 
inconclusive."
"With this decision, Porsche SE considers its legal position justified that the claims 
asserted in the suspended initial proceedings are without merit."
"The decision of the Higher 
Regional Court of Celle is not yet final."
"The plaintiffs filed an appeal against the decision with the 
Federal Court of Justice."
"In a proceeding pending before the Regional Court of Frankfurt against an incumbent and a 
former, meanwhile deceased, member of the supervisory board of Porsche SE, Porsche SE 
joined as intervener in support of the defendants."
"No new 
developments occurred in this proceeding during the reporting period."
"Porsche SE considers 
these claims to be without merit and sees itself justified in this legal position by the decision of 
the Higher Regional Court of Celle of 30 September 2022."
"Since 2012, Porsche SE and two companies of an investment fund have been in dispute over 
the existence of alleged claims in the amount of about US$195 million and have filed lawsuits in 
Germany and England respectively."
A final decision on this issue continues to be outstanding.
"Currently, the 
proceedings are pending before the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"On 21 December 2021, 
the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart decided that witnesses are to be interrogated in the 
United Kingdom by way of a request for mutual legal assistance."
"On 11 May 2023 one of the 
witnesses was interrogated by the Oxford County Court."
"The other witness referred to his right 
to refuse to testify pursuant to German law via the High Court."
"The Higher Regional Court of 
Stuttgart will decide whether or not the right to refuse to testify applies."
"Only thereafter, and only 
if the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart has decided that a right to refuse to testify does not 
apply, can the other witness be interrogated by the English courts."
"Porsche SE considers the 
action filed in England to be inadmissible and the asserted claims to be without merit."
"The 
plaintiffs accuse Porsche SE of alleged nonfeasance of capital market information or alleged 
incorrect capital market information in connection with the diesel issue."
"Some of these 
proceedings are directed against both Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG."
"Porsche SE considers 
the actions to be inadmissible in part, but in any case to be without merit."
Before the Regional Court of Stuttgart 209 actions are currently pending at first instance.
"The 
actions pending at first instance concern payment of damages, if quantified, in the total amount 
of approximately €797 million (plus interest) and in part establishment of liability for damages."
"Proceedings at first instance, with a total amount of approximately  
€80.9 million (plus interest), are currently suspended, whereby the majority of the suspended 
proceedings are suspended with reference to a KapMuG proceeding meanwhile pending before 
the Federal Court of Justice."
"Porsche SE considers the actions filed against it before the 
Regional Court of Stuttgart to be without merit."
"The actions filed against Porsche SE before the 
Regional Court of Braunschweig are considered by Porsche SE to be inadmissible and without 
merit."
"In addition, two further proceedings, in which a total of a further approximately €129 million (plus 
interest) in damages was claimed, are pending before the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart on 
appeal."
"In one of the appeal proceedings in which approximately €5.7 million (plus interest) in 
damages was claimed, the Regional Court of Stuttgart had granted the action in the amount of 
approximately €3.2 million (plus interest) and otherwise dismissed the action on 24 October 
2018."
Porsche SE and the plaintiff filed appeals.
"The proceeding has been suspended in the 
meanwhile with reference to a KapMuG proceeding pending before the Federal Court of Justice."
"In the further proceeding, which is partly on appeal, plaintiffs object to the fact that the Regional 
Court of Stuttgart dismissed their actions as inadmissible on 26 August 2021."
"The amount in

dispute is approximately €123 million (plus interest)."
"Porsche SE considers these actions 
pending against it before the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart to be without merit."
"A KapMuG proceeding, initiated by order for reference of the Regional Court of Stuttgart of 
28 February 2017, was pending before the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"On 22 October 
2020, the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart appointed a model case plaintiff."
"Several hearings 
have taken place before the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"The Higher Regional Court of 
Stuttgart expanded the model case with further establishment objectives."
"During the hearing of 
7 December 2022, the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart interrogated two former members of 
the board of management of Porsche SE as witnesses."
"Both witnesses stated individually to 
have heard of the diesel issue for the first time in September 2015 through press reporting."
"In its 
model case ruling of 29 March 2023, the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart found that, in 
principle, an ad hoc disclosure obligation of Porsche SE can also exist with respect to 
circumstances at Volkswagen AG."
"If there is a specific reason 
for doing so, the board of management has a duty to make specific inquiries."
"With regard to any 
knowledge of the board of management of Porsche SE or breach of duty, the plaintiffs have the 
burden of proof."
"The Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart also ruled that any knowledge of 
confidential circumstances at Volkswagen AG of board members of Volkswagen AG who are 
also members of the board of management of Porsche SE cannot be attributed to Porsche SE."
"In addition, the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart ruled that any knowledge of circumstances at 
Volkswagen AG on the level below the board of management of Volkswagen AG cannot be 
attributed to Porsche SE."
"Finally, the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart ruled that the members 
of the board of management of Porsche SE at the time, Dr. Wendelin Wiedeking and Holger P
."
"Härter, had no knowledge of the diesel issue and such missing knowledge was also not based 
on gross negligence on their side."
"The establishment objectives sought by the plaintiffs against 
Porsche SE were therefore overwhelmingly not made by the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart."
"On the basis of the establishment objectives made in the model case ruling and the current 
status of the matter in dispute in the initial proceedings, all investor claims against Porsche SE in 
the suspended initial proceedings would, as a result, have to be dismissed."
"The model case 
ruling is not yet final."
"The model case plaintiff, several plaintiffs and Porsche SE have filed an 
appeal on points of law against the model case ruling."
"Following corresponding orders to suspend the proceedings by the Regional Court of 
Braunschweig and the courts of Stuttgart, Porsche SE became a further model case defendant 
in the model case proceedings before the Higher Regional Court of Braunschweig."
"The Higher 
Regional Court of Braunschweig issued a binding partial model case ruling regarding questions 
of jurisdiction."
"Several hearings have taken place before the Higher Regional Court of 
Braunschweig."
"On 7 July 2023 the Higher Regional Court of Braunschweig issued an order to 
take evidence and requested numerous persons to be interrogated and documents to be 
produced and submitted."
"The interrogations commenced in the autumn of 2023 and will be 
resumed."
"The plaintiffs claim to be shareholders of Volkswagen AG and allege claims of 
Volkswagen AG on its behalf."
"The action is based, inter alia, on an alleged violation of duties vis-
à-vis Volkswagen AG pursuant to the AktG [“Aktiengesetz”: German Stock Corporation Act] and 
the German Corporate Governance Code (Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex – DCGK)."
"The plaintiffs request, inter alia, a declaration that the defendants have breached their respective 
duties vis-à-vis Volkswagen AG, and an award to Volkswagen AG as compensation for the 
alleged damages it sustained as a result of the alleged violation of duties, plus interest."
"In 
September 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, which is subject to court approval, accepting 
service on behalf of certain defendants including Porsche SE, staying all discovery and setting a 
motion to dismiss briefing schedule."
"Pursuant to a consortium 
agreement, the Porsche and Piëch families have control of the parent company Porsche SE."
"The disclosure requirements under IAS 24 also extend to persons who have the power to 
exercise significant influence over the entity, i.e., who have the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policies of the entity, but do not control it."
"In the fiscal year 2023 and in 
the comparative period, this concerns members of the supervisory board and the board of 
management of Porsche SE as well as their close family members."
"The disclosure requirements pursuant to IAS 24 also include persons and entities over which  
the Porsche SE Group can exercise a significant influence."
"In the reporting period and the 
comparative period, related parties included the associates as well as their subsidiaries and 
therefore in particular Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries including Porsche AG and its 
subsidiaries."
"Supplies and services received and other expenses in the reporting period mainly 
consisted of services as well as the provision of vehicles."
"In the prior year, liabilities mainly 
comprised obligations in connection with the contribution of the holding business operations of 
Porsche SE to Volkswagen AG in the fiscal year 2012."
"Dividends 
 
On the basis of the resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of Volkswagen AG on 
16 December 2022, there was a special dividend claim against Volkswagen of €3,052 million  
as of 31 December 2022."
"Upon payment of the special dividend 
on 9 January 2023, the set-off process was completed."
"No capital gains tax was withheld for the dividends received in 
the fiscal year (in the prior year capital gains tax plus solidarity surcharge of €317 million was 
withheld)."
"The dividend of €114 million received from Porsche AG of on 3 July 2023, based on the 
resolution by the annual general meeting of Porsche AG on 28 June 2023, is also not included in 
the table above."
No capital gains tax was withheld for the dividends received in the fiscal year.
"In 
the prior year, Porsche SE did not receive any dividends from Porsche AG."
"In addition, Volkswagen AG has undertaken to hold the Deposit 
Protection Fund harmless from any losses incurred as a result of its actions in favor of a 
majority-owned bank."
"· 
During the assessment periods 2006 to 2009, Porsche SE was initially the legal successor of 
Porsche AG and later the ultimate tax parent and thus liable for tax payments."
"In the course of 
the contribution of the business operations in the fiscal year 2012, the tax obligations of 
Porsche SE and its subsidiaries for the period to until 31 July 2009 were not transferred to 
Volkswagen AG."
"In return, Volkswagen AG has undertaken to 
reimburse Porsche SE for any tax advantages of Porsche Holding Stuttgart GmbH, Porsche 
AG and their legal predecessors and subsidiaries relating to tax assessment periods up to 
31 July 2009."
"The amount of tax benefits and tax disadvantages to be taken into account is 
regulated in the contribution agreement."
"It was therefore not possible to reasonably determine 
any potential compensation claim until the tax field audit of Porsche AG for the 2009 
assessment period had been completed."
"After the tax field audit of Porsche AG for the 
assessment period 2009 was substantively completed in the third quarter of 2023, the findings 
of the tax field audit of Porsche AG were accepted by Porsche SE which is liable for the tax 
payments as the former ultimate tax parent."
"The table above contains the corresponding income of Porsche SE of €218 million in the 
fiscal year 2023."
"Within the scope of the comprehensive agreement, Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG had 
granted each other put and call options relating to the 50.1% share in Porsche Holding Stuttgart 
GmbH remaining at Porsche SE prior to the contribution of its holding business operations to 
Volkswagen AG."
"Also in that event, too, 
Porsche SE has a payment claim against Volkswagen AG in the amount of the present value of 
the recoverable tax benefits resulting from such a transaction at the level of Volkswagen AG or 
one of its subsidiaries."
"Accordingly, Volkswagen 
AG holds Porsche SE harmless for half the amount of such tax incurred there."

provided several warranties to Porsche SE, which essentially puts Porsche SE in the same 
position as buyers of the preference shares sold in the IPO."
"In addition, Volkswagen AG 
assumes a small number of other standard market guarantees, most of them limited to positive 
knowledge of Volkswagen AG."
"Transactions with portfolio investments

In the following, we present the key audit matters from our point of view: 
❶ 
 
Valuation of the investment in Volkswagen AG (incl."
"The investment in Volkswagen AG therefore represents the most 
significant asset of Porsche SE and, as it is accounted for using the equity method, has a 
significant influence on the results of operations and net assets of the Porsche SE Group through 
the profit/loss attributable to Porsche SE."
"The provisions for risks in 
connection with the diesel issue recognized in the consolidated financial statements of 
Volkswagen AG as at 31 December 2023 are based on the knowledge of the executive directors 
of Volkswagen AG as presented therein."
"In the event of a sustained decline in earnings due to unexpected additional burdens 
to deal with the diesel issue, the investment in Volkswagen AG may be impaired."
"We involved our valuation specialists in the audit for the methodological and 
mathematical assessment of the valuation model and the calculation parameters applied."
"Furthermore, we assessed the corporate planning approved by the board of management and 
supervisory board of Volkswagen AG and compared key planning assumptions with external 
analysts' estimates."
"In addition, we compared the planning prepared in previous periods with 
the results that actually materialized in order to assess the accuracy of the business plans."
"We 
also assessed the derivation of the risk-adjusted capitalization rate, in particular by assessing 
the peer group, comparing the market data used with external evidence and verifying the 
mathematical accuracy."
"We assessed the company's sensitivity analyses in order to be able to 
estimate an impairment risk in the event of a possible change in one of the key assumptions."
"For this purpose, we issued 
audit instructions to the auditor of the consolidated financial statements of Volkswagen AG in 
which we provided guidance on risk classification and the audit approach, in particular in 
connection with risks relating to the diesel issue."
"In addition, we regularly obtained information 
on the current status of the audit in personal meetings and reviewed the working papers of the 
auditor of the consolidated financial statements."
"Furthermore, we assessed the retrospective 
application of IAS 28 to the preference shares in Volkswagen AG held by Porsche SE, which 
were recognized in accordance with IFRS 5 in the prior year."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of Volkswagen AG 
(incl."
the effects of the diesel issue on the valuation of the investment in Volkswagen AG).
"❷ 
 
Valuation of the investment in Porsche AG 
① 
 
Risk for the consolidated financial statements 
The share in the associate Porsche AG of €10.4 billion (17% of total assets) is reported in the 
company's consolidated financial statements under “Investments accounted for at equity”."
"The 
investment in Porsche AG represents a significant asset of Porsche SE and, as it is accounted 
for using the equity method, influences the results of operations, financial position and net 
assets of the Porsche SE Group through the profit/loss attributable to Porsche SE on a pro rata 
basis."
"As part of a purchase price allocation, the cost of the investment was offset against the 
proportionate assets and liabilities recognized in the carrying amount of the investment 
accounted for at equity in a secondary calculation."
"Porsche SE consulted an external expert to 
perform the purchase price allocation."
"The purchase price allocation for the acquisition of the 
ordinary shares in Porsche AG to be performed for the purposes of inclusion using the equity 
method had not yet been completed as of 31 December 2022, meaning that the purchase price 
allocation was finalized in 2023."
"Against this background, this 
matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit."
"②  
Audit approach 
First, we assessed the classification of Porsche AG as an associate in the consolidated financial 
statements of Porsche SE and obtained an understanding of the preliminary purchase price 
allocation as of 31 December 2022."
"In addition, we assessed the appropriateness of the 
purchase price allocation finalized in 2023 in the course of the at-equity valuation, the 
significant assumptions and the valuation methods."
"Finally, we assessed whether the 
disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on the finalization of the 
purchase price allocation comply with the requirements of IFRS."
"As part of our audit, we 
analyzed the underlying process and its suitability for assessing the recoverability of the 
investment in the investee in order to assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of the 
investment in Porsche AG performed by the executive directors of Porsche SE."
"We involved our 
valuation specialists in the audit for the methodological and mathematical assessment of the 
valuation model and the calculation parameters applied."
"We also satisfied 
ourselves that the planning data relevant to the Porsche AG Group were comprehensibly 
included in the approved corporate planning of Volkswagen AG."
"In addition, we compared the 
business plans prepared in prior periods with the results actually realized in order to assess the 
accuracy of the business plans."
"We also assessed the derivation of the risk-adjusted 
capitalization rate, in particular by questioning the peer group, comparing the market data used 
with external evidence and verifying the mathematical accuracy."
"In order to be able to assess 
an impairment risk in the event of a possible change in one of the key assumptions, we 
assessed the company's sensitivity analyses."
"As part of our audit, we asked the executive 
directors about the existence of indications of impairment of the investment in Porsche AG and 
evaluated the statements and information received on the basis of our knowledge of the legal 
and economic environment of the Porsche AG Group."
"We issued audit instructions to the 
auditor of the consolidated financial statements of Porsche AG, in which we provided guidance 
on risk assessment and the audit approach."
"In addition, we regularly obtained information on 
the current status of the audit in personal meetings and reviewed the working papers of the 
auditor of the consolidated financial statements."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of the investment 
in Porsche AG."
"❸ 
 
Assessment of legal risks and their presentation in the consolidated financial statements 
① 
 
Risk for the consolidated financial statements 
As an investment-managing holding company, Porsche SE holds the investment in Volkswagen 
AG in particular."
"The assessment of the probability of occurrence of these 
legal risks at the level of Porsche SE is subject to a high degree of estimation and judgement 
uncertainty."
"Against this background, the assessment of these legal risks and their presentation 
in the consolidated financial statements was of particular significance in the context of our audit."
"②  
Audit approach 
In assessing the estimates of the legal risks made by the executive directors, we first obtained 
an understanding of the process in order to identify which controls the executive directors have 
implemented to recognize and assess risks at an early stage."
"We involved internal legal experts in our audit and 
obtained written confirmation letters from external lawyers."
"Furthermore, we evaluated the 
company's disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the assessment of legal risks 
and their presentation in the consolidated financial statements."
"Other Information 
 
The executive directors are responsible for the other information."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management 
report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion 
or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in this 
regard."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility 
for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible 
for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an 
intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to 
do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with section 316 ff."
"HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in 
compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material 
misstatement."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group 
management report."
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
"The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control."
"· 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the 
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"· 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the group management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit."
"We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinions."
"· 
Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial 
statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"· 
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors 
in the group management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we 
evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis 
for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective 
information from these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate audit opinion on the 
prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial 
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibility in 
accordance therewith is further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Assurance 
Work on the ESEF Documents” section."
"Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality 
Management 1 “Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm” (IDW QMS 1 
(09.2022))."
"1 HGB 
and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with  
section 328 paragraph 1 sentence 4 no."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF 
documents as part of the financial reporting process."
"Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents 
 
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are  
free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of  
section 328 paragraph 1 HGB."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the assurance work."
"· 
Evaluate whether the ESEF documents enables a XHTML rendering with content equivalent to 
the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report."
"Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation  
We were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on 30 June 2023."
"We were 
engaged by the supervisory board on 7 August 2023."
"We have been the group auditor of the 
Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Stuttgart, without interruption since the financial year 2023."
"We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are consistent with the 
additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation  
(long-form audit report)."
"Other Matter – Use of the Auditor’s Report 
Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial 
statements and the audited group management report as well as the assured ESEF documents."
"In particular, the ESEF report and our 
assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF 
documents made available in electronic form."
"They are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that is free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
"Auditor’s Responsibilities  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, 
based on our audit."
"We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards 
for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public 
Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including 
the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the remuneration report."
The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement.
"This includes the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report, whether due to fraud or 
error, including the related disclosures."
"In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the 
internal control system relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report, including the related 
disclosures."
"The objective is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control 
system."
"An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by management and the supervisory board, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion."
"Since we express an unqualified opinion on the content of the remuneration 
report, this opinion includes that the information pursuant to section 162 paragraph 1 and 2 AktG have 
been made in all material respects in the remuneration report."
"Restriction of use  
We issue this auditor's report on the basis of the engagement agreed with Porsche Automobil Holding 
SE."
"The audit was conducted for the purposes of the Company and the auditor's report is solely intended 
to inform the Company about the results of the audit."
"Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's 
report is solely to the Company in accordance with this engagement."
"The auditor's report is not intended 
for third parties to make (investment and/or asset) decisions based on it."
"Accordingly, we do not assume 
any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third parties; in particular, no third parties are included 
in the scope of protection of this contract."
"Section 334 of the German Civil Code [Bürgerliches 
Gesetzbuch - BGB], according to which defences arising from a contract can also be asserted against 
third parties, is not waived."
"Gross margin provides information on 
profitability net of cost of sales."
"Dividend yield 
 
The dividend yield is the ratio of the dividend for the 
reporting year to the closing price per share class 
on the last trading day of the reporting year; it 
represents the interest rate earned per share."
"The 
dividend yield is used in particular for measuring 
and comparing shares."
"Equity ratio 
 
The equity ratio measures the percentage of total 
assets attributable to shareholders’ equity as of a 
reporting date."
"This ratio indicates the stability and 
financial strength of the company and shows the 
degree of financial independence."
"Operating result 
 
The revenue of the Volkswagen Group, which does 
not include the figures for its Chinese joint ventures 
accounted for at equity, reflects the market success 
of the Volkswagen Group in financial terms."
"Following adjustment for its use of resources, the 
operating result reflects the actual business activity 
of Volkswagen and documents the economic 
success of its core business."
"Operating return on sales 
 
The operating return on sales of the Volkswagen 
Group is the ratio of the operating result to revenue."
"Plug-in-hybrid 
 
Performance levels of hybrid vehicles."

hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have a larger 
battery with a correspondingly higher capacity that 
can be charged via the combustion engine, the 
brake system, or an electrical outlet."
"This increases 
the range of the vehicle."
