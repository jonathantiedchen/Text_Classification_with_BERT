Operating and Financial Review
This section contains a number of forward-looking statements."
"These statements 
are based on current management expectations, and actual results may differ 
materially."
"Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ from 
management’s expectations are those described in Risk Factors and Note 
Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Annual Report."
The discussion that follows focuses on 2023 with comparisons to 2022.
"For 
discussion of the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, refer to 
our December 31, 2022 Annual Report."
"Operating Results
Overview
Net sales growth continued in 2023 in the non-COVID product portfolio amid a 
challenging macro-environment, and total 2023 net sales of $2.0 billion reflect 
the advancement of our strategy of ""Focus and Balance"" on areas offering the 
highest growth potential."
"Focus involves our Five Pillars of Growth strategy to 
make significant investments in the commercialization and development of (1) 
Sample technologies, (2) QuantiFERON, (3) QIAcuity, (4) NeuMoDx and (5) 
QIAstat-DX."
"Balance involves developing our portfolio to address more than 
500,000 customers across the Life Sciences and Molecular Diagnostics, as well 
as to build out our global presence in markets offering growth potential."
"We made solid progress in driving growth of our consumables business, which 
accounts for over 85% of our sales, while expanding our installed instrument 
base."
"Financial highlights of 2023 include:
• While net sales from our non-COVID product portfolio grew 8% in 2023, 
total net sales declined 8% over the year-ago period, reflecting a 66% 
decline in net sales from COVID-19 products."
"• The operating income margin in 2023 was 20.9% of sales compared to 
24.8% in 2022, reflecting lower sales contributions as well as higher 
expenses from recent production capacity expansion projects, investments in 
research and development include BLIRT S.A."
"which we 
acquired in May 2022 and January 2023, respectively."
"• Net cash provided by operating activities declined 36% to $459 million in 
2023 from $715 million in 2022."
"Results in 2023 reflected the reduced net 
income compared with 2022 results, as well as higher working capital 
requirements, in particular an increase in inventories to ensure product 
availability."
"We continue to invest to support internal growth with a high level of investment 
into research and development for menu expansion of our key platforms as well 
as our IT infrastructure."
"Additionally, in January 2024, we completed a 
synthetic share repurchase that combined a direct capital repayment to 
shareholders with a reverse stock split."
"This approach is designed to return cash 
to shareholders in a more efficient way than through a traditional open-market 
repurchase program."
"In January 2023, we acquired Verogen, Inc., a leader in the use of next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to drive the future of human 
identification (HID) and forensic investigation."
"Verogen, a privately held 
company founded in 2017 based in San Diego, California, supports the global 
human identification community with NGS tools and professional services to 
help resolve criminal and missing-persons cases."
"In May 2022, we acquired 
BLIRT S.A., a supplier of standardized and customized solutions for proteins 
and enzymes as well as molecular biology reagents located in Gdańsk, Poland."
"These acquisitions were not significant to the overall consolidated financial 
statements."
"As of April 1, 2022, the results of our subsidiary in Türkiye are reported under 
highly inflationary accounting, as the prior three-years cumulative inflation rate 
exceeded 100%."
"Foreign Currencies
The reporting currency of QIAGEN N.V."
"The functional 
currency of most of our subsidiaries are the local currencies of the countries in 
which they are headquartered."
"All amounts in the financial statements of entities 
whose functional currency is not the U.S."
dollar are translated into U.S.
"Translation gains or losses are 
recorded in equity, and transaction gains and losses are reflected in net 
income."
"Overall 
sales in this product group declined 17% in 2023 to $663.0 million, due to 
significant drop-off in the pandemic testing demand."
"Growth in Non-COVID 
product sales were supported by higher sales of consumables that more than 
offset the decline in instruments."
"Sales results for 2023 were adversely 
impacted by approximately one percentage point of currency movements over 
the prior year."
"Diagnostic Solutions involve the sale of regulated consumables kits and 
instruments for use in clinical healthcare, as well as revenues from our Precision 
QIAGEN N.V."

Diagnostics portfolio and companion diagnostic co-development projects with 
pharmaceutical companies."
"Sales in this product group grew 6% to $697.6 
million in 2023."
"The QuantiFERON-TB test for tuberculosis detection maintained 
a solid pace with 24% growth in 2023 and QIAstat-DX sales rose, supported 
by an ongoing high level of placements."
"NeuMoDx sales were down compared 
to the significant COVID-19 sales in 2022, but exceeded the annual sales goal 
in 2023."
"Sales in the rest of this product group declined, mainly due to lower 
sales of COVID-19 products."
"PCR / Nucleic Acid Amplification involves consumables kits and 
instruments used in non-regulated applications."
"Sales in this product group fell 
23% to $300.2 million due to a sharp decline in COVID product group 
demand, as well as the drop-off in sales of OEM products."
"The QIAcuity digital 
PCR system delivered solid growth in 2023 over 2022 results, driven by 
increasing consumables pull through and new placements especially to 
biopharma customers."
"Genomics / NGS involves our portfolio of universal solutions for use on any 
next-generation sequencer (NGS) as well as the QIAGEN Digital Insights 
bioinformatics business and other products used in genomics analysis 
workflows."
"Sales in this product group rose 6% to $238.9 million in 2023 
driven by business expansion in the bioinformatics business and the portfolios 
of universal NGS solutions for use with various third-party NGS systems."
"Higher 
sales were seen in the U.S."
"and Mexico, against lower results in Canada over 
the prior year."
"Sales in this region were not materially affected by currency 
movements."
"The Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region's results were also 
affected by the decline in COVID-19 sales, partially offset by one percentage 
point of favorable currency movements against the U.S."
"Among the top-
performing countries in 2023 were Spain, France and the United Kingdom."
"The Asia Pacific, Japan and Rest of World region saw an overall sales 
decline in 2023 over the prior year."
"Sales in this region were adversely 
impacted by three percentage points from unfavorable currency movements 
against the U.S."

The gross margin in 2023 primarily reflects changes in individual product sales 
and mix."
"Generally, our consumables and related products have a higher gross 
margin than our instrumentation products and service arrangements."
"Fluctuations in the sales levels between periods can cause changes in gross 
profit between periods."
"In 2023, gross margin decreased in line with the 
significant decline in the overall sales level, which was mainly due to the sharp 
reduction in COVID-19 product group revenues."
"The gross margin in 2023 also 
includes costs for higher material and logistics costs over the year-ago periods."
"The amortization expense on acquisition-related intangibles within cost of sales 
increased to $64.2 million in 2023 compared to $60.5 million in 2022 and 
includes amortization related to Verogen acquired in January 2023."
"Our 
acquisition-related intangible amortization will increase in the event of future 
acquisitions."
"The overall decrease in sales and 
marketing expenses primarily reflects lower freight and other supply chain 
costs."
"Sales and marketing expenses are primarily associated with personnel, 
commissions, advertising, trade shows, publications, freight and logistics 
expenses, and other promotional expenses."
"The increased use of digital 
customer engagement continues to build on the new habits of customers and 
enhance customer engagement with a focus on greater efficiency and 
effectiveness."
"Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased 5% to $198.5 million in 2023 
compared to 2022 and rose to 10.1% of sales from 8.9% in 2022."
"Results for 
2023 included $2.6 million of unfavorable currency exchange movements."
"Research and development expense reflects our continued focus on our Five 
Pillars of Growth, including investments in NeuMoDx, QIAstat-Dx and QIAcuity."
"These investments are targeting new applications within our Five Pillars of 
Growth to drive sustainable post-pandemic expansion."
"As we continue to 
discover, develop and acquire new products and technologies, we expect to 
incur additional expenses related to facilities, licenses and employees engaged 
in research and development."
"Overall, research and development costs are 
expected to increase as a result of seeking regulatory approvals, including U.S."
"FDA Pre-Market Approval (PMA), U.S."
"FDA 510(k) clearance and EU CE 
approval of certain assays or instruments."
"Further, business combinations, along 
with the acquisition of new technologies, may increase our research and 
development costs in the future."
"We have a strong commitment to innovation 
and expect to continue to make investments in our research and development 
efforts."
"General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses declined 8% to $119.3 million in 2023 
and remained unchanged to 6.1% of sales compared to 2022."
"Results for 2023 
included $1.0 million of unfavorable currency exchange movements."
"We 
expect future costs to increase due to higher licensing and information 
technology costs as well as increased cyber security costs."
"The 
decrease reflects the full amortization of certain previously acquired assets."
"Amortization expense related to developed technology and patent and license 
rights acquired in business combinations are included in cost of sales."
"Our acquisition-related intangible amortization 
recorded in operating expenses will increase in the event of future acquisitions."
"Restructuring, Acquisition, Integration and Other, net
Restructuring, acquisition, integration and other, net expenses decreased to 
$35.3 million in 2023, or 1.8% of sales, from $44.8 million, or 2.1% of sales, 
in 2022."
"Expenses incurred in 2023 included charges related to the 2022 
restructuring program, as discussed further in Note 6 ""Restructuring,"" as well as 
costs related to our acquisition of Verogen, Inc."
"Expenses 
incurred in 2022 included costs related to our BLIRT S.A."
"Additionally in 2022, we incurred $4.6 million of charges related to the 2022 
restructuring program."
"The increase in 2023 compared 
to the prior year was due to increasing interest rates and the duration and level 
of short-term investments held during the period."
"Interest expense primarily relates to debt, as discussed in Note 16 ""Debt"" in the 
accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements."
"The decrease in 
2023 compared to 2022 is driven by the repayment of the 2023 Notes that 
matured in September 2023 totaling $400.0 million partially offset by the 
issuance of German private placement bonds in July and August 2022 totaling 
€370.0 million."
"Other (expense) income, net was $5.7 million of expense for the year ended 
December 31, 2023."
"Other expense included a loss of $5.8 million on foreign 
currency transactions and $4.2 million of impairments in non-marketable 
investments not accounted for under the equity method, partially offset by $4.2 
million of income from equity method investments."
"Other (expense) income, net was $6.7 million of income for the year ended 
December 31, 2022."
"Other income included $3.8 million of income from 
equity method investments and a gain of $2.7 million on foreign currency 
transactions."
"Our 
effective tax rate differs from the Netherlands statutory tax rate of 25.8% due in 
part to our operating subsidiaries being exposed to statutory tax rates ranging 
from zero to 35%."
"Fluctuations in the distribution of pre-tax income or loss 
among our operating subsidiaries can lead to fluctuations of the effective tax 
rate in the consolidated financial statements."
"We record partial tax exemptions 
on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Germany."
"These foreign 
tax benefits are due to a combination of favorable tax laws and exemptions in 
these jurisdictions, including intercompany foreign royalty income in Germany 
which is statutorily exempt from trade tax."
"Further, we have intercompany 
financing arrangements in which the intercompany income is nontaxable in 
Dubai."
"The effective tax rate in 2022 reflects the release of uncertain tax 
positions following the conclusion of tax audits covering the 2014 to 2016 
years in the second quarter of 2022."
"See Note 17 ""Income Taxes"" to the 
consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the Netherlands' 
statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate."
"Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, we have funded our business through internally generated funds, debt, 
as well as private and public sales of equity."
"Our primary use of cash has been 
to strengthen our business operations, while our investing activities have 
focused on capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions."

"dollars and euros, other 
than those cash balances maintained in the local currency of subsidiaries to 
meet local working capital needs."
"The decrease in short-term investments at December 31, 
2023, is the result of our active cash management."
"The overall lower cash and 
cash equivalent balance together with a higher current portion of long-term debt 
led to the decrease of working capital at December 31, 2023."
"While net income was $341.3 million in 2023, non-cash components in 
income included $205.3 million of depreciation and amortization, $47.1 
million of share-based compensation and $30.2 million of amortization of debt 
discount and issuance costs."
"Cash flow impacts from changes in operating 
assets and liabilities primarily reflect increased inventories to support customer 
demand trends in light of global supply chain tensions."
"Given that we rely 
heavily on cash generated from our operating activities to fund our business, a 
decrease in demand for our products, longer collection cycles or significant 
technology advances by competitors could have a negative impact on our 
liquidity."
"Investing Activities
Approximately $87.7 million of cash was used in investing activities in 2023 
compared to $726.8 million in 2022."
"This was partially offset by cash inflows of $1.3 
billion from the redemption of short-term investments."
"This was partially offset 
by cash inflows of $883.1 million from the redemption of short-term 
investments."
"Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in financing activities was 
$433.8 million compared to $125.8 million in 2022."
"This 
was partially offset by proceeds of $371.5 million from the issuance of long-
term debt and $12.6 million received from our derivative counterparties to 
collateralize derivative assets that we hold with them."
"Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2023, we carry $1.5 billion of long-term debt, of which 
$0.6 billion is current and $0.9 billion is long-term."
"The interest rate is linked to our ESG 
performance."
"As of December 31, 2023, a total of $408.0 million is 
outstanding."

"In November 2018, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 
Cash Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (2024 Notes)."
"Interest on the

"The 2024 Notes will mature on November 13, 2024, unless 
repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date."
"In September 2017, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 
Cash Convertible Senior Notes due in 2023 (2023 Notes) which were due and

floating or fixed rates, and due at various dates through June 2027."
"As of 
December 31, 2023, a total of $121.0 million is outstanding."
"In December 2020, we obtained a €400 million syndicated revolving credit 
facility with a contractual life of three years, and with the ability to be extended 
twice by a one-year period."
No amounts were utilized during 2023.
"The facility 
can be utilized in euros and bears interest of 0.550% to 1.500% above 
EURIBOR, and is offered with interest periods of one, three or six months."
"The 
interest rate is linked to our ESG performance."
"We have additional credit lines 
totaling €13.0 million with no expiration date."
"None of these credit lines were 
utilized in 2023."
"We have lease obligations, including interest, in the aggregate amount of 
$109.9 million, of which $25.1 million was current as of December 31, 2023."
"We also have purchase obligations of $98.8 million and license commitments 
of $7.2 million."
"In connection with certain acquisitions that we have completed, 
QIAGEN could be required to make additional contingent cash payments of up 
to $20.7 million based on the achievement of certain revenue and operating 
results milestones."
"These obligations are further discussed in Note 12 ""Leases"" 
and Note 20 ""Commitments and Contingencies"" in the consolidated financial 
statements."
"Liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, including interest and 
penalties, were estimated at $98.9 million as of December 31, 2023."
"Ultimate 
settlement of these liabilities is dependent on factors outside of our control, such 
as examinations by the respective taxing authorities and expiration of statutes 
of limitation for assessment of additional taxes."
"Therefore, we cannot 
reasonably estimate when, if ever, this amount will be paid."
"In January 2024, we completed a synthetic share repurchase that combined a 
direct capital repayment with a reverse stock split."
"The transaction was 
announced on January 7, 2024, and involved an approach used by various 
large, multinational Dutch companies to provide returns to all shareholders in a 
faster and more efficient manner than traditional open-market repurchases."
"$295.2 million was returned to shareholders through the transaction, which 
reduced the total number of issued Common Shares by approximately 3% to 
223.9 million (of which 2.5 million are held in Treasury Shares) as of January 
31, 2024."
"We did not use special purpose entities and did not have any off-balance sheet 
financing arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 
and 2021."
"We expect that cash from financing activities will continue to be impacted by 
issuances of our common shares in connection with our equity compensation 
plans, and that the market performance of our shares will impact the timing and 
volume of the issuances."
"Additionally, we may make future acquisitions or 
investments requiring cash payments, the issuance of additional debt or equity 
financing."
"We believe that funds from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, 
together with the proceeds from any public and private sales of equity, and 
availability of financing facilities, would be sufficient to fund our planned 
operations and expansion in the coming year."
"However, any global economic 
downturn may have a greater impact on our business than currently expected, 
and we may experience a decrease in the sales of our products, which could

impact our ability to generate cash."
"If our future cash flows from operations and 
other capital resources are not adequate to fund our liquidity needs, we may be 
required to obtain additional debt or equity financing or to reduce or delay our 
capital expenditures, acquisitions or research and development projects."
"If we 
could not obtain financing on a timely basis or at satisfactory terms, or 
implement timely reductions in our expenditures, our business could be 
adversely affected."
"Policy on Dividend Distribution
We have not paid any dividends on our Shares since our inception."
"In January 
2017 and January 2024 we completed synthetic share repurchases that 
combined direct capital repayments with reverse stock splits."
"Credit Rating
We currently do not have a rating issued by any credit rating agency."
"Critical accounting estimates are those that require the most complex or 
subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the 
effects of matters that are inherently uncertain."
"Thus, to the extent that actual 
events differ from management’s estimates and assumptions, there could be a 
material impact to the financial statements."
"Our 
critical accounting estimates are those related to income taxes, share-based 
compensation, acquisitions, amortized intangible assets, and fair value 
measurements."
"Income Taxes
Calculation of our tax provision is complex due to our international operations 
and the multiple taxing jurisdictions in which we operate."
"Some of our deferred 
tax assets relate to net operating losses (NOL)."
"The utilization of NOLs is not 
assured and is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future."
"In the event that 
actual circumstances differ from management’s estimates, or to the extent that 
these estimates are adjusted in the future, any changes to the valuation 
allowance could materially impact our financial position and results of 
operations."
"The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the 
application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions across 
our global operations."
"ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax 
position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will 
be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or 
litigation processes on the basis of technical merits."
"We record unrecognized 
tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our 
judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not 
previously available."
"Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, 
the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from 
our current estimate of the unrecognized tax liabilities."
"These differences will be 
reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in 
which the new information is available."
"Share-Based Compensation
Our stock plan allows for the granting of stock rights, incentive stock options, as 
well as for non-qualified options, stock grants and stock-based awards."
"We 
grant performance-based stock units subject to performance periods of three 
years."
"Thus, the estimates of performance achieved during the performance 
period may be subject to significant changes from period to period as the 
performance is completed."

compensation expense resulting from an adjustment in the estimated shares to 
be released is treated as a cumulative catch-up in the period of adjustment."
"If 
any of the assumptions or estimates used change significantly, share-based 
compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the 
current period."
"Acquisitions
We frequently enter into business combinations and must determine whether an 
acquired entity is considered to be a business or an asset or group of assets."
"A 
portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business 
combination."
"Transaction costs are expensed in a business combination, yet 
capitalized in an asset acquisition."
"Contingent payments and in-process 
research and development costs are also handled differently."
"A set of assets is 
not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the acquired gross assets is 
concentrated in a single asset or group of similar identifiable assets."
"In 
determining whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set 
of assets, application of the ""substantially all"" threshold requires judgment."
"An acquisition may include contingent consideration as part of the 
purchase price."
"Contingent consideration is accounted for at fair value at the 
acquisition date, with subsequent changes to the fair value being recognized in 
earnings."
We have made several acquisitions of businesses in recent years.
"The purchase 
prices for the acquisitions were allocated to tangible and intangible assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the 
acquisition dates."
"In most acquisitions, we engage an independent third-party 
valuation firm to assist us in determining the estimated fair values of acquired 
in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets."
"We believe the estimated fair 
values of contingent consideration and assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
are based on reasonable assumptions."
"However, the fair value estimates for the 
purchase price allocations may change during the allowable allocation period, 
which is up to one year from the acquisition dates, if additional information 
becomes available."
"Amortized Intangible Assets
We assess amortized intangible assets at least annually, as of October 1st of 
each year, for indications of impairment and immediately upon an indicator of 
possible impairment."
"Intangibles are assessed for recoverability considering the 
contract life, where applicable, and the period of time over which the 
intangible will contribute to future cash flow."
"The unamortized cost of intangible 
assets, where cash flows are independent and identifiable from other assets, is 
evaluated periodically and adjusted, if necessary, if events and circumstances 
indicate that a decline in value below the carrying amount has occurred."
"Due to 
the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions, and 
the effects of changes in circumstances affecting the valuation, both the 
precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty."
"As 
additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates."
"We primarily apply the market 
approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximize our use of 
observable inputs and minimize our use of unobservable inputs."
"We utilize the 
mid-point price between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of our 
assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value."
"In addition to using 
market data, we make assumptions in valuing assets and liabilities, including 
assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation 
technique."
"Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the 
marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from 
observable data, or are supported by observable prices at which transactions 
are executed in the marketplace."
"Certain of our acquisitions involve contingent consideration, the payment of 
which is contingent on the occurrence of future events."
"Contingent consideration 
is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and is initially recognized at 
fair value as a cost of the acquisition."
"After the acquisition, the contingent 
consideration liability is remeasured each reporting period."
"Significant judgment is used in developing these estimates 
and assumptions both at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods."
"If 
actual events differ from management's estimates, or to the extent these 
estimates are adjusted in the future, our financial position or results of 
operations could be affected in the period of any change."
"Additionally, our Level 3 instruments include non-marketable equity security 
investments."
"Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured 
at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable 
price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the 
same issuer."
"Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market 
approach as of the transaction date."
"For other fair value measurements, we generally use an income approach to 
measure fair value when there is not a market observable price for an identical 
or similar asset or liability."
"This approach utilizes management’s best 
assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the 
expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate."
"The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our 
accounting policies."
"In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular 
transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 
in the United States, with limited or no need for management’s judgment."
"There 
are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting available 
alternatives may or may not produce a materially different result."
"See our 
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this Annual 
Report, containing a description of accounting policies and other disclosures 
required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States."
"However, because of 
the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation, should the outcomes be 
unfavorable, certain aspects of our business, financial condition, and results of 
operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected."
"For information on legal proceedings, see Note 20 ""Commitments and 
Contingencies"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
"QIAGEN is managed by a Managing Board and an independent Supervisory 
Board appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders."
"One of the 
Managing Board's responsibilities is the oversight of the risk management 
system."
"The Managing Board has developed and implemented strategies, 
controls and mitigation measures to identify current and developing risks as 
part of this system."
"These policies and procedures are embodied in our 
corporate governance, code of ethics and financial reporting controls and 
procedures."
"A variety of functional experts evaluate these business risks, 
attempting to mitigate and manage them on an ongoing basis."
"All identified risks are evaluated based on their likelihood of occurring and their 
potential impact (estimated in monetary terms) on disrupting our progress in 
achieving our business objectives."
"The overall risk management goal is to 
identify risks that could significantly threaten our success and to provide 
management the opportunity to successfully implement mitigation actions on a 
timely basis."
"The results of the risk assessment, and any updates, are reported 
to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on a regular basis."
"A detailed 
risk reporting update is provided each quarter to the Audit Committee for 
specific risks that have been newly identified or have changed since the 
previous assessment."
"We maintain internal controls to ensure the integrity 
of financial reporting, which is described further in Controls and Procedures."
"Describing the risk factors in order of significance does 
not imply that a lower-listed risk factor may not have a material adverse impact 
on our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources."
"Our continued growth is dependent on the development and 
success of new products."
"Rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions are typical 
in the markets we serve."
"Our success will depend in part on continuous, timely 
development and introduction of new products that address sometimes rapidly 
evolving market requirements, such as the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 
virus."
"We believe successful new product introductions provide a significant 
competitive advantage because many customers make an investment of time 
into selecting and learning how to use a new product and are reluctant to 
switch after these efforts."
"To the extent that we fail to introduce new and 
innovative products, or such products suffer significant delays in development or 
are not accepted by customers, we may lose market share to our competitors 
that would be difficult or impossible to regain."
"An inability to successfully 
develop and introduce new products, for technological or other reasons, could 
reduce our growth prospects or otherwise have an adverse effect on our 
business."
"In the past, we have experienced delays in the development and 
introduction of new products, caused by delays in regulatory approvals, for 
example, or decisions to stop development of projects, and we may experience 
delays or make decisions to stop certain product development in the future."

technologies."
"In the development of new products, we may make significant investments in 
intellectual property, software solutions and manufacturing capacity."
"These 
investments increase our fixed costs, resulting in higher operational costs in the 
short term that will negatively impact our gross profit and operating income 
until products potentially reach a minimum level of market acceptance and 
sales."
"The expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development 
activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could materially 
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of 
operations."
"Our continued growth depends significantly on the success of new products in 
the molecular research and testing markets that we serve, and our ability to 
scale manufacturing capacities to meet customer demands."
"Important product 
programs in early commercialization stage include the QIAstat-Dx system for 
one-step, fully integrated molecular analysis of hard-to-diagnose syndromes, 
the NeuMoDx 96 and 288 systems offering fully integrated PCR clinical testing, 
and the QIAcuity digital PCR system."
"The speed and level of adoption of our new automation platforms will affect 
sales not only of instrumentation but also of consumables kits – identified as 
sample and assay kits – that are designed to run on the systems in a ""razor-
razorblade"" model."
"The rollout of new automation platforms are intended to 
drive the dissemination and increasing sales of consumables for these systems."
"We are developing or co-developing new kits for these platforms and seeking 
regulatory approvals for a number of new products."
"In turn, the availability and 
regulatory approval of more tests for processing on the QIAstat-Dx, NeuMoDx 
and QIAcuity systems will influence the value of the instruments to prospective 
customers."
"Slower adoption of these systems could significantly affect sales of 
instruments as well as consumables products designed to run on these 
platforms."
"An inability to manage our growth, manage the expansion of our 
operations, or successfully integrate acquired businesses could 
adversely affect our business."
"Our business has grown in recent years, with total net sales increasing to 
$1.97 billion in 2023 from $1.53 billion in 2019."
"In addition to incremental 
sales from our global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made a 
series of acquisitions in recent years, including the acquisitions of Verogen, Inc."
in January 2023 and BLIRT S.A.
"We intend to identify and acquire 
other businesses in the future that support our strategy to build on our global 
leadership position in providing Sample to Insight solutions focused on 
molecular research and clinical testing."
"The successful integration of acquired 
businesses requires a significant effort and expense across all operational 
areas."
We continue to make investments to expand our existing business operations.
"These projects increase our fixed costs, resulting in higher operational costs in 
the short term that will negatively impact our gross profit and operating income 
until we more fully utilize the additional capacity of these facilities."
"The 
expansion of our business and the addition of new personnel may place a 
strain on our management and operational systems."
"Our future operating results will depend on our ability to continue to implement 
and improve our research, product development, manufacturing, sales and 
marketing and customer support programs, enhance our operational and 
QIAGEN N.V."
"There can be no assurance that we will be able to 
manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisitions successfully, and 
any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations."
"Our acquisitions expose us to new risks, and we may not achieve 
the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of technologies and 
businesses."
"During the past several years, we have acquired and integrated a number of 
companies, as mentioned earlier, through which we have gained access to new 
technologies, products and businesses that complement our internally 
developed product lines."
"In the future, we expect to acquire additional 
technologies, products or businesses to expand our operations."
"Our failure to address the above risks successfully in the future may prevent us 
from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable 
time frame, or at all."
"Global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, 
results of operations and financial condition."
"Our results of operations could be materially affected by adverse general 
conditions in the global economy and financial markets, including inflation and 
rising interest rates."
"Direct conflicts, such as the ongoing wars in Ukraine and 
the Middle East, and an increasingly challenging economic environment lead to 
uncertainty about the future."
"Trade restrictions or export controls, as were seen 
with the Russia-Ukraine war, could disrupt our supply chain and flow of 
products if they disturb the international flow of goods and increase costs."
Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted if the U.S.
"federal 
government were to enact automatic spending cuts (sequestration), which have 
occurred in the past."
"National Institutes of Health (NIH) and similar 
bodies."
"While there has been global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
higher inflation continues, including on raw material prices which also reflect 
higher energy costs."
"The overall increase in energy costs and materials has had 
a significant adverse impact on our business."
"Access to financing in the global financial markets has been adversely affected 
for many businesses in light of the high-inflation environment."
"The central banks 
QIAGEN N.V."
"This may impact our ability to 
obtain new or refinance existing debt facilities at competitive rates."
"Additionally, our customers may face internal financing pressures that adversely 
impact spending decisions or the ability to purchase our products, or that lead 
to a delay in collection of receivables and thus negatively impact our cash flow."
Our business involves operations around the world.
"Our primary manufacturing 
facilities are located in Germany, the U.S., Spain and China."
"We have 
established sales subsidiaries in numerous countries, and our products are sold 
through independent distributors serving more than 60 countries."
"Our global 
footprint exposes us to unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or 
other natural events."
"We have analyzed climate change risk and its potential 
impact on our largest production and logistics sites, as well as important sites of 
our key suppliers."
"No material risks were identified that could potentially impact 
our business, operations, sales or expenditures."
"However, our facilities may be 
harmed by unforeseen events."
"In the event that we or our customers are affected 
by a disaster, we may experience delays or reductions in sales or production."
"We may also face significantly increased costs or be required to identify 
alternate suppliers and/or rely on third-party manufacturers."
"To the extent that our suppliers are impacted by a natural disaster or other 
disruption, we may experience periods of reduced production."
"Any unexpected 
interruptions in our production capabilities may lead to delayed or lost sales 
and adversely affect our results of operations for a specific period."
"In addition, to the extent we temporarily shut down any facility following such 
an unforeseen event, we may experience disruptions in our ability to 
manufacture or ship products to customers or otherwise operate our business."
"Many of our products are manufactured in a single location, and we may 
experience significantly adverse effects to the extent that these manufacturing 
operations are disrupted and cannot be replaced elsewhere."
"While our global operations give us the ability to ship some products from 
alternative sites, we may not be able to do so because the facilities of our 
customers are shut or the local logistics infrastructure is not functioning."
"As a 
result, our sales, profitability and cash flows would suffer."

Damage to our property due to unforeseen events, and the resulting disruption 
of our business, may be covered by insurance."
"However, this insurance may 
not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses, and the insurance coverage 
may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all."
"In 
addition, we may incur incremental costs following an unforeseen event, which 
will reduce profits and adversely affect our results of operations."
"Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability in any 
region could adversely affect our business."
"Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities 
could damage the world economy, adversely affect the global supply chain and 
materially impact the availability of and prices for energy and other raw 
materials."
"In February 2022, the government of Russia invaded Ukraine."
"The 
ongoing war is so far confined to Ukraine, but any expansion into other 
countries could materially disrupt our operations in Europe and/or increase our 
operating costs."
"In addition, Russia's prior annexation of Crimea, the 
annexation of various regions of Ukraine and subsequent military interventions 
have led to sanctions being levied by the European Union, the U.S."
"and other 
countries against Russia."
"Additionally, in October 2023, Hamas launched a 
series of coordinated attacks on Israeli targets, and Israel responded by 
formally declaring war on Hamas."
"The armed conflict is ongoing and rapidly 
evolving as of the date of this filing, and its length and outcome are highly 
unpredictable."
"We depend on suppliers for materials used to manufacture our 
products, and if shipments from these suppliers are delayed or 
interrupted, we may be unable to manufacture our products."
"We buy materials to create our products from a number of suppliers and are 
not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers for our business as a 
whole."
"However, key components of certain products, including certain 
instrumentation and chemicals, are available only from a single source."
"If 
supplies from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason, we may 
not be able to obtain these materials in a timely manner or in sufficient quantity 
or quality to produce certain products, and this could have an adverse impact 
on our results of operations."
"In 2022, the volatility in product availability and pricing drastically increased 
compared to previous years."
"In 2023, while availability continued to improve, 
raw material prices increased, reflecting higher energy costs and inflation."
"Supply chain constraints have required, and may continue to require, in certain 
instances, alternative delivery arrangements and increased costs and could 
have a material adverse effect on our business and operations."
"We rely heavily on air cargo carriers and other overnight logistics 
services, and shipping delays or interruptions could harm our 
business."
"Our customers typically keep only a modest inventory of our consumables kits 
on hand, and consequently often require rapid delivery of purchases."
"Additionally, some of our products require complex supply chains, such as 
constant cold storage or shipment using dry ice."
"As a result, we rely heavily on 
air cargo carriers and logistic suppliers."
"If these services are suspended or 
delayed, and other delivery and logistic suppliers cannot provide satisfactory 
services, customers may be forced to suspend a significant amount of their 
work."
"The lack of adequate delivery alternatives would have a serious adverse 
impact on our customer relations and results of operations."
"Changes in tax laws or their application or the termination or 
reduction of certain government tax incentives, could adversely 
impact our overall effective tax rate, results of operations or 
financial flexibility."
"Our effective tax rate reflects the benefit of some income being partially exempt 
from income taxes due to various inter-company operating and financing 
activities."
"The benefit also derives from our global operations, where income or 
loss in some jurisdictions is taxed at rates higher or lower than the statutory rate 
of 25.8% in the Netherlands."
"Changes in tax laws, including changes resulting 
from the current work being led by the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
QIAGEN N.V."
"The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is 
likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining 
jurisdictional taxation rights and establishing a 15% global minimum tax 
(referred to as Pillar Two)."
"The Netherlands formally enacted the Pillar Two 
legislation into domestic law and certain aspects of Pillar Two are effective 
January 1, 2024, and other aspects effective January 1, 2025."
"Although 
global enactment has begun, the OECD and participating countries continue to 
work on defining the underlying rules and administrative procedures."
"Pillar Two 
is effective for us in 2024."
"The increased tax burden as a result of changes in law could be material and 
may adversely affect our results of operations, cash taxes and effective tax rate."
"Additionally, depending on the timing of effective dates, changes in tax law 
may limit our ability to accurately forecast the related tax impacts."
"If our tax 
positions are challenged by taxing authorities or other governmental bodies, 
such as the European Commission, we could incur additional tax liabilities, 
which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial 
flexibility or cash flow."
"We rely on secure communication and information systems and 
are subject to privacy and data security laws which, in the event 
of a disruption, breach, violation or failure, could adversely affect 
our business."
"We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our 
business."
"Our operations rely on 
the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other 
information on both our own and cloud-based computer systems and networks."
"We have made significant investments to ensure our employees are aware of 
cyber security risks facing our company and how to prevent data breaches."
"We 
have modernized our cyber security tools, and are continually updating our 
cyber security processes, in an attempt to keep pace with evolving cyber 
security risks."
"In spite of our efforts, we are unable to completely eliminate these 
risks, and occasionally experience minor cyber security incidents."
"External 
phishing emails (occurring outside of our computer services) are a growing 
threat for our customers."
"These emails could lead to the disclosing of intellectual 
property or personally identifiable information, which could lead to financial 
harm or reputational damage."
"While our cyber security team works diligently 
with our employees around the world, as well as with our customers, to mitigate 
these threats by helping to identify and analyze phishing emails, we cannot 
guarantee that sensitive data will not be lost or stolen."
"A breach in cyber security due to unauthorized access to our computer systems 
or misuse could include the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, 
the corruption of data, or other operational disruption."
"Failures in our computer 
systems and networks could be caused by internal or external events, such as 
incursions by intruders or hackers, computer viruses, failures in hardware or 
software, or cyber-terrorists."
"Furthermore, there is an increased risk of cyber 
security attacks by state actors due to the Russian war with Ukraine."
"Russian 
ransomware gangs have threatened to increase hacking activity against critical 
infrastructure of any nation or organization that retaliates against Russia."
"Any 
such increase in such attacks on our third-party providers or other systems could 
adversely affect our network systems or other operations."
"If we experience a 
breach or failure of our systems, we could experience potentially significant 
operational delays due to the disruption of systems, loss due to theft or 
misappropriation of assets or data, or negative impacts from the loss of 
confidential data or intellectual property."
"We may face significant liability in 
the event personal information that we maintain is lost or otherwise subject to

misuse or other wrongful use, access or disclosure."
"Furthermore, we could 
experience significant negative publicity that could result in reputation or brand 
damage with customers or partners."
"Additionally, we are subject to privacy and data security laws across multiple 
jurisdictions."
"These include laws relating to the storage of health information 
that are complex, overlapping, sometimes contradictory and rapidly evolving."
"In the U.S., individual states regulate requirements and have authority over 
privacy and personal data protection."
"For example, the California Consumer 
Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020, imposes 
expansive new requirements and protections upon the processing of personal 
data, aimed at giving California consumers more visibility into and control over 
their personal information."
"states of Virginia and Colorado also 
enacted comprehensive data privacy laws similar to the CCPA, both of which 
became effective in 2023."
"In addition, laws in all 50 U.S."
"states require 
businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been 
disclosed as a result of a data breach."
"State laws are changing rapidly and 
there is discussion in the U.S."
"Congress of a new comprehensive federal data 
privacy law to which we would become subject if it is enacted."
"There are also 
European privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
of the European Union, that impose restrictions on the transfer, access, use and 
disclosure of health and other personal information."
"As our activities continue to 
evolve and expand, we may be subject to additional laws that impose further 
restrictions on the transfer, access, use and disclosure of health and other 
personal information, which may impact our business either directly or 
indirectly."
"A failure to comply with applicable privacy or security laws or 
significant changes in these laws could subject us to costly regulatory action or 
lawsuits, and could adversely impact our reputation, business and future 
business plans."
"We may encounter delays in receipt, or limits in the amount, of 
reimbursement approvals and public health funding, which may 
negatively impact our ability to grow revenues in the healthcare 
market or our profitability."
"Changes in the market availability or reimbursement of our diagnostic testing 
products by insurance providers and health maintenance organizations could 
have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations."
"Third-party 
payors are often reluctant to reimburse healthcare providers for the use of 
medical tests that involve new technologies or provide novel diagnostic 
information."
"In addition, third-party payors are increasingly limiting 
reimbursement coverage for medical diagnostic products and, in many 
instances, are even exerting pressure on suppliers to reduce their prices."
"Since 
each third-party payor often makes reimbursement decisions on an individual 
patient basis, obtaining such approvals is a time-consuming and costly process 
that requires us to provide scientific and clinical data supporting the clinical 
benefits of each of our products."
"As a result, there can be no assurance that 
reimbursement approvals will be obtained, and the process can delay the 
broad market introduction of new products."
"If third-party reimbursement is not 
consistent or financially adequate to cover the cost of our products, this could 
limit our ability to sell our products or cause us to reduce prices, which would 
adversely affect our results of operations."
"Further, the ability of many of our customers to successfully market their 
products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of 
these products is available from governmental health administrations, private 
health insurers and other organizations."
"Governmental and other third-party 
payors are increasingly seeking to contain healthcare costs and to reduce the 
price of medical products and services."
"With evolving political realities in the 
United States, certain sections of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
of 2010 (ACA) have not been fully implemented and the direction of healthcare 
policy is unpredictable."
"Uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in 
particular the impact on reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay 
in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively 
impact our product sales."
"In accordance with the Protecting Access to Medicare 
Act of 2014 (PAMA), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services calculate 
QIAGEN N.V."
"This new rate methodology means the 
lower reimbursement rates previously experienced in the field of molecular 
pathology testing now extend to additional diagnostic testing codes on the 
Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS)."
"If there are not adequate 
reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely 
affected."
"Reduction in R&D budgets and government funding may result in 
reduced sales."
"Our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
companies, academic institutions, and government and private laboratories."
"Fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these organizations 
could have a significant adverse effect on demand for our products."
"Research 
and development budgets are affected by changes in available resources, the 
mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, changes in spending 
priorities and institutional budgetary policies."
"Our results of operations could be 
adversely affected by any significant decrease in expenditures for life sciences 
research and development by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, 
academic institutions, and government and private laboratories."
"In addition, 
short-term changes in administrative, regulatory or purchasing-related 
procedures can create uncertainties or other impediments that can have an 
adverse impact on our results of operations."
"In recent years, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have 
undergone substantial restructuring and consolidation."
"Additional mergers or 
consolidation within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could 
cause us to lose existing customers and potential future customers, which could 
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations."
"We sell our products to universities, government laboratories and private 
foundations, whose funding is dependent on grants from government agencies, 
such as the NIH (National Institutes of Health) in the U.S."
"which accounts for the 
majority of Life Science funding in the country."
"Although the level of research 
funding has been increasing in recent years, we cannot ensure that this trend 
will continue given federal and state budget constraints."
"Government funding of 
research and development is subject to the political process, which is inherently 
unpredictable."
"Future sales may be adversely affected if our customers delay 
purchases as a result of uncertainties regarding the approval of government 
budget proposals."
"Also, government proposals to reduce or eliminate 
budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the NIH and 
government agencies in other countries that fund life sciences research and 
development activities."
"A reduction in government funding for the NIH or 
government research agencies in other countries could have a serious adverse 
impact on our results of operations."
Competition could reduce our sales.
The markets for most of our products are very competitive.
"Competitors may 
have significant advantages in financial, operational, sales and marketing 
resources as well as experience in research and development."
"These 
competitors may have developed, or could develop in the future, new 
technologies that compete with our products or even render our products 
obsolete."
Some competitors may obtain regulatory approval from the U.S.
"Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar non-U.S."
"Our competitors’ 
development of alternative products offering superior technology, greater cost-
effectiveness and/or receiving regulatory approval could have a material 
adverse effect on our sales and results of operations."
"The growth of our business depends in part on the continued conversion of 
users from competitive products to our sample and assay technologies and 
other solutions."
"Lack of conversion could have a material adverse effect on our 
sales and results of operations."
"It can be difficult for users of our products to switch from their current supplier of 
a particular product, primarily due to the time and expense required to properly 
integrate new products into their operations."
"As a result, if we are unable to be 
the first to develop and supply new products, our competitive position may 
suffer, resulting in a material adverse effect on our sales and results of 
operations."
"The time and expense needed to obtain regulatory approval and 
respond to changes in regulatory requirements could adversely 
affect our ability to commercially distribute our products and 
generate sales."
"We and our customers operate in a highly regulated environment characterized 
by frequent changes in the governing regulatory framework."
"As a result of this debate, some key countries may increase or 
establish regulatory barriers, which could adversely affect demand for our 
products and prevent us from fulfilling our growth expectations."
"Furthermore, 
there can be no assurance that any future changes in applicable regulations 
will not require further expenditures or an alteration, suspension or liquidation 
of our operations in certain areas, or even in their entirety."
"Changes in the existing regulations or adoption of new requirements or policies 
could adversely affect our ability to sell our approved or cleared products, or to 
seek approvals for new products in other countries around the world."
"and regulatory 
agencies in other countries."
"If we are not able to meet the applicable 
requirements, we will not be able to commercialize our products and tests, 
which will have a material adverse effect on our business."
"Several of our key products and programs are medical devices that are subject 
to extensive regulation by the FDA under the U.S."
"Food, Drug and Cosmetic 
Act."
"We plan to apply for FDA clearance or approval of additional products in 
the future."
"Regulatory agencies in other countries also have medical device and 
in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVD) approval requirements that are 
becoming more extensive."
"These regulations govern most commercial activities 
associated with medical devices, including indications for the use of these 
products as well as other aspects that include product development, testing, 
manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion."
Compliance with these regulations is expensive and time-consuming.
"Our cleared or approved devices, including diagnostic tests and related 
equipment, are subject to numerous post-approval requirements."
"We are subject 
to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our 
compliance with regulatory requirements."
"Any enforcement action by the FDA may affect our ability to 
commercially distribute these products in the U.S."
Some of our products are sold for research purposes in the U.S.
We are subject to risks associated with patent litigation.
"The biotechnology industry has been characterized by extensive litigation 
regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly since 
industry competitors gravitate around common technology platforms."
"We are 
aware that patents have been applied for and/or issued to third parties

claiming technologies for sample and assay technologies that are closely 
related to those we use."
"From time to time, we receive inquiries requesting 
confirmation that we do not infringe patents of third parties."
"We endeavor to 
follow developments in this field, and we do not believe that our technologies 
or products infringe any proprietary rights of third parties."
"However, there can 
be no assurance that third parties will not challenge our activities or, if so 
challenged, that we will prevail."
"In addition, the patent and proprietary rights 
of others could require that we alter our products or processes, pay licensing 
fees or cease certain activities, and there can be no assurance that we will be 
able to license any technologies that we may require on acceptable terms."
"In 
addition, litigation, including proceedings that may be declared by the U.S."
"Patent and Trademark Office or the International Trade Commission, may be 
necessary to respond to any assertions of infringement, enforce our patent 
rights and/or determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those 
of third parties."
"Litigation, or threatened litigation, could involve substantial 
cost, and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any proceedings."
"We rely on collaborative commercial relationships to develop 
and/or market some of our products."
"Our long-term business strategy involves entering into strategic alliances as well 
as marketing and distribution arrangements with academic, corporate and 
other partners relating to the development, commercialization, marketing and 
distribution of certain of our existing and potential products."
"We may be unable 
to continue to negotiate these collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, 
and these relationships also may not be scientifically or commercially 
successful."
"In addition, we may be unable to maintain these relationships, and 
our collaborative partners may pursue or develop competing products or 
technologies, either on their own or in collaboration with others."
"Our Precision Diagnostics business includes projects with pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies to co-develop companion diagnostics paired with 
drugs that those companies either market currently or are developing for future 
use."
"In addition, the future level of sales for companion diagnostics 
depends to a high degree on the commercial success of the related medicines 
for which the tests have been designed."
"More companion diagnostics would be 
sold in combination with a widely prescribed drug than one with limited use."
"The successful marketing of QIAGEN products, in some cases, depends on 
commercial relationships such as joint ventures or distributorships, particularly 
in emerging markets where we partner with local companies to augment our 
less-established commercial relationships and infrastructure."
"The continued 
commitment of our partners to these ventures, as well as the management of the 
commercial efforts, could influence QIAGEN's sales and profitability in these 
markets."
"We have made investments in and are expanding our business 
into growth markets, which exposes us to risks."
"Our top six emerging growth markets are Brazil, China, India, South Korea, 
Mexico, and Türkiye, which together accounted in 2023 for 12% of total sales."
"Russia was removed as a top growth market in 2022 following the invasion of 
Ukraine and the subsequent decision to suspend business operations in Russia 
and Belarus, which made up less than 1% of total sales."
"We expect to continue 
to focus on expanding our business in these or other fast-growing markets, 
including those in the Middle East and Asia."
"In addition to the currency and 
operating risks described above, our international operations are subject to a 
variety of risks arising from the economy, political outlook, language and 
cultural barriers in countries where we have operations or do business."
"In many 
of these emerging markets, we may face several risks that are more significant 
than in other countries where we have a history of doing business."
"In conducting our business, we move products from one 
country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary 
located in another country."
"Accordingly, we are vulnerable to abrupt changes

in customs and tax regimes that could have significant negative impacts on our 
results of operations."
"Some of our customers are requiring us to change our sales 
arrangements to lower their costs, and this may limit our pricing 
flexibility and harm our business."
"Some of our customers have developed purchasing initiatives to reduce the 
number of vendors from which they purchase products in order to lower their 
supply costs."
"In some cases, these customers have established agreements with 
large distributors, which include discounts and direct involvement in the 
distributor’s purchasing process."
"These activities may force us to supply large 
distributors with our products at discounts in order to continue providing 
products to some customers."
"For similar reasons, many larger customers, 
including the U.S."
"federal government, have requested, and may request in the 
future, special pricing arrangements, which can include blanket purchase 
agreements."
"These agreements may limit our pricing flexibility, which could 
harm our business and affect our results of operations."
"For a limited number of 
customers, and at the request of customers, we have conducted sales 
transactions through distribution and other value-added partners."
"If sales grow 
through these intermediaries, this could adversely impact our results of 
operations, in particular our gross profit."
"Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our business and 
operating results."
"Given that we currently market our products throughout the world, a significant 
portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S."
"dollar, our 
reporting currency."
"As a result, fluctuations in value relative to the U.S."
"dollar of 
the currencies in which we conduct our business have caused and will continue 
to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses."
"Foreign currency 
transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are 
charged against earnings in the period when incurred."
"Due to the number of 
currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential 
volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effects of future 
exchange rate fluctuations."
"As of April 1, 2022, the results of operations from 
our subsidiary in Türkiye have been reported under highly inflationary 
accounting as the prior three-years cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%."
"While we may engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage 
our foreign currency exposure, there can be no assurance that our hedging 
strategy will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of future 
exchange rate fluctuations."
"Our success depends on the continued employment of qualified 
personnel, any of whom we may lose at any time."
"Although we have not experienced any difficulties attracting or retaining 
management and scientific staff, our ability to recruit and retain qualified, 
skilled employees will continue to be critical to our success."
"Given the intense 
competition for experienced scientists and managers among pharmaceutical 
and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and other research 
institutions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain 
employees critical to our success on acceptable terms."
"Initiatives to expand 
QIAGEN will also require additional employees, including management with 
expertise in areas such as research and development, manufacturing, 
digitization, sales and marketing, and the development of existing managers to 
lead a growing organization."
"The failure to recruit and retain qualified 
employees, or develop existing employees, could have a material adverse 
impact on our results of operations."
"Our ability to accurately forecast our results during each quarter 
may be negatively impacted by the fact that at times a high 
percentage of our sales may be recorded in the final weeks or 
days of the quarter."
"In the markets we serve, a high percentage of purchase orders can be received 
in the final few weeks or days of each quarter."
"Although this varies from quarter 
to quarter, many customers make a large portion of their purchase decisions 
late in each quarter, in particular because they receive new information during 
this period on their budgets and requirements."
"Additionally, volatility in the 
timing of revenue from companion diagnostic partnerships can be difficult to 
predict."
"As a result, even late in each quarter, we cannot predict with certainty 
whether our sales forecasts for the quarter will be achieved."
"However, if customer 
purchasing trends during a quarter vary from historical patterns, as may occur 
with changes in market and economic conditions, our quarterly financial results 
could deviate significantly from our projections."
"As a result, our sales forecasts 
for any given quarter may prove not to be accurate."
"We also may not have 
sufficient, timely information to confirm or revise our sales projections for a 
specific quarter."
"If we fail to achieve our forecasted sales for a particular 
quarter, the value of our Common Shares could be significantly affected."
"We have a significant amount of debt that may adversely affect 
our financial condition and flexibility."
"We have a significant amount of debt, debt service obligations and restrictive 
covenants imposed by our lenders."
"A high level of indebtedness increases the 
risk that we may default on our debt obligations, and restrictive covenants may 
prevent us from borrowing additional funds."
"There is no assurance that we will 
be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt and 
comply with our debt covenants, or that future working capital, borrowings or 
equity financing will be available to repay or refinance our debt."
"If we are 
unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt and 
comply with our debt covenants, we may have to delay or curtail our research 
and development programs."
"Our business may require substantial additional capital, which 
we may not be able to obtain on terms acceptable to us, if at all."
"We currently anticipate that our short-term capital requirements will be satisfied 
by cash flow from our operations and/or cash on hand."
"As of December 31, 
2023, we had outstanding long-term debt of $1.5 billion, of which 
$588.0 million was current."
We may choose to refinance these liabilities.
"If at some point in time our existing resources should be insufficient to fund our 
activities, we may need to raise funds through public or private debt or equity 
financings."
"The funds for the refinancing of existing liabilities or for the ongoing 
funding of our business may not be available or, if available, not on terms 
acceptable to us."
"If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to 
reduce or delay expenditures for research and development, production, 
marketing, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, which could have a 
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations."
"To the extent 
that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible 
securities, the issuance of any securities could result in dilution to our 
shareholders."
"We will settle any conversions of the Cash Convertible Notes described under 
the heading “Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” 
elsewhere in this Annual Report, entirely in cash."
"Accordingly, the conversion 
option that is part of the Cash Convertible Notes is accounted for as a 
derivative pursuant to accounting standards relating to derivative instruments 
and hedging activities."
"Refer to Note 14 ""Derivatives and Hedging"" and Note 
16 ""Debt"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
"In general, this 
resulted in an initial valuation of the conversion option separate from the debt 
component of the Cash Convertible Notes, resulting in an original issue 
discount."
"The original issue discount will be accreted to interest expense over 
the term of the Cash Convertible Notes, which will result in an effective interest 
rate reported in our financial statements significantly in excess of the stated 
coupon rates of the Cash Convertible Notes."
"This accounting treatment will 
reduce our earnings."
"For each financial statement period after the issuance of 
the Cash Convertible Notes, a gain (or loss) will be reported in our financial 
statements to the extent the valuation of the conversion option changes from the 
previous period."
"The Call Options issued in connection with the Cash 
Convertible Notes will also be accounted for as derivative instruments, 
substantially offsetting the gain (or loss) associated with changes to the 
valuation of the conversion option."
"This may result in increased volatility to our 
results of operations."
"The cash convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we 
entered into in connection with the issuance of our Cash 
Convertible Notes may not provide the benefits we anticipate, 
and may have a dilutive effect on our common stock."
"Concurrently with the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, we entered into 
Call Options and issued Warrants."
"We entered into the Call Options with the 
expectation that they would offset potential cash payments by us in excess of 
the principal amount of the Cash Convertible Notes upon conversion of the 
Cash Convertible Notes."
"In the event that the hedge counter-parties fail to 
deliver potential cash payments to us, as required under the Call Options, we 
would not receive the benefit of such transaction."
"Separately, we also issued 
Warrants."
"The Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent 
that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the 
terms of the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants."
"An impairment of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce 
our earnings."
"At December 31, 2023, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $2.5 billion 
of goodwill and $526.8 million of intangible assets."
"Goodwill is recorded 
when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair value of the tangible 
and separately measurable intangible net assets."
"generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) require us to test goodwill for impairment on an 
annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill 
might be impaired."
"Long-lived assets, such as intangible assets with finite useful 
lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable."
"The 
impairment review often cannot be done at the level of the individual asset and 
it must instead be applied to a group of assets."
"For the purpose of our annual 
goodwill impairment testing based on the current circumstances of how we 
manage our business, this group of assets is the Company as a whole."
"If we 
determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets were impaired, we will 
be required to take an immediate charge to earnings and our results of 
operations could be adversely affected."
Our strategic equity investments may result in losses.
"We have made, and may continue to make, strategic investments in businesses 
as opportunities arise."
"We periodically review the carrying value of these 
investments for impairment, considering factors that include the most recent 
stock transactions, book values from the most recent financial statements, and 
forecasts and expectations of the investee."
"The results of these valuations may 
fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no 
control."

Estimating the fair value of non-marketable equity investments in life science 
companies is inherently subjective."
"If actual events differ from our assumptions 
and unfavorable fluctuations in the valuations of the investments are indicated, 
we could be required to write down the investment."
"This could result in future 
charges on our earnings that could materially have an adverse effect on our 
results of operations."
"It is uncertain whether or not we will realize any long-term 
benefits from these strategic investments."
Doing business internationally creates certain risks.
Our business involves operations in several countries around the world.
"Our 
consumables manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, China, Spain 
and the U.S."
"We source raw materials and subcomponents to manufacture our 
products from different countries."
"We have established sales subsidiaries in 
numerous countries."
"In addition, our products are sold through independent 
distributors serving more than 60 countries."
"Conducting and launching 
operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities 
across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant 
management resources."
"We have invested heavily in computerized information 
systems in order to manage more efficiently the widely dispersed components of 
our operations."
"Worldwide, we currently use SAP R/3 software to integrate 
most of our operating subsidiaries and are currently undergoing a multi-year 
implementation of S/4HANA."
"If we fail to coordinate and manage these 
activities effectively, or if we face a loss of information or the non-availability of 
any system, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected."
"Other risks associated with 
international operations include import and export licensing requirements, 
climate change legislation, exchange controls and changes in freight rates, as 
may occur as a result of rising energy costs."
"Further, any misuse or other 
wrongful use of our products could expose us to negative publicity resulting in 
reputation or brand damage with customers or partners."
"As a result of these 
conditions, an inability to successfully manage our international operations 
could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations."
"In any of the markets in which we do business, increasing attention to 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may result in new or 
expanded legal or regulatory requirements or expectations specific to ESG 
matters."
"A failure to meet investor or other stakeholder expectations may result 
in adverse reputation impacts, loss of business or a negative impact to attract 
and retain talent."
"Further, working to adhere to any new or expanded legal or 
regulatory requirements may require additional investments which could 
negatively impact our profitability."
"Unethical behavior and non-compliance with laws by our sales 
representatives, other employees, consultants, commercial 
partners or distributors or employees could seriously harm our 
business."
"Our operations include doing business in countries with a history of corruption 
and involve transactions with foreign governments."
"These factors may increase 
the risks associated with our international activities."
We are subject to the U.S.
"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K."
"Bribery Act and other laws that 
prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and 
their officials and political parties by business entities for the purpose of 
obtaining or retaining business."
"We have operations, agreements with third 
parties and sales in countries known to experience corruption."
"Further 
international expansion may involve increased exposure to these types of 
practices."
"Our policy is to implement safeguards to discourage these or other unethical 
practices by our employees and distributors, including online and in-person 
employee trainings, periodic internal audits, and standard reviews of our 
distributors."
"However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements

may not prove to be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or 
distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible."
"Violations of the FCPA and other laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, 
which could be severe, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could 
negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."
"Real or perceived defects in or misuse of our products could 
adversely affect our results of operations, growth prospects and 
reputation."
"We currently market our products in over 130 countries either directly or 
indirectly through commercial partners and distributors."
"Due to the size and 
breadth of our operations, we may not always be able to track the use of our 
products by the end users."
"If our products are misused or are perceived to be 
misused, this could adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ 
willingness to buy from us, and adversely affect market acceptance or 
perception of our products."
"Many of our customers - especially those in law enforcement and government 
who use our products for forensic testing, human identification, food testing or 
other purposes - use our products in applications that are of public interest or 
critical to their businesses or missions."
"As a result, they may have a lower risk 
tolerance to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical 
products."
"A defect in or misuse of any of our products by our law enforcement 
customers could lead to interference with the administration of justice, such as 
damage to forensic evidence."
"Any defects or misuse, real or perceived, could 
cause us to lose sales opportunities, increase our service costs, incur 
replacement costs, cause reputational damage, lose customers or subject us to 
liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks."
"Any one of 
these factors could materially and adversely affect our business and results of 
operations."
"In addition, our products could be perceived as ineffective for 
reasons outside of our control."
"Additionally, if any of our customers, government or otherwise, use or are 
perceived to use our products in a manner that is unethical, unlawful or 
inconsistent with our values, this may damage our reputation and results of 
operations."
"We strive to ensure that our products are used only in ethical and 
lawful ways, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will not be subject 
to claims from third parties alleging that our products were misused."
"Any 
allegations of misuse by our customers or third parties may damage our 
reputation, even if we took no part in the misuse or take immediate action to 
sever ties with such customers."
We believe that our brand and reputation are critical to driving our business.
"Building our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide top-
tier service, including high quality products at appropriate price points, which 
we may not do successfully."
"Negative reviews or publicity about our products 
or business, especially on media outlets, could harm our reputation and 
diminish our ability to make additional sales, which would adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, and results of operations."
"We depend on patents and proprietary rights that may fail to 
protect our business."
"Our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary 
products and technologies and to establish and protect our patent and 
trademark rights in these products and technologies."
"As of December 31, 
2023, we owned 303 issued patents in the United States, 251 issued patents 
in Germany and 1,716 issued patents in other major industrialized countries."
"In 
addition, as of December 31, 2023, we had 360 pending patent applications, 
and we intend to file applications for additional patents as our products and 
technologies are developed."
"The patent positions of technology-based 
companies involve complex legal and factual questions and may be uncertain, 
and the laws governing the scope of patent coverage and the periods of 
enforceability of patent protection are subject to change."
"In addition, patent 
applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until patents issue, 
and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag 
behind actual discoveries by several months."
"Therefore, no assurance can be 
given that patents will issue from any patent applications that we own or 
license, or if patents do issue, that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad 
to protect our technology."
"In addition, no assurance can be given that any 
issued patents that we own or license will not be challenged, invalidated or 
circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us competitive

advantages."
"Further, as issued patents expire, we may lose some competitive 
advantage as others develop competing products and as a result, we may lose 
revenue."
"Some of our products incorporate patents and technologies that are licensed 
from third parties and for certain products, these in-licensed patents together 
with other patents provide us with a competitive advantage."
"These licenses 
impose various commercialization, sub-licensing and other obligations on us."
"Our failure to comply with these requirements could result in the conversion of 
the applicable license from being exclusive to non-exclusive or, in some cases, 
termination of the license, and as a result, we may lose some competitive 
advantage and experience a loss of revenue."
"We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to 
protect through confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants."
"There can also be no assurance that our trade secrets will not 
otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors."
"We currently engage in, and may continue to engage in, collaborations with 
academic researchers and institutions."
"There can be no assurance that under 
the terms of such collaborations, third parties will not acquire rights in certain 
inventions developed during the course of these collaborations."
Our business exposes us to potential product liability.
"The marketing and sale of our products and services for certain applications 
entail a potential risk of product liability."
"Although we are not currently subject 
to any material product liability claims, product liability claims may be brought 
against us in the future."
"Further, there can be no assurance that our products 
will not be included in unethical, illegal or inappropriate research or 
applications, which may in turn put us at risk of litigation."
"We carry product 
liability insurance coverage, which is limited in scope and amount."
"There can 
be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this insurance at a reasonable 
cost and on reasonable terms, or that this insurance will be adequate to protect 
us against any or all potential claims or losses."
"We are subject to various laws and regulations generally applicable to 
businesses in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and 
regulations applicable to the handling and disposal of hazardous substances."
"The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be 
completely eliminated."
"In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable 
for any damages that result, and any such liability could have a material 
adverse impact on us."
"Our operating results may vary significantly from period to 
period and this may affect the market price of our Common 
Shares."
"Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations 
as to future sales trends."
"As a result, sales and earnings may vary significantly 
from quarter to quarter or from year to year, and actual sales and earnings 
results in any one period will not necessarily be indicative of results to be 
anticipated in subsequent periods."
"Our results may also fail to meet or exceed 
the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause a decline 
in the market price of our Common Shares."
"Our holding company structure makes us dependent on the 
operations of our subsidiaries."
"is incorporated under Dutch law as a public limited liability 
company (naamloze vennootschap), and is organized as a holding company."
"Currently, the material assets are the outstanding shares of the QIAGEN 
subsidiaries, intercompany receivables and other financial assets such as cash,

dependent upon payments, dividends and distributions from the subsidiaries for

dividends or distributions, if any, to holders of our Common Shares."
"Dividends 
or distributions by subsidiaries in a currency other than the U.S."
"dollar may 
result in a loss upon a subsequent conversion into U.S."
Our Common Shares may have a volatile public trading price.
"The market price of our Common Shares since our initial public offering in 
September 1996 has increased significantly and been highly volatile."
"Since 
January 10, 2018, our shares have been listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE)."
"Before that, our shares were listed on the NASDAQ through 
January 9, 2018."
"In the last two years, the price of our Common Shares has 
ranged from a high of $55.12 to a low of $34.74."
"On the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange our Common Shares have ranged from a high of €49.37 to a low of 
€32.74 during the last two years."
"The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and trading 
volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market for technology-
based companies."
"These fluctuations have not necessarily been related to the 
operating performance of these companies."
"These broad market fluctuations 
may adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares."
"Holders of our Common Shares should not expect to receive 
dividend income."
"QIAGEN has not paid an annual dividend since its inception, and does not 
intend to implement one at this time."
"However, in January 2017 and January 
2024 we completed synthetic share repurchases that combined direct capital 
repayments with reverse stock splits."
"Although we do not anticipate paying any 
cash dividends on a regular basis, the distribution of cash through another 
synthetic share repurchase in a currency other than the U.S."
"dollar will be 
subject to the risk of foreign currency transaction losses."
"Investors should not 
invest in our Common Shares if they are seeking dividend income; the only 
return that may be realized through investing in our Common Shares would be 
through an appreciation in the share price."
"Future sales and issuances of our Common Shares could 
adversely affect our stock price."
"Any future sale or issuance of a substantial number of our Common Shares in 
the public market, or any perception that a sale may occur, could adversely 
affect the market price of our Common Shares."
"Under Dutch law, a company 
can issue shares up to its authorized share capital provided for in its Articles of 
Association."
"Pursuant to our Articles of Association, our authorized share 
capital amounts to EUR 9.0 million, which is divided into 410.0 million 
common shares, 40.0 million financing preference shares and 450.0 million 
preference shares, with all shares having a EUR 0.01 par value."
"As of 
December 31, 2023, a total of approximately 228.2 million Common Shares 
were outstanding along with approximately 20.9 million Common Shares 
reserved under our stock plans as of December 31, 2023, including the shares 
subject to outstanding awards."
"Additionally, an aggregate of 17.1 million 
shares of Common Shares or up to a maximum of 27.0 million shares, subject 
to customary adjustments under certain circumstance, may be issued upon

"The majority of our outstanding Common 
Shares may be sold without restriction, except shares held by our affiliates, 
which are subject to certain limitations on resale."
"Shareholders who are United States residents could be subject to 
unfavorable tax treatment."
"We may be classified as a “passive foreign investment company”, or a PFIC, 
for U.S."
federal income tax purposes if certain tests are met.
"Our treatment as a 
PFIC could result in a reduction in the after-tax return to holders of Common 
Shares and would likely cause a reduction in the value of these shares."
"If we 
were determined to be a PFIC for U.S."
"federal income tax purposes, highly 
complex rules would apply to our U.S."
"We would be considered 
a PFIC with respect to a U.S."

"Based on our income, assets and activities, we do not believe that we were a 
PFIC for U.S."
"federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended 
December 31, 2023, and do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable 
year or any future taxable year."
"No assurances can be made, however, that 
the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge this position or that we will not 
subsequently become a PFIC."
"Provisions of our Articles of Association and Dutch law and an 
option we have granted may make it difficult to replace or 
remove management and may inhibit or delay a takeover."
"Our Articles of Association (Articles) provide that our shareholders may only 
suspend or dismiss our Managing Directors and Supervisory Directors against 
their wishes with a vote of two-thirds of the votes cast if such votes represent 
more than 50% of our issued share capital."
"If the proposal was made by the

majority is sufficient."
"Certain other provisions of our Articles allow us, under certain circumstances, to 
prevent a third party from obtaining a majority of the voting control of our 
Common Shares through the issuance of Preference Shares."
"If the Supervisory Board 
opposes an intended takeover and authorizes the issuance of Preference 
Shares, the bidder may withdraw its bid or enter into negotiations with the 
Managing Board and/or Supervisory Board and agree on a higher bid price 
for our Shares."
"In 2004, we granted an option to the Stichting Preferente Aandelen QIAGEN, 
or the Foundation (Stichting), subject to the conditions described in the 
paragraph above, which allows the Foundation to acquire Preference Shares 
from us."
"The option enables the Foundation to acquire such number of 
Preference Shares as equals the number of our outstanding Common Shares at 
the time of the relevant exercise of the option, less one Preference Share."
"When 
exercising the option and exercising its voting rights on these Preference 
Shares, the Foundation must act in our interest and the interests of our 
stakeholders."
"The purpose of the Foundation option is to prevent or delay a 
change of control that would not be in the best interests of our stakeholders."
"In 
addition, the holding period for these shares by the Foundation is restricted to 
QIAGEN N.V."

"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
Our future operating results may be affected by various risk factors, many of 
which are beyond our control."
"Certain statements included in this Annual Report 
and the documents incorporated herein by reference may be forward-looking 
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S."
"Securities Act of 
1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the U.S."
"Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended, including statements regarding potential future net sales, 
gross profit, net income and liquidity."
"These statements can be identified by the 
use of forward-looking terminology such as “believe”, “hope”, “plan”, “intend”, 
“seek”, “may”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “expect”, “anticipate”, 
“estimate”, “continue” or other similar words."
"Reference is made in particular to 
the description of our plans and objectives for future operations, assumptions 
underlying such plans and objectives, and other forward-looking statements."
"Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and are 
subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results 
to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements."
"We 
caution investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business 
conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such 
forward-looking statements as a result of various factors."
"Factors which could 
cause such results to differ materially from those described in the forward-
looking statements include those set forth in the risk factors above."
"As a result, 
our future success involves a high degree of risk."
"When considering forward-
looking statements, you should keep in mind that the risk factors could cause 
our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-
looking statement."
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About 
Market Risk
Derivatives and Hedging
In the ordinary course of business, we use derivative instruments, including 
swaps, forwards and / or options, to manage potential losses from foreign 
currency exposures and variable rate debt."
"The principal objective of such 
derivative instruments is to minimize the risks and / or costs associated with 
global financial and operating activities."
"We do not utilize derivative or other 
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes."
"We recognize all 
derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, measure those 
instruments at fair value and recognize the change in fair value in earnings in 
the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that 
offsets certain exposures."
"In determining fair value, we consider both the 
counterparty credit risk and our own creditworthiness, to the extent that the 
derivatives are not covered by collateral agreements with the respective 
counterparties."
"To determine our own credit risk, we estimated our own credit 
rating by benchmarking the price of our outstanding debt to publicly available 
comparable data from rated companies."
"Using the estimated rating, we 
quantify our credit risk by reference to publicly traded debt with a 
corresponding rating."
"Foreign Currency Derivatives
As a globally active enterprise, we are subject to risks associated with 
fluctuations in foreign currencies in our ordinary operations."
"This includes 
foreign currency-denominated receivables, payables, debt and other balance 
sheet positions including inter-company items."
"We manage our balance sheet 
exposure on a group-wide basis using foreign exchange forwards, options and 
cross-currency swaps."

Interest Rate Derivatives
We use interest rate derivative contracts on certain borrowing transactions to 
hedge interest rate exposures."
"We have previously entered into interest rate 
swaps in which we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference 
between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an 
agreed-upon notional principal amount."
We also make use of economic hedges.
"Further details of our derivative and 
hedging activities can be found in Note 14 ""Derivatives and Hedging"" in the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements."
"Our market risk relates primarily to interest rate exposures on cash, short-term 
investments and borrowings, and foreign currency exposures."
"Financial risk is 
centrally managed and is regulated by internal guidelines which require a 
continuous internal risk analysis."
"The overall objective of our risk management 
is to reduce the potential negative earnings effects from changes in interest and 
foreign exchange rates."
"Exposures are managed through operational methods 
and financial instruments relating to interest rate and foreign exchange risks."
"In 
the ordinary course of business, we use derivative instruments, including swaps, 
forwards and/or options, to manage potential losses from foreign currency 
exposures and interest rates."
"The principal objective of such derivative 
instruments is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with global 
financial and operating activities."
"We do not utilize derivative or other financial 
instruments for trading or other speculative purposes."
"All derivatives are 
recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and are measured 
at fair value with any change in fair value recognized in earnings in the period 
of change, unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets 
certain exposures."
"In determining fair value, we consider both the counterparty 
credit risk and our own creditworthiness, to the extent that the derivatives are 
not covered by collateral agreements with the respective counterparties."
"Further details of our derivative and hedging activities can be found in Note 14 
""Derivatives and Hedging"" in the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements."
"Interest Rate Risk
We use interest rate derivatives to align our portfolio of interest-bearing assets 
and liabilities with our risk management objectives."
"At December 31, 2023, we had $668.1 million in cash and cash equivalents 
as well as $389.7 million in short-term investments."
"Interest income earned on 
our cash investments is affected by changes in the relative levels of market 
interest rates."
We only invest in high-grade investment instruments.
"A 
hypothetical adverse 10% movement in market interest rates would have 
impacted our financial statements by approximately $5.7 million."
Borrowings against lines of credit are at variable interest rates.
"We had no 
amounts outstanding against our lines of credit at December 31, 2023."
"A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in market interest rates would not have 
materially impacted our financial statements."
"At December 31, 2023, we had $1.5 billion in long-term debt of which 
$245.5 million is floating interest rate debt."
"A hypothetical adverse 10% 
movement in market interest rates would not have materially impacted our 
financial statements, as the increased interest expense would have been 
completely offset by increased interest income from our variable rate financial 
assets."
"This includes foreign 
currency-denominated receivables, payables, debt and other balance sheet 
positions as well as future cash flows resulting from anticipated transactions 
including intra-group transactions."
"We manage our balance sheet exposure on 
a group-wide basis primarily using foreign exchange forward contracts, options 
and cross-currency swaps."
"Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions imposed in 
response have led to a decline in the value of the ruble which is expected to 
remain highly volatile."
"In 2022, we suspended our activities in Russia."
"As of 
April 1, 2022, the results of our subsidiary in Türkiye are reported under highly 
inflationary accounting as the prior three-years cumulative inflation rate 
exceeded 100 per cent."
"A significant portion of our revenues and expenses are earned and incurred in 
currencies other than the U.S."
"The euro is the most significant such 
currency, with others including the British pound, Chinese renminbi, Japanese 
yen, and Swiss franc."
"Fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we 
conduct our business relative to the U.S."
"dollar have caused and will continue 
to cause U.S."
"dollar translations of such currencies to vary from one period to 
another."
"Due to the number of currencies involved, the constantly changing 
currency exposures, and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange 
rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future 
operating results."
"In general terms, depreciation of the U.S."
"dollar against our 
other foreign currencies will increase reported net sales."
"However, this effect is, 
at least partially, offset by the fact that we also incur substantial expenses in 
foreign currencies."
"We have significant production and manufacturing facilities located in 
Germany and inter-company sales of inventory also expose us to foreign 
currency exchange rate risk."
"Inter-company sales of inventory are generally 
denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary purchasing the inventory in 
order to centralize foreign currency risk with the manufacturing subsidiary."
"We 
use an in-house bank approach to net and settle inter-company payables and 
receivables, as well as inter-company foreign exchanged swaps and forward 
contracts in order to centralize the foreign exchange rate risk to the extent 
possible."
"We have entered in the past and may enter in the future into foreign 
exchange derivatives including forwards, swaps and options to manage the 
remaining foreign exchange exposure."
"Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk 
are cash and cash equivalents, financial assets, and accounts receivable."
"We 
attempt to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and financial 
assets by dealing with highly rated financial institutions, and investing in a 
broad and diverse range of financial instruments."
"We have established guidelines related to credit quality and maturities of 
investments intended to maintain safety and liquidity."
"Concentration of credit 
risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to a large and diverse 
customer base, which is dispersed over different geographic areas."
"Allowances 
are maintained for potential credit losses and such losses have historically been 
within expected ranges."
"There were no significant concentrations of credit risk 
during the reporting period."
"The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented 
by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial 
position."
"Credit risk is managed on a Company basis, except for credit risk relating to 
accounts receivable balances."
"Each local entity is responsible for managing 
and analyzing the credit risk for each of their new clients before standard 
payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered."
"To the extent that derivatives are 
not subject to mutual collateralization agreements, we attempt to minimize this 
risk by limiting the counterparties to a diverse group of highly rated 
international financial institutions."
"The carrying values of our financial instruments incorporate the non-
performance risk by using market pricing for credit risk."
"However, we have no reason to believe that any counterparties will default on 
their obligations and therefore do not expect to record any losses as a result of 
counterparty default."
"In order to minimize our exposure with any single 
counterparty, we have entered into all derivative agreements, with the 
exception of the Call Spread Overlay, under master agreements which allow us 
to manage the exposure with the respective counterparty on a net basis."
"Most 
of these master agreements include bilateral collateral agreements."
"Commodities
We have exposure to price risk related to anticipated purchases of certain 
commodities used as raw materials in our business."
"A change in commodity prices may alter the gross margin, but due to the 
limited exposure to any single raw material, a price change is unlikely to have 
a material unforeseen impact on earnings."
"However, the volatility in product availability and pricing continued in 2023, 
and we expect some level of market constraints to continue in 2024."
"Our products are used to 
advance science and improve outcomes for patients around the world."
"We are 
committed to being a sustainable business and consider the views of our 
stakeholders – customers, employees, authorities, regulators, suppliers, and 
shareholders – in how we operate."
"Through initiatives such as reducing plastics 
and developing products with a lower environmental impact, we uphold our 
commitment to sustainability throughout our business activities and product 
lifecycle."
"Details about our business, operating environment and products are 
included in the section Business and Operating Environment."
"Building a sustainable business
Since 2017, we have focused on integrating sustainability throughout the entire 
value chain and aligning our vision with a sustainable business which includes 
reducing our impact on the environment and minimizing the carbon footprint of 
our products."
"Our products are used to 
advance science and improve outcomes for patients around the world."
"This is 
underscored by our vision of “making improvements in life possible”, which 
extends to our commitment of being a sustainable business ensuring that we do 
not negatively impact our environment, community or society as a whole."
"We 
take into consideration the views of our stakeholders in making decisions on the 
way to operate our business."
"Our approach to sustainability is to consider our 
actual or potential positive and negative impacts throughout each area of our 
business."
"In line with our vision of making improvements in life possible, we 
have a commitment to deliver the best possible portfolio of product and services 
while leaving the smallest possible footprint on our planet."
"From whom we 
source to how we produce, we approach each step with the intention to do so 
in a sustainable way."
"We know our people are our most critical asset and we 
care about them - from their working environment to career development and 
opportunity."
"We aim to attract and retain talents that contribute to our vibrant 
workforce and our culture of empowerment."
"Sustainability anchored in two-tier corporate governance 
structure
The Nomination & Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Committee, a 
dedicated Supervisory Board Committee, oversees the strategy, development 
and performance measurements of our sustainability initiatives."
"The strength of 
the committee lies in the extensive leadership experience of its current members, 
as each one of them has served as either the CEO or CFO of publicly listed 
companies."
"The Nomination & ESG Committee 
reviews the operational activities of the Corporate ESG Committee, a cross-
functional team with representatives from across the Company."
"The Corporate 
ESG Committee is led by our Head of ESG Strategy & Impacts Programs under 
the supervision of the Executive Committee."
"This Committee formulates and 
secures approval for our sustainability strategy and actively drives its 
implementation throughout the year."
"Additionally, a key responsibility of the 
Corporate ESG Committee is to inform the Audit Committee and Nomination & 
ESG Committee about new or updated regulatory requirements, such as the 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the EU Taxonomy and the 
German Supply Chain Act."
"In October 2023, the Corporate ESG Committee 
conducted a regulatory update with the Audit and Nomination & ESG 
Committees and instructed attendees on the relevant requirements from these 
three upcoming regulations."
"This update served to equip the Supervisory Board 
with the necessary information to guide their role in overseeing the effectiveness 
of internal controls and the risk management system pertaining to sustainability 
reporting."
"The Executive Committee receives updates on the progress of the 
implementation of the sustainability strategy and on regulatory changes on a 
quarterly basis while the Supervisory Board is informed of these updates at least 
twice a year."
"In 2023, the Corporate ESG Committee met with the Nomination 
& ESG Committee twice to review and approve the sustainability strategy and 
the implementation plan, including reporting."
"The significance of sustainability within QIAGEN is firmly embedded in our 
culture and linked through the compensation system, wherein ESG objectives 
are incorporated into the annual Team Goals."
"These goals serve as the 
foundation for a substantial portion of variable short-term incentive 
compensation for our global workforce and the Managing Board."
"In 
acknowledgment of the paramount importance of sustainability, we have 
elevated the weight and influence of these objectives in line with our 
sustainability aspirations, a commitment that aligns with our broader promises 
on ESG matters."
"Risk management and internal controls over sustainability 
reporting
Our risk management approach is discussed under section Risks and Risk 
Management."
"To ensure that newly established sustainability topics are 
integrated into the risk management approach, specialized teams were 
collaboratively formed in 2023 comprised of representatives from the owners of 
material topics and the ESG Reporting team."
"These teams included experts from 
global functions such as Accounting, ESG, U.S."
"Securities Exchange 
Commission (SEC) Reporting, and Corporate Communications."
"During the 
2023 reporting process, provided guidance by these teams on process 
requirements was applied by all owners of material topics and documented 
accordingly, including applicable reviews."
"The Sustainability reporting has also been aligned with the 
guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and has been prepared in 
accordance with the GRI Standards."
"We also take into account the relevant 
requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for the 
Medical Equipment & Supplies industry."
"Where possible, we follow the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD)."

Committed to the Sustainable Development Goals
As a global company, QIAGEN supports the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) of the United Nations (UN)."
"The SDGs identify starting points for policy-
makers, businesses and private individuals worldwide to tackle the major 
challenges of our time - from resource consumption and global inequality to 
climate change."
"We are aware of this responsibility and want to make an impactful contribution 
to the SDGs that can be influenced by our business activities."
"Validation of Carbon Emissions Targets
Our carbon emissions targets have now been validated by the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi), endorsing our ambition to honor the Paris Agreement’s 
climate goals."
"The SBTi is a global body that enables companies to set ambitious emissions 
reductions targets in line with the latest climate science."
"The initiative is a 
collaboration between the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United Nations 
Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide 
Fund for Nature (WWF), and one of the We Mean Business Coalition 
commitments."
"The SBTi defines and promotes best practice in science-based 
target setting, offers resources and guidance to reduce barriers to adoption, 
and independently assesses and approves companies’ targets."
"We are seeking 
to achieve net-zero status by 2050 by cutting direct and indirect emissions 
throughout our operations."
"We disclose our strategy to meet our targets in the 
Environment chapter under the section Minimize Carbon Footprint."
"Our Material Topics
In 2023, we focused on reviewing the material topics of our last materiality 
analysis conducted in 2022 and on aligning them with upcoming European 
regulatory requirements induced by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD)."
"We assessed actual and potential impacts as well as financial 
risks and opportunities in relation to the management of QIAGEN´s material 
topics."
"This restructuring served to enhance the coordination of 
individual topics under the oversight of global leaders appointed for each 
material aspect."
"These leaders assume responsibility for both crafting the 
strategy and translating it into tangible metrics, collaborating closely with their 
designated teams."
"In a series of subsequent workshops, and in conjunction with 
specialist departments, these global leaders conducted a thorough analysis of 
the maturity levels associated with each material topic."
"This analysis laid the 
foundation for the meticulous development of concrete roadmaps and action 
plans geared towards attaining our sustainability objectives and ensuring 
compliance with regulatory mandates."
"This strategic approach reflects our 
commitment to a comprehensive and systematic advancement in meeting our 
sustainability goals."
"In 2023, under the newly organized focus, the Corporate 
ESG Committee maintained this commitment by reviewing action plans and 
prioritizing the nature and extent of the work depending on the maturity level of 
a material topic."
"Examples of this work included efforts to establish or enhance 
their management approach for handling identified risks."
"Additionally, they 
undertook actions such as finalizing the documentation of related processes 
and policies including formalizing standard operating procedures."
"The maturity 
of the material topics will be reviewed on an annual basis and revalidated 
against current sustainability regulations and their implications for our 
sustainability strategy and governance."

Stakeholder engagement
We regard dialogue with our stakeholders as a central element in our 
development and the achievement of our long-term vision."
"We are aware that 
the shift toward a more sustainable economy and society requires intensive 
dialogue and cooperation with various stakeholder groups."
"We welcome this 
engagement and see these discussions as a way to identify important trends 
and developments in society and in our business fields."
"We take the outcomes 
of these discussions into account when shaping our business strategy as well as 
our sustainability agenda and objectives."
"Engaging with the financial community is an essential aspect of our growth 
strategy."
"Creating a solid relationship with investors and analysts enables us to 
build trust and transparency, fostering understanding and dialogue while 
enhancing credibility."
"We regularly communicate and provide financial 
updates, host investor calls, and attend a series of conferences and industry 
events each year."
"These discussions include operational topics as well as 
opportunities to discuss our ESG strategy, access to healthcare and corporate 
governance topics."
"These activities can help attract and retain investors, 
maintain an active market for our stock, and ultimately support our long-term 
success."
"In 2023, we took strides in fostering collaboration with our suppliers to develop 
a joint strategy aimed at realizing our climate commitments."
"As part of this 
process, we performed a maturity assessment of our suppliers to identify their 
environmental ambitions."
"The maturity assessment included a letter of our 
sustainability commitment from our Head of Global Procurement and a detailed 
questionnaire around the suppliers' ability to measure their emissions and meet 
environmental standards."
"We also included an information package on our 
SBTi commitment and our connected goals, together with the result of our 
analysis on the suppliers' current maturity level."
"Furthermore, we conducted 
Q&A sessions during strategic review meetings with suppliers."
"The results of the 
maturity assessments were used to derive an action plan for 2024 with the goal 
to jointly define a plan to further develop ambitious climate-connected 
commitments and achievements."
"Additionally, a risk assessment was initiated 
internally that extends beyond our environmental goals, encompassing human 
rights considerations."
"We formally integrated our ESG strategy with the 
publication of a new Supplier Code of Conduct in February 2023."
"The new 
Code of Conduct expresses our expectations towards our suppliers and its 
rollout was followed by a partner letter sent in April 2023 by our Head of 
Procurement, encouraging our suppliers to jointly work on our goals for climate 
action."
"Read more in the Governance chapter under section Sustainable 
Procurement."
"In June 2023, we engaged with our customers to identify best practices for 
more sustainability in research, opting to cover this topic in one of our live Q-
rious shows."
"This digital format involves information sharing through live video 
presentation and moderation and discussions in live chats."
"In this episode, we 
discussed practical eco-friendlier lab practices; options to reduce waste – from 
packing to products; understanding the ‘Environmental Impact Factor Label’, 
and what sustainability means to us as scientists striving to be experts in 
sustainability."
"Internally, our volunteer-led employee communities actively engaged to promote 
diversity and inclusion through a series of events and activities during the year."
"In October 2023, a panel discussion was held on “Thriving in the workplace 
with disabilities” to provide insight and guidance how to navigate work and life 
with mental health challenges and invisible disabilities."
"In December 2023, an 
event was held allowing discussions around indigenous Americans, and how 
QIAGEN is supporting initiatives to end violence against tribal women."
"This 
was accompanied by Orange Day awareness events in December at some of 
our sites, as well as in-person and virtual events on International Women´s Day."
"The 
response to the assessment of our ESG performance yielded a score of nearly 4 
on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, where 5 represents the highest evaluation."
"This 
metric serves to provide a robust benchmark, allowing us to systematically 
collect and incorporate valuable insights into our ESG activities shared by our 
employees."
"By standardizing and documenting this feedback, we aim to further 
enhance the effectiveness and transparency of our ESG initiatives."

"The SBTi has assessed our near-term and net-zero targets 
against the SBTi's Net-Zero Standard Criteria and the SBTi Near-Term Target 
Criteria and Recommendations (Version 5)."
"The SBTi target validation team has 
classified QIAGEN's Scope 1 and 2 target ambition and has determined that it 
is in line with a 1.5°C trajectory."
"Our approved targets are:
• Overall Net-Zero Target: We commit to reach net-zero greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHG) across the value chain by 2050 from a 2020 base year."
"• Near-Term Targets: We commit to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions 42% by 2030 from a 2020 base year."
"We also commit to 
reducing our absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel, use of 
sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products by 25% within the 
same timeframe."
"We further commit that 67% of our suppliers by emissions 
covering purchased goods and services, capital goods and upstream 
transportation and distribution will have science-based targets by 2027."
"• Long-Term Targets: We commit to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG 
emissions 90% by 2050 from a 2020 base year."
"After analyzing GHG emissions from key assets and products (locked-in GHG 
emissions), we found that our product disposal minimally contributes to Scope 3 
emissions, and emissions from product use represent an insignificant amount of 
the total."
"With potential natural gas consumption reduction through heat pumps 
and green electricity use, we determined that locked-in GHG emissions are not 
significant, posing no hindrance to our carbon roadmap or SBTi target 
achievement."

"Chaired by the Head of ESG Strategy & Impact Programs, the Climate Working 
Group reports progress quarterly to the Executive Committee and semi-annually 
to the Nomination & ESG Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"To proactively manage climate-related risks and their financial implications, 
we've incorporated climate impacts into our existing risk management structure, 
engaging QIAGEN internal key stakeholders throughout the organization."
"In 
2022, a thorough physical climate risk assessment was conducted for 13 key 
locations, prioritized by revenue or spending share."
"Results, reviewed in early 
2023 and approved by senior management, revealed no materialized physical 
climate risks."
"Our voluntary annual reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) was rated with an improved score from B- in 2022 to B in 2023."
"Transition risk assessment, involving Emerging Regulation, Reputation, Market, 
Legal, and Technology, engaged the same stakeholders."
"The top two potential 
transition risks — reduced investment in green technology and slow adoption of 
modern technology — were identified."
"In 2023, we analyzed strategic 
implications and calculated abatement costs for Scope 1, 2, and 3, aligning 
this information with financial planning for energy-reduction projects."
"While we currently do not integrate internal CO2 pricing into financial 
planning, our analysis suggests no imminent transition risks."
"In the coming 
months, we plan to refine our approach, transitioning from initial estimates to 
more precise expense calculations, enabling a reassessment of our stance on 
transition risks in 2024."
"Management of Scope 1 and 2 emissions
Our Carbon Reduction Roadmap (CRM) targets a 42% cut in carbon emissions 
by 2030, focusing on Scope 1 and 2 emissions as published at 
www.qiagen.com/sustainability."
"Key measures include transitioning 
from gas to green electricity and using Energy Attributed Certificates (EAC)."
"The 
CRM prioritizes our major manufacturing sites in Germany and the U.S., which 
contributed approximately 60% of related Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2023."
"To help achieve this, we've developed a tool to model changes in EAC 
availability."
"The installation of a wood pellet burner and heat pumps at our 
largest manufacturing site in Hilden, Germany, will significantly contribute to 
our carbon reduction projects."
"At our Germantown, Maryland site in the U.S., 
several Building Management System programs have been improved in order

Collaborating with suppliers was crucial in meeting greenhouse gas reduction 
targets."
"Ongoing partnerships in 2024 aim to identify low-carbon materials 
and effective recycling solutions, reinforcing our commitment to sustainability."
"Status 2023
In 2023, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have decreased by 15% or 3,156 
tCO2e compared to 2022 as a result of expanded usage of green energy and 
relating Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) in the United States and China."
"Our total Scope 3 emissions increased by around 4% (13,053 tCO2e) in 2023 
over the year-ago period."
"As part of our continuous improvement process, comparison period results for 
scope 1 & 2 and certain scope 3 emissions have been adjusted to align with 
improved measurements and calculation methods applied in 2023."
"The amount of our global spend of purchased goods and services (Scope 3.1) 
in 2023 was almost equal to 2022."
"However, we elected to refine our 
matching of suppliers to the spend-based emission factors as released by the 
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS)."
"This refinement 
of classification led to updated emission distributions and, upon application, to 
an overall increase of Scope 3.1 emissions by almost 9%."
"This increase was 
partially offset by emission declines derived from Scope 3.4 (Transportation 
and distribution) and Scope 3.5 (Waste in operations)."
"The carbon emissions 
within Scope 3.4 decreased in 2023 by 15% compared to 2022 and was 
driven by a decline of the total chargeable weight in 2023, in combination 
with changes in transportation routes."
"Our carbon emissions related to Scope 
3.5 (Waste in operations) declined by 59% in 2023."
"The decrease is due to 
improved reporting processes for waste volumes at several production sites."
"Our total corporate carbon footprint for 2023 amounts to 351,424 tCO2e, 
which is +2.9% or 9,897 tCO2e above the same period a year ago of 
341,527 tCO2e."
"Scope 3.11 and Scope 3.12 emissions categories have been modified to apply 
improved measurements and calculation methods for current year reporting and 
the prior year comparative period."
"Use phase of sold products emissions 
reported in Scope 3.11 are now better reflected through a metric that captures 
the volume of global instrumentation equipment sold."
"Emissions from end of life 
treatment of sold products, reported in Scope 3.12, are now more robustly 
aligned to underlying sales information included in our internal reporting data 
queries."

Methodology
Overall, we apply the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards as 
outlined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) for the GHG 
emissions reporting."
"Hence, the consolidated GHG emissions include all 
emissions from subsidiaries where QIAGEN has financial control."
"Scope 1 covers direct Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion 
of fossil fuels on the QIAGEN premises and by company vehicles."
"Scope 2 covers indirect GHG emissions originating from the external 
generation of electricity for our operational and business activities."
"They are 
reported using both a location-based and market-based approach."
"A market-
based calculation method for Scope 2 emissions reflects emissions calculated 
with the energy source mix used by each of our sites and is our first priority."
"A 
location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which 
energy consumption occurs and is only made when market-based is not 
available."
"As sustainability reporting, including emissions, will be subject to mandatory 
limited assurance beginning in 2024, we engaged an independent audit firm 
to conduct a limited assurance review for Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the 
2023 reporting year in advance of the formal regulatory requirement."
"The 
assurance engagement was performed in accordance with the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410 “Assurance on Greenhouse 
Gas Statements” as issued by the International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (IAASB)."
"Scope 3 covers upstream and downstream emissions that occur along our value 
chain."
"The sub-categories are reported separately in the table Corporate 
Carbon Footprint by Emissions Category shown above."
"To assist and inform our preparedness for the upcoming regulatory requirement 
of a limited assurance, in 2023, an independent audit firm confirmed our audit 
readiness of our processes for Scope 3 emissions."
"We have considered emissions in the following categories as material to our 
operations: Scopes 3.1."
"(purchased goods and services), 3.3."
"(energy-related 
activities), 3.4."
"(upstream and downstream transportation and distribution), 3.5."
"(waste in operations), 3.6."
"(employee commuting), 3.11."
(use phase of sold products) and 3.12.
(end of life treatment of sold products).
"The energy data used to calculate Scope 1 and 2 emissions is shown in the 
Energy Consumption by Source table below."

Energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency is a key part of our climate strategy and essential 
to meeting our SBTi target."
"We selected energy efficiency measures based on 
the Carbon Roadmap."
"During 2023, we continued our energy efficiency campaign to create 
awareness for and understanding of our energy efficiency priorities."
"This 
campaign provided guidance on how all employees could contribute to our 
climate goals and identify creative solutions for energy efficiencies across the 
company, beyond facility improvements."
"Use of renewable energy
In 2023, our energy attribute certificates (EACs) purchased in 2022 remained 
valid for Hilden, Germany and Germantown, Maryland."
"They are sourced from 
unspecified renewable electricity."
"Our sites in Sweden and in the Netherlands 
source their EACs from hydroelectric and wind turbines."
"Further we have 
expanded the usage of green energy in the United States and China by 
purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to offset relating emissions in 
these regions."
"We will also transition other offices to renewable energy 
according to our CRM."
"In total, we use 84% of our purchased electricity from 
renewable sources."
"In addition to renewable energy certificates, the solar panels on the roof at our 
manufacturing site in Hilden produced 58 MWh in 2023 for our own 
operations and reduced our reliance on the electricity grid."
"We use the GHG intensity 
ratio, which looks at the amount of emissions (in tons carbon dioxide 
equivalent) in relation to our total net sales (in USD millions)."
"In 2023, we have 
reduced the GHG intensity by 7.8% compared to the prior year."
"Electric company cars and employee commuting
In line with our emissions reduction strategy, we started to transition our fleet of 
company cars in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland, and Austria to use hybrid or 
wherever possible electric vehicles in 2022."
"During 2023, car fleet used for 
field services have been equipped with hybrid cars."
"For other areas electrical 
cars have been considered as a company car only."
The Benelux region and U.K.
"will transition to hybrid or electric vehicles in 
2024."
"facilities, employees are offered incentives to select hybrids 
and electric vehicles through an increased car allowance and a subsidized at-
home electric charger."
"We continue to expanding the necessary infrastructure 
for electric vehicles for employee use at our manufacturing site in Hilden, 
Germany."
"Many facilities provide discounted train and bus tickets to encourage 
employees to use public transportation."
"At our sites in Shenzhen, China, and 
Manila, Philippines, we offer bus shuttles to public transport stations."
"In Hilden, 
Germany and Manchester, U.K., we support commuting by subsidizing public 
transportation costs."
"In Hilden, an electric bike program was initiated to offer 
employees an alternative option of transportation."
"To curtail the adverse environmental impact 
caused by plastic in transport, packaging and products, we adopted a “reduce 
– replace – recycle” strategy."
"In addition to enhancing environmental 
protection, our decision to minimize our use of plastic can provide greater 
autonomy, alleviating the risk exposure of higher costs due to plastic tax or 
regulatory changes."
"Our customers and shareholders expect us to invest in 
alternative material and act in harmony with long-term future-oriented and 
environmentally conscious solutions."
"We rely on our global cross-functional 
plastic footprint reduction team to identify opportunities to diminish plastic and 
explore more environmentally friendly alternative materials."
"In 2023, we continued to follow up on our ambitious corporate goal to reduce 
plastic in transportation packaging materials and achieved our reduction goal 
of 7% compared to 2022."
"This was realized by eliminating, reducing and 
replacing plastic with paper, cardboard or sustainable materials."
"Key initiatives 
in 2023 included further replacing packaging materials with sustainable 
alternatives and reducing the amount of plastic material."
"We invested in new 
winding equipment for pallet wrapping within our distribution hubs in Europe 
and the U.S."
and drastically reduced the amount of stretch foil.
"In 2023, 
aligned with our strategy, we continued the roll-out of eco-friendly transport 
boxes in the U.S."
"and EMEA, replacing expanded polystyrene (EPS) transport 
boxes with cold chain shipments."
"In addition, we continue to consider the role 
of coordinating logistic processes and increasing the number of bulk shipments 
to further reduce our use of plastics."
"In 2024, we aim to further reduce plastic by 20t by expanding our plastic 
reduction strategy “reduce – replace – recycle” beyond our QIAwave product 
line into other products."
"Our project teams are working on the reduction of the 
thickness of primary plastic product packaging materials within the kits while 
other project teams have implemented paper-based product packaging 
alternatives."
"We are also preparing a pilot project where we will step into the 
use of bio-based plastic from renewal feedstock for some dedicated product 
parts."
"We are optimistic that the benefits of this alternative plastic will be a 
good option for our products and anticipate using the outcomes of this project 
to decide on the extent of future use."
"In addition, we encourage our employees to act as drivers of increased 
sustainable awareness and to serve as a source for the creation of new ideas to 
reduce our reliance on plastic."
"The ""Sustainable Teams“ voluntarily established 
across multiple sites have contributed toward our goals by successfully 
completing projects with the target of reducing operational waste at our sites."
"With the aim to reduce plastics in our products, we launched the eco-friendlier 
product line QIAwave in January 2022."
"In September 2023, we subsequently 
expanded its product range with additional kit variants for the simultaneous 
purification of DNA and RNA from cells and tissues, as well as RNA isolation 
with effective gDNA removal and kit sizes."
"The five QIAwave kits deliver the 
same high-quality genomic and plasmid DNA and RNA but produce less plastic 
and cardboard waste compared to our RNeasy Mini, RNeasy Plus Mini, 
DNeasy Blood & Tissue, AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini and QIAprep Spin Miniprep 
Kits."
"The QIAwave kits feature fewer components, waste tubes made from 
100% recycled plastic and buffer concentrates in smaller bottles."
"More compact

kits and new packaging methods reduce the amount of cardboard needed, and 
instructions for use are available online in lieu of printed materials."
"QIAwave 
marks the beginning of our journey to translate sustainability directly to our 
products, and we will continue to pursue other opportunities to transfer 
identified best practices to other product portfolios as well."
"The QIAwave Kits are the first sample preparation kits in our industry to receive 
the prestigious ACT (Accountability, Consistency, and Transparency) 
Environmental Impact Factor Label from My Green Lab."
"Our next development steps aim to reduce plastic further by re-
designing the spin columns and waste tubes."
"Circularity assessment for the QIAamp DNA mini Kit
A life cycle assessment (LCA) considers the environmental impact of the full life 
cycle of a product."
"This assessment considers the extraction and processing of 
raw materials, transport to the customer, the energy and material input required 
when using the product, transport to the disposal facility, and incineration of 
remaining materials."
"After an initial assessment in 2019, in 2021 we conducted an LCA with an 
increased scope in accordance with ISO 14040/14044 and certified by an 
independent third party (GUTcert)."
"The LCA reconfirmed the environmental 
impacts within the entire life cycle of a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, one of our best-
selling products, and one which is similar in composition and manufacturing 
process to other QIAGEN kits."
"The detailed report on the LCA can be found on 
our sustainability website."
"Based on the results, we received confirmation that plastic within our kits is the 
main contributor to our CO2 footprint."
"In 2023, we performed a further 
analysis of the amount and type of plastics contained in our top-selling products 
and additionally analyzed the circularity aspects of the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit 
in collaboration with an accredited external partner."
"This analysis was based 
on the Cradle to Cradle® Design Framework and revealed the potential to 
apply recycled or bio-based polyolefins (plastic components) as feedstock."
"After 
the use phase, the polyolefins are suitable for thermoplastic recycling and the 
paper and cardboard are suitable for municipal paper recycling."
"The results of 
the circularity assessment guide our journey to optimize Scope 3 emissions."
"With improved data, we are now able to measure the impact of reducing 
plastic and to prioritize our activities based on optimization potentials."
"Waste
Our operational waste is generated primarily from manufacturing, packaging 
and research activities conducted at our production sites."
"Proper management 
of waste is an essential part of our regulatory obligations and environmental 
permits."
"To ensure minimal environmental impact, our waste is handled and 
disposed of by approved waste disposal service providers."
"Our waste can be 
defined into two categories: non-hazardous and hazardous."
"Our production 
facilities have controls in place to manage hazardous waste to ensure that it is 
treated before disposal."
"Of the total waste in 2023, 31% was segregated for 
material recycling with the aim of reducing the volume of waste ending up in a 
landfill."
"As waste is managed locally at each site, some of our sites work with 
third-party Integrated Facility Management (IFM) partners to manage site waste."
"All waste produced in the course of our operations at our largest manufacturing 
facility in Hilden, Germany, is diverted from landfill and sent for alternative 
methods of disposal."
"Regarding product waste, we offer transport packaging, 
hazardous packaging and electrical/electronic equipment take-back options 
with approved collection agencies."
All water is withdrawn from third-party water utilities.
"The remaining water is 
used for cleaning, decontamination of production lines, sanitation and drinking 
water."
"In 2023, we used 136,701 megaliters of water (2022: 118,551 
megaliters), an increase of 15.3% compared to the previous year."
"Our two key 
manufacturing facilities (Hilden and Germantown) are located in low-risk water 
stress areas and comprise approximately 65% of our water use."
We did not identify water as a material ESG topic.
"However, we recognize 
water risks in some areas of our operations and aim to conduct a detailed 
water risk assessment in 2024."
"We currently identify water risk using the World 
Resource Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Tool."
"In 2023, 14% of water was withdrawn 
from areas classified as having medium-high, high, or extremely high water 
stress."
"In addition, approximately 50% of our sites are located in areas of 
medium-high, high, or extremely high water stress."
"We recognize the value in conservation of water and have taken steps to apply 
best practices."
"Existing measures to reduce water usage include using 
processed water – a by-product of manufacturing – to cool buildings."
"We have 
also installed hand-motion activated faucets, introduced low-flow plumbing, 
dual-flush toilets, and the use of rainwater to flush toilets."
"To achieve EHS business objectives to reduce environmental impacts, we ensure 
that the wastewater discharges comply with local and national standards."
"In 
2023, for the first time, we submitted our water-related qualitative and 
quantitative usage information to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)."
"As we 
look to integrate water conservation in our sustainability goals, we anticipate 
publicly reporting our water use and targets by the end of 2024."

communications are subject to an internal legal review via document controls 
before publishing."
"Safety along the value chain and evaluation of raw materials
We require our direct suppliers to comply with the conditions of the Supplier 
Code of Conduct."
"By working closely with our suppliers, we aim to ensure a 
high standard of chemical product safety along the entire value chain."
"Suppliers 
confirm their compliance with product-related statutory requirements by 
providing necessary certificates."
"During the early phases of product development and product implementation, 
every raw material and formulation is evaluated with regards to their safety and 
impact on human health or the environment."
"This assessment is done in 
accordance with the international standard under UN Model Regulation on 
GHS as well as local chemical legal requirements."
"If necessary, testing is done 
on our products to understand and identify any potential safety, health and 
environmental hazard."
"Raw materials are subject to ongoing regulatory reviews 
to ensure continual compliance with product safety."
"QIAGEN strives to reduce the use of substances of concern in products and has 
a procedure in place to support the efforts of reducing the use of substances of 
concern over a product's life cycle."
"Specifically, we maintain and reference a 
watch-list for “unwanted” chemical substances and prevent their use in product 
development."
"Customer Satisfaction
Management Approach
We are committed to continually improving our customers’ experiences, taking 
into account their evolving needs and expectations."
"Since our products extend 
across different market segments, our customers have some common 
overlapping needs but also hold market-specific expectations for the use of our 
products and services."
"We strive to exceed customer expectations and establish 
trustful relationships that translate into customer loyalty, allowing us to best 
market our current and developing product portfolio across an established, 
diverse set of customers."
"The 
NPS is a market research metric that measures customer satisfaction by asking 
customers to rate the likelihood that they would recommend a company or a 
specific product."
"Respective NPS values can range from -100, indicating all 
customers were detractors and dissatisfied, to +100, indicating all customers 
were promoters and satisfied."
"In 2023, we introduced a transactional Net Promoter Score (NPS-T) for 
customer care (ordering support) and tech service (technical product requests)."
"Upon completion of an interaction with a customer, we sent out requests to the 
respective NPS-T survey via email and solicited customer feedback on their 
experience."
"All collected customer feedback was directly accessible by local 
country managers."
"They analyzed the collected responses and followed up 
immediately with customers who indicated they were not fully satisfied with the 
resolution of their requests."
"Based on the feedback we received, in the future, 
we will offer enhanced customer service features."
"In 2024, we will launch our 
QIAGEN N.V."

we built a baseline for NPS-T Customer Care and we will set a minimum value 
target to be achieved for 2024 of 64."
"In 2023, we additionally initiated our first Net Promoter Score – Relationship 
(NPS-R) survey to collect information about the overall state of the relationship 
between our company and our customers."
"It was conducted in five languages 
and captured a diverse set of customers from all business areas."
"The feedback 
from this initial 2023 NPS-R global survey was predominantly positive, 
emphasizing our participants' confidence in our product and service quality."
"For example, customers acknowledged our efforts towards sustainability, saying 
they were pleased with changes in packaging and product configurations."
"There was a general desire for increased in-person interactions post-COVID-19, 
reflecting the willingness to return to the visible level of attention and care that 
prevailed before the pandemic."
"Customers also highlighted factors such as ease 
of doing business, effective remote customer support and product-specific 
features as contributing to a positive experience with QIAGEN and supporting 
their recurring business."
"We anticipate finalizing and analyzing the results of 
this assessment during 2024."

trainings for our sales force, with the goal of enhancing our abilities to 
understand customer needs, educate them about our solutions, and build lasting 
relationships."
"Through QIAlearn, we offer e-learning and instructor-led training 
courses to our sales professionals on various topics ranging from foundational 
knowledge to detailed product offerings."
"Our vision of Access to Healthcare is to ensure that every person 
who may benefit from a QIAGEN testing solution has access to one, regardless 
of where they live in the world and regardless of their economic status or 
background."
"As described in our Access to Healthcare policy, our Global Public 
Health Task Force (GPHTF) is the highest governing body, responsible for 
oversight of QIAGEN’s Access to Healthcare strategy and objectives, including 
allocation of resources and overseeing project expansion in crucial regions."
"The 
GPHTF is composed of a diverse population of employees, with representation 
from each sales region encompassing APAC, EMEA, and the Americas."
"It also 
integrates members from every functional domain in Molecular Diagnostics, Life 
Sciences, and QIAGEN Digital Insights."

Collaborations
We collaborate with public health laboratories, research and academic 
institutions around the world as part of our mission to enhance access to 
healthcare."
"Our role and contribution varies based on the project and may 
involve laboratory infrastructure and capacity building to support pandemic 
preparedness and response initiatives, local surveillance, and development of 
new tools for pathogen detection."
"One such collaboration launched in 2023 
involved working with the Pasteur Network and Institut Pasteur at two of their 
sites in Dakar, Senegal, and Bangui, Central African Republic."
"As part of the 
collaboration, we donated over 500 QIAstat-Dx panels for Meningitis/
Encephalitis and MPOX surveillance at Institut Pasteur Dakar, and continued 
supporting Institut Pasteur Bangui with ongoing MPOX research from kits 
previously donated in 2022."
"The project in Bangui focused on detection of 
MPOX Clade I, inaugurated during a visit of the Minister of Health and a 
World Health Organization (WHO) delegation."
"Launching the collaboration 
was no small feat, with meticulous planning for equipment deployment and 
training."
"In 2023, we expanded our support for a pilot project with the Malawi-Liverpool 
Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme for TB infection surveillance of 
pediatric populations."
"Additional QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus tests and

using whole blood."
"This malaria detection method has several advantages over 
conventional methods, including reduced dependence on skilled personnel, 
better performance at low parasitemia, and better handling of mixed infections 
and parasite mutations."
"Our collaborations with Institut Pasteur remain ongoing 
with the intention to further expand the collaboration to other sites within the 
Pasteur Network in 2024 and beyond."
"Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief
QIAGEN is committed to corporate social responsibility and believes in actively 
contributing to the communities we serve."

Ukraine, QIAGEN has supported the Public Health Centre of Ukraine, a 
division of the Ministry of Health, with multiple product donations to address 
healthcare challenges and disruption to healthcare services caused by the war."
"Our donation included QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus testing kits and 
instrumentation to diagnose Tuberculosis infections and control the spread of 
this deadly disease."
"The donation was coordinated through the United Nations 
Office for Project Services and the Global Drug Facility."
"To assist with the 
identification of missing persons and war crimes investigations, we provided a 
donation of human identification and forensic equipment to two public health 
laboratories in the country."
"In addition, working in collaboration with a non-
governmental organization in Ukraine called “We Stand,” we donated care 
HPV testing equipment and consumables to aid in the screening of HPV and the 
prevention of cervical cancer among women who have been displaced or 
affected by the ongoing war."
"On September 10, 2023, a massive storm caused widespread flooding and 
destruction in Libya."
"According to UNICEF, the flooding killed more than 4,300 
people with thousands more missing and displaced."
"To respond to the crisis, 
QIAGEN contacted representatives of the Libyan government and provided a 
donation of reagents and consumables to assist in the identification of missing 
persons and catalyze search and recovery efforts."
"In addition to product donations that support healthcare services and laboratory 
infrastructure, QIAGEN also provided financial contributions to local Red Cross 
and Red Crescent Societies in response to international disasters."
"During the 
course of 2023, QIAGEN organized two global employee donation drives to 
raise funds for relief efforts in response to the earthquakes in Türkiye, Syria and 
Morocco, and the tragedy in Libya."
"These campaigns raised over $124,000 
from employee donations and a QIAGEN contribution, which matched the 
employee donations dollar for dollar."

Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world’s leading infectious disease killers."
"In 
2021, more than 1.6 million people died and another 10.6 million people fell 
ill from the disease, according to the WHO."
"Recognizing this, for nearly two 
decades, QIAGEN has undertaken a global effort to advance diagnostics for 
TB in low-resource, high-disease burdened countries."
"Our QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) remains one of the most widely used 
tests for the detection of Tuberculosis with over 100 million tests distributed to 
over 130 countries around the world."
"We work closely with the World Health 
Organization, Stop TB Partnership Private Sector Constituency, and many other 
organizations involved in the fight to eliminate this deadly disease and raise 
awareness on the importance of TB infection testing in order to reach global 
elimination targets."
"In 2023, we participated in the 2nd United Nations General Assembly High 
Level Meeting on Tuberculosis, delivering testimony on the importance of early 
detection and prevention of infection by cutting off the source of TB disease 
before transmission can occur."
"The meeting culminated in the adoption of a 
Political Declaration whereby Member States committed to find and treat 45 
million people between 2023 and 2027 and mobilize an additional $5 billion 
annually by 2027 for TB research."
"QIAGEN’s support for TB infection testing 
will be instrumental in reaching these targets."
"In addition to supporting a global health movement, at the regional level, 
QIAGEN supported education and awareness for TB infection testing in rural 
First Nation indigenous communities in Canada and Alaska in 2023 through 
the QIAcommunities initiative."
"Since January 2023, QIAGEN has supported the 
Alaska Department of Health with numerous awareness-raising activities 
ranging from sponsoring free lunches and TB testing to podcasts and art 
contests for kids."
"In Canada, trainings were conducted for First Nation 
healthcare workers."
"Initial activities focused on Yukon and Northwest 
Territories, with plans to expand into Nunavut by the end of 2023 and into 
2024."
QIAGEN's commitment to aid in eradicating TB did not go unnoticed.
"In 2023, 
QIAGEN was recognized by the Treatment Action Group as one of the leading 
private sector funders of TB diagnostics research during 2022."
"Importantly, we 
are proud to renew our commitment to pediatric TB R&D and be recognized as 
one of three corporations in the private sector investing more than $500,000 in 
pediatric TB research in 2021."
"Children are often a neglected segment of this 
already neglected disease."
"The unique needs of children and adolescents 
require new tools and innovations, and QIAGEN is a leader in developing 
testing solutions suitable for this vulnerable population."
"Unethical behavior and non-compliance with 
laws and regulations has the potential to seriously harm our business, our 
reputation, our shareholders, and expose our employees to personal liability."
"We have established a comprehensive Compliance Program which is overseen 
by the Global Compliance Manager and the Compliance Committee, under the 
leadership of the Head of Global Legal Affairs and Compliance, who reports in 
this function directly to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"The 
Compliance Committee consists of managers from Legal, Internal Audit, Human 
Resources, SEC Reporting, Clinical and Medical Affairs, and Trade 
Compliance."
"The Compliance Committee is responsible for our Corporate Code of Conduct 
and Ethics, which is updated annually, supplements specific policies for our 
employees, and meets the requirements of the SEC and the NYSE Listed 
Company Manual."
"The Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics applies to all 
employees including the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, the 
principal accounting officer or controller, and other persons performing similar 
functions."
"The full text of our Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics can be 
found on our website, www.qiagen.com, on the Compliance page under

to employees via the intranet."
"Each policy includes a contact address and the 
invitation to comment or to ask questions."
"Moreover, we do not make or receive any payments to or from political parties 
or political action committees."

collaborate with global health policy institutions such as the World Health 
Organization and regional consortia, such as the African Society for 
Laboratory Medicine, to improve affordable access to testing solutions for 
neglected diseases in low-resource settings."
"Besides our engagement in industry 
associations, we are not active in any direct lobbying activities."
"Risk Management
We pay special attention to anti-trust and anti-corruption laws."
"Non-compliance 
with the related rules can expose QIAGEN and its involved employees to 
monetary and reputational damage and criminal charges."
"Conversely, 
compliant behavior will improve the trust in us held by our customers, 
employees and shareholders and enhance our reputation in the market."
"Our 
Compliance Committee annually analyzes related risks, including anti-
competitive practices."
The risk assessments are applied to the entire group.
"Furthermore, the Legal Department closely monitors the evolution of the law to 
adapt our policies and training courses, if needed."

as well as to secure the employment status of the complainant."
"We also offer a 
direct email and telephone hotline for employees to communicate questions or

revised Supplier Code of Conduct."
"Acceptance of this code is an integral part 
of our terms and conditions."
"All suppliers are requested to commit to QIAGEN’s 
Supplier Code of Conduct and to accept the human rights, environment and 
sustainability principles defined therein as a precondition for a contractual 
relationship with QIAGEN."
"Accepting our Purchase Orders is a confirmation of 
acknowledging our Code of Conduct."
"The revised QIAGEN Supplier Code of Conduct refers to numerous obligations, 
and it safeguards fundamental human rights."
"We expect our suppliers to commit to respect human rights and environmental 
protection, to establish appropriate due diligence processes, and to pass these 
principles on to their own suppliers."
"The Supplier Code of Conduct is available 
online on our website, along with the QIAGEN Procurement Policy."
"In alignment with the revision of the Supplier Code of Conduct, our internal 
procurement policy was updated in 2023."
"The policy applies to QIAGEN 
procurement activities globally and serves as the foundation to enable and 
ensure sustainable sourcing at QIAGEN."
"With respect to the revised Supplier Code of Conduct, 100% of employees 
working in procurement completed training."
"Our compliance training program 
ensures that employees in the procurement organization understand our existing 
guidelines and policies and comply with them."
The training is mandatory.
"Supply chain management
The Global Procurement Team, situated across several countries, assumes a 
pivotal role in overseeing acquisitions and expenditures in our production cycle 
and across various other business functions."
"It provides the required strategic 
overall direction and informational foundation and enables efficient and 
effective operational execution."
"This includes defining, developing and 
realizing all relevant category and supply base strategies to execute and 
support global procurement and sourcing activities."
"The team is tasked with 
driving cost savings, investigating innovation, supporting ESG initiatives, 
securing availability of products and services, and ensuring compliance within 
the category."
"Additionally it engages in spend, trend, and forecast analyses, and conducts 
quantitative reviews of price and market benchmarks."
"It also participates in the 
oversight and verification of the quality of procured goods and services by 
ensuring specifications adhere with business requirements."
"In 2023, we continued to navigate through supply chain interruptions in a 
disruptive supply landscape."
"We took action to hedge against our exposure by 
employing a combination of long-term agreements and alternative sourcing 
activities in the short and mid-term."
"Our ability to engage this adaptive strategy 
allowed us to navigate the challenges during the year posed by the dynamic 
and unpredictable nature of the supply environment."
"Due Diligence in the supply chain
Risk analysis
When working with suppliers, we apply a multi-stage selection process to 
minimize compliance, environmental and social risks in our supply chain."
"Suppliers are subject to a risk analysis covering environmental and social 
criteria based on their geographic location."
"To ensure the reliability of these 
criteria, we leverage information from reputable sources, including the MVO 
Netherlands platform, funded by the Dutch Foreign Ministry, and the 
Sustainable Development Goals Index in 2022 from the Bertelsmann Stiftung."
"Effective risk management enables us to perform an assessment of human rights 
and environmental risks in our operating business with greater comprehension 
and prioritization, resulting in more efficient identification and integration of 
main risk areas."
"Our subsidiary in Hilden, Germany is subject to the German Supply Chain Act 
(Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz or LkSG) as of January 1, 2024."
"The new 
law imposes extended due diligence requirements in the supply chain on 
QIAGEN."
"To effectively address the challenges of a sustainable supply chain 
and meet the regulatory requirements as well as our own ambitions, we refined 
our existing risk analysis and implemented various measures in 2023, including 
the establishment of a Human Rights Committee."
"Read more about its 
composition in the section Human Rights in this chapter."
"The risk analysis for 2023 reflected that no suppliers falling under the German 
Supply Chain Act pose potential risks based on their geographic location and 
their transactions with QIAGEN."
"Direct suppliers
As a general principle, our suppliers have to commit to our Supplier Code of 
Conduct and the embedded human rights and environmental principles, and to 
adhere to these principles in their supply chain."
"As part of this commitment, our 
direct suppliers are obliged to allow us to conduct audits."
"Each new supplier is required to complete a questionnaire that collects 
information on specific human rights and environmental risk, as well as aspects 
of safety, quality and cyber security."
"We plan to extend the questionnaire to 
existing suppliers during 2024 through an electronic survey administered by the 
cloud-based tool we use to onboard our suppliers."
"For registered suppliers, we 
regularly track potential incidents with media checks via the same system."
"The effectiveness of our prevention measures is reviewed by our Human Rights 
Committee annually, or on an ad hoc basis as needed."
"Supplier assessment and audits
We conduct comprehensive assessments as part of our supplier selection 
process."
"All direct strategic suppliers with a critical impact on the value of our 
supply undergo this assessment."
"Among other things, the assessment is based 
on the following criteria: quality management, future supply strategies, financial

stability, embargoes, and risks of natural disaster."
"In 2023, this process was 
adapted to leverage criteria in line with the evolving compliance regarding 
environmental and social risks."
"We collect the relevant data for the assessment 
via a submitted questionnaire or when assessing the suppliers directly on site 
during a visit."
"In 2024, we anticipate more than 20 site visits."
"If suppliers fail to 
fulfil all criteria, we reserve the right to refrain from future cooperation."
"For all direct suppliers that we define as critical, quality audits are conducted 
on site at least every three years on a case-by-case basis."
"We document all 
audit findings and share the results with the audited suppliers."
"In case of non-
conformity with quality processes, we deliver corrective actions to the supplier 
and continually follow-up until effective implementation adheres to expected 
quality standards."
"Beginning in 2024, ESG-related topics will be incorporated 
into procedures evaluating quality processes."
"For the onboarding of new suppliers, we use a cloud-based tool with automated 
and optimized due diligence processes."
"Moreover, we utilize this system to 
continuously monitor documentation data and performance-related criteria of 
registered suppliers, as well as to track the progress of the risk assessments."
"We 
anticipate that this tool will also help us achieve our supply chain-related 
climate target we have committed to under the SBTi, as discussed in the 
Environment chapter under Minimize Carbon Footprint."
"Preventive measures
Competency and awareness
In 2023, as will also be the case in 2024, ESG-related objectives were 
integrated into the personal goals of all procurement employees."
"Beginning in 
2024, new and mandatory employee training courses regarding sustainability 
and human rights in the supply chain were introduced."
"Furthermore, internal 
quality processes will be extended as Global Procurement will report on local 
environmental and human rights protection laws in connection with audits 
commencing in 2024."
"Partnerships with suppliers
In addition to assessments and audits, we engage in strategic partnerships with 
suppliers."
"In these partnerships, we work collaboratively on joint projects, 
events, training courses, and other shared commitments."
"In general, it is our 
goal to strengthen ongoing partnerships with our suppliers, for example by 
aligning our ecological and social goals."
"During our Strategic Supplier 
Meetings in 2023, we further intensified the cooperation with our suppliers by 
sharing our SBTi commitments and guidance on the emission reduction goals."
"In 
order to enable our suppliers to reduce their emissions as well, we analyzed 
their maturity levels and provided information packages or further direct 
communication."
"Our commitment to sourcing from suppliers having at least one 
environmental and one social goal reached 80% of our total spend in 2023."
"In 
2024, we aim to expand our reach and include more suppliers."
"Remedies
If we become aware of potential or actual violations and breaches of the LkSG 
or our Supplier Code of Conduct, communicated for example through the 
QIAintegrity Line, we will take immediate corrective action."
"In a first step, any 
report is anonymously forwarded to the Compliance Team, which then reviews 
the report with the appropriate teams."
"With regard to violations due to our own business operations, we will take 
remedial measures to correct identified violations and prevent future violations."
"In the case of (imminent) violations involving direct suppliers, we will develop a 
corrective action plan with the affected suppliers and monitor its 
implementation, provided that the business relationship is to be continued."
"In 
the case of indirect suppliers, in the event of substantiated knowledge of a 
(threatened) violation, we will develop a process for the prevention and 
termination of human rights or environmental violations, and ensure its 
implementation."
"We reserve the right to terminate a business relationship in accordance with the 
requirements of the LkSG, including in exceptional cases:
• serious violations of the law,
QIAGEN N.V."
"legislation has been enacted to improve transparency and accountability 
concerning the sourcing of conflict minerals from mines located in the conflict 
zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its adjoining countries."
"Conflict minerals comprise tantalum, tin, tungsten (or their ores) and gold."
"Certain of our instrumentation product components that we purchase from third 
party suppliers contain gold."
"legislation requires manufacturers, such 
as us, to investigate our supply chain and disclose if there is any use of conflict 
minerals originating in the DRC or adjoining countries."
"We conduct due 
diligence measures annually to determine the presence of conflict minerals in 
our products and the source of any such conflict minerals."
"Because we do not 
purchase conflict minerals directly from smelters or refineries, we rely on our 
suppliers to specify to us their conflict minerals sources and declare their conflict 
minerals status."
"We disclosed our most recent conflict minerals findings to the 
Securities Exchange Commission for the calendar year ending December 31, 
2022, on Form SD on May 30, 2023, and will provide updated disclosure to 
the Securities Exchange Commission as required."
"Human Rights
Respect for human rights is an essential component of promoting sustainability 
in our global business."
"As a publicly listed company with international 
operations, we regard ourselves as a responsible corporate citizen in all the 
countries and regions where we do business."
"This role includes rights and 
obligations governed by international and national law, with human rights as 
one of the foundational elements."
"Our Human Rights Policy is designed to 
provide guidance on all human rights issues in our sphere of influence, 
including our relationships with customers, employees and in our supply chain."
Our Human Rights Policy can be found on our sustainability webpage.
"Further, 
beginning in 2024, we published a General Declaration on our Human Rights 
Strategy in accordance with the German Due Diligence Supply Chain Act 
(QIAGEN compliance webpage)."
"Our 
subsidiaries in the U.K."
"Management of our human rights issues lie within different departments 
depending on the subject area, but may involve Legal Affairs and Compliance, 
Human Resources, Procurement, Sales and/or ESG."
"Our review of potential 
compliance matters with respect to human rights violations applies a risk-based 
approach."
"Our review takes into account that our global operations can be 
classified as based in either administrative, research and development, 
manufacturing or sales."
"None of these areas, including our manufacturing sites, 
allow for employment practices that violate human rights principles (such as 
child or slave labor)."
"Furthermore, local management is responsible for 
overseeing that all employees adhere to the observance of the principles set 
forth in our Code of Conduct and Ethics and our Human Rights Policy at all 
sites."
"In 2023, we established a Human Rights Committee."
"The Committee is 
comprised of the Vice President Procurement, the Head of ESG Strategy & 
Impacts Programs, and the Head of Legal Affairs and Compliance."
"It is 
responsible for ensuring the implementation of human rights due diligence 
measures."

practices."
"Our recently developed bioethics policy outlines our commitment to 
ethical integrity across all facets of our operations."
"Our established Bioethics 
Committee, led by the Chief Medical Officer, operates within the broader 
structure of the Compliance Committee."
"This arrangement ensures 
comprehensive ethical oversight, with regular meetings to review and update 
our policies in response to new ethical challenges and scientific advancements."
"The integration of our Bioethics Committee within the Compliance Committee 
ensures a comprehensive approach to ethical decision-making."
"This 
collaborative model fosters cross-functional dialogue and enhances our ability 
to effectively address complex ethical dilemmas."
"Our stakeholder engagement 
strategy involves regular dialogue with patients, healthcare providers, 
regulatory authorities, and other key stakeholders."
"This engagement helps us to 
refine our policies and practices, ensuring they are responsive to diverse 
perspectives and the evolving landscape of healthcare and diagnostics."
"Ethics in clinical studies
Clinical studies are essential to evaluate the performance and clinical value of 
our regulated clinical diagnostic tests."
"This information is required by regulatory 
authorities to gain marketing approval."
"More importantly, we are committed to 
bringing high performance products to the market, and this can only be 
achieved by establishing the performance characteristics of a potential product 
according to its intended use."
"Therefore, we and our partners conduct clinical 
studies for our diagnostics tests that are to be approved for use as in vitro 
diagnostics in a patient care pathway."
"In the conduct of these studies, we 
commit to ensuring the well-being, safety, ethical concerns, and legal rights of 
the study volunteers."
"All investigators and staff involved in studies must be suitably qualified for their 
role."
"They are required to have a current GCP certification (renewed 
biannually) which demonstrates training in the ethical conduct of clinical trials 
with human participants."
"Eligible studies must be approved by ethics 
committees or the Institutional Review Board prior to initiation, and if required, 
have the appropriate regulatory approvals from authorities in the country in 
which the study is being conducted."
"Study sites require proof of qualifications 
before participating in a study to ensure compliance with all relevant 
regulations, including financial disclosures and suitability of the principal 
investigator and site staff."
"Study master files are compiled to ensure full 
recording and monitoring of the study, which may be subject to audit by 
relevant authorities."
"We use residual (left-over) patient samples whenever possible in our studies, 
minimizing the need to actively collect new samples from patients."
"Where 
active participation by volunteers in studies is needed, we obtain informed 
consent by providing them with a comprehensive overview of the study 
including its risks and benefits and alternative options for the patient, in 
accordance with best practices."
"Appropriate guidelines, such as ISO 20916, Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute guidelines and direct feedback and guidance documents from 
regulatory authorities, are followed when designing QIAGEN clinical studies."
"This is to ensure the integrity of study design, adherence to sound scientific 
principles, and that high quality data are generated, while minimizing the risk 
to volunteers."
"Through our clinical and medical monitoring, we oversee study and patient 
risks and assess any adverse event or device event reports, which are then

appropriately reviewed and reported to authorities (e.g., FDA, European 
Competent Authorities, dependent on study location) when required."
"Personally identifiable data that we collect while conducting studies are kept 
confidential in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations."
"All 
volunteers are issued unique subject identification numbers to de-identify patient 
data, ensuring we meet the requirement for data privacy."
"For transparency and 
accessibility of clinical performance data of clinical diagnostic tests, we 
undertake to:
• register relevant studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov, a resource provided 
by the U.S."
"National Library of Medicine and,
• publish studies in peer-reviewed publications in an anonymized fashion."
"Ethical product use
We endorse the application of our products, our services, and our operations in 
compliance with human rights principles and codes such as the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights."
"Many of our products, such as DNA 
or RNA extraction kits, have an intended use for a broad range of research 
and diagnostic applications, including COVID-19, oncology testing and 
forensics."
"None of them are designed for population screening, but we 
acknowledge that it is technically possible to operate our products for this 
purpose."
"As per our Human Rights Policy, we do not tolerate the misuse of our 
products for purposes such as mass screening and surveillance of ethnic 
minorities, and we will block customers involved in such practices from further 
sales should this become known to us."
"However, as we operate via distributors 
in many countries, we have no means of monitoring the identity of all our end-
users of our products, nor can we control the use of our products by end 
customers."
"Following media reports about the use of DNA profiling technologies for the 
genetic surveillance of minorities in certain countries, we reviewed our 
commercialization channels in the identified countries and could not confirm 
that any such practices were performed with our products."
"To further mitigate this risk, we now require our distributors to sign distribution 
agreements requiring them to block end customers from further sales in the 
event they become aware of any misuse of our products as defined by our 
Human Rights Policy."
"Those amendments give us the legal leverage to terminate 
the respective distribution agreement if necessary."
"Animal testing
QIAGEN does not conduct any animal testing or related research activities."
"However, we procure raw materials for some of our products from suppliers 
that potentially may conduct animal testing and / or research as stated in 
CIoMS (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences)."
"Rules are 
in place within our Supplier Code of Conduct (available on our QIAGEN 
website) to ensure responsible actions."
"These rules request that suppliers 
conduct testing and research activities in line with the guidelines of international 
organizations such as the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of 
Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)."
"Ethical use of genetic editing
Genome editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 are revolutionizing life science 
research and have the potential to prevent and treat many diseases."
"Our 
solutions are used in almost every laboratory conducting CRISPR and other 
gene modification techniques."
"While such technologies can enable major 
advances in life science research, we truly appreciate the complex ethical 
considerations of using such technology, as well as the need for clear 
guidelines and policies."
"At QIAGEN, we fully support the careful development of guidelines by scientific 
and societal leaders, with involvement and transparency for diverse elements of 
society with a stake in the issue."
"Tight regulations and ethical rules about the 
use of genome editing are necessary to prevent misconduct and avoid harm to 
people and the ecosystem in which we live."
"We endorse the principles and 
proposals of scientific organizations and advisory groups that have issued 
cautionary guidelines, namely the American Society of Human Genetics and 
the European Society of Human Genetics."
"These leaders are asking for a fixed-
period ban on changing heritable human DNA (in sperm, eggs or embryos) to 
make genetically modified offspring."
"We strongly agree with the moratorium 
and require compliance according to our Human Rights Policy."
"All employees 
who become aware or have suspicions of customers using our products in a 
non-compliant manner in this field are required to notify our Head of Legal 
Affairs and Compliance in accordance with our policy on Ethical Issues in 
Gene Typing."
"Data and Cyber Security
Considering the increasingly challenging cyber threat landscape, the realities of 
a remote workforce and our steadily progressing digitalization efforts, cyber 
security remains an important topic for our organization."
"We have made 
investments to improve the cyber-resilience of our organization, products and 
services."
"Preserving the trust of our customers, partners and employees is our 
goal."
"Despite our security measures, the risk of data breaches remains."
"Potential 
incidents can have severe ramifications including financial loss, reputational 
damage, and legal penalties."
"Cyber-attacks, such as ransomware, can cause 
significant operational disruptions, impeding the timely delivery of services and 
products and potentially impacting our commitments to our stakeholders."
"We 
are aware that some of the data we are processing, if leaked, may harm the 
trust of the general public, our partners and customers."
"Our cyber security 
program, therefore, aims to implement robust measures ensuring the 
confidentiality, availability and integrity of critical data and services."
"Global cyber security and privacy requirements are 
actively monitored for and discussed as part of our Cyber Security Council as 
well as during Data Protection Committee meetings, both held multiple times a 
year."
"To facilitate information and knowledge exchange, QIAGEN has joined well-
known industry and governmental cyber security communities like the 
Information Security Forum (ISF), Allianz für Cyber-Sicherheit and Health-ISAC."
"Our Cyber Security Team consists of members with varying professional, 
educational, cultural and industry backgrounds, as well as a balanced mix of 
technical and managerial skills."
"We encourage and support our cyber security 
employees to further develop their skill set and participate in relevant security 
industry and community activities."
"Our cyber security program considers evolving business requirements, 
regulatory guidance, and emerging threats."
"We have supporting privacy and 
cyber security policies and guidelines in place, which are reviewed and 
approved as part of our Cyber Security Council and Compliance Committee 
procedures."
"These policies and guidelines are applicable to all employees and 
are available on our intranet."
"Furthermore, we offer employees mandatory 
training during which we carry out knowledge checks to ensure that the content 
was understood by the trainees."
QIAGEN has a high cyber security awareness culture.
"For our mandatory cyber 
security awareness training, we have, on average, approximately 85% of our 
staff worldwide successfully complete the training and we are actively working 
on increasing this completion rate further."
"We also conduct regular 'phishing' 
simulations, providing all staff members with an opportunity to interact in a safe 
manner with up-to-date phishing threats as observed from real threat actors."
"We 
offer frequent awareness webinars and workshops on important security topics, 
including new phishing trends, as well as role-specific trainings."
"In addition, the 
cyber security team regularly conducts incident response exercises to evaluate 
the organization's established procedures, including an analysis of each 
applicable incident response stage."
"We are monitoring our organization’s externally exposed assets and services 
(Attack Surface Monitoring), as well as information exposure (Dark Web 
Monitoring) to identify blind spots and potential weaknesses."

"We are working with Council for Registered 
Ethical Security Testers (CREST) certified partners to conduct regular, at least 
annual, security assessments of our global infrastructure."
"We further engage 
with external partners as needed to utilize their expertise for advanced security 
assessments."
"Cyber security risks are considered in the context of our Enterprise 
Risk Management."
"Tax
Tax accountability, governance and compliance
We are committed to conducting business lawfully, ethically, and with the 
highest degree of integrity."
"These fundamental values and principles are key to 
our long-term success and the basis of our tax strategy."
"Our tax strategy is 
firmly anchored within the company, being considered within our risk 
management, subject to management decisions, and reviewed with our 
Supervisory Board."
"Our tax strategy is embedded in the following guiding 
principles, reflecting our status as a listed company and the regulated nature of 
our business."
"Tax is part of our corporate governance and is supervised by the Managing 
Board."
"Our tax function is centrally managed and controlled by our Global Tax 
Department, which is part of the Global Finance organization."
"It is led by the 
Global Head of Tax, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer."
"Under the 
ultimate responsibility of our Audit Committee and Managing Board, the Chief 
Financial Officer regularly reviews, evaluates, approves and, where necessary, 
adjusts our approach to tax."
"Tax management
One of the basic principles for sustainable tax management is that taxes should 
be paid where economic value is generated."
"We allocate assets to the 
jurisdictions in which the underlying activities are performed, and risks are 
assumed."
"This ensures that the return on our business activities is allocated and 
taxed where they are actually performed."
"The volume of product and service 
that flows among entities within the company is significant, and the price of 
transactions among our entities is an important factor in our overall tax 
organization."
"Within Global Tax, our Transfer Pricing Team determines the 
policy for the pricing of such transactions based on a full analysis of the value 
drivers of our business, ensuring that international and local rules are followed."
"Our objective is that all entities are remunerated at “arm’s length”, in 
accordance with OECD guidelines and country-specific rules and regulations."
"The intellectual property related to our products, and also to marketing specific 
intangibles, are key profit drivers within QIAGEN, and profits generated with 
the employment of such assets are appropriately remunerated with the 
respective owner."
"The owner is the company controlling and taking the 
entrepreneurial risk of investing in the intellectual property."
"Our main 
entrepreneurs and intellectual property owners are companies in Germany and 
the U.S."
"We seek an open dialogue with our stakeholders, including relevant tax 
authorities, our shareholders, customers, business partners, employees, 
governments, regulators, NGOs, and the communities in which we operate."
"In 
some cases, QIAGEN and the respective tax authority may disagree on the 
correct application of local tax law."
"In the event of disputes, we collaborate 
with the respective tax authority in a fair and positive spirit to find balanced 
solutions in accordance with the applicable laws."
"We only use business structures that are driven by commercial considerations, 
are aligned with business activities, and have genuine substance."
"We do not 
operate in countries that are on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for 
tax purposes."
"Tax benefits
Like many companies, we seek to optimize our global tax position by accepting 
tax incentives."
"In doing so, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance 
between corporate, employee and shareholder interests, as well as public 
interest."
"We are committed to conducting business lawfully, ethically, and with 
the highest degree of integrity."
"We seek to comply with both the letter and the 
spirit of the relevant local and international tax laws and principles wherever 
we operate, and we anticipate paying tax on profits where our business

activities take place and added value is created."
"If possible and ethically 
appropriate, we apply for tax incentives and exemptions."
"Such tax incentive 
schemes relate to eligible research and development activities performed by 
QIAGEN."
"Compliance and relationships with tax authorities
We are committed to complying with the tax legislation of the countries in 
which we operate and create added value, and to paying the right amount of 
tax at the right time."
We strive for full and timely tax compliance.
"To minimize 
any tax compliance risk, a frequent review process is in place to secure timely 
and correct tax filings and tax payments."
"In the execution of tax compliance, 
third-party tax service providers are often involved under the supervision of the 
Global Tax Department."
"Transparency
Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) requires multinationals to report with 
aggregate data on the global allocation of income, profit, taxes paid, and 
economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which they operate."
"This requires 
QIAGEN N.V., the ultimate parent of the QIAGEN Group, to file an annual 
CbCR report to the Dutch taxing authorities."
"We provide in the following selected, aggregated information for the regions 
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), North and South America (Americas), 
and Asia Pacific, Japan and Rest of World (APAC)."
"We also provide more 
detailed information and reconciliation in accordance with the respective GRI 
standard in the Annex of this report."
The following information is based on U.S.
"generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which is underlying to the 
CbCR filing in the Netherlands."
"Financial assistance from governments
We recognize government grants when there is reasonable assurance that all 
conditions will be complied with and the grant will be received."
"Our 
government grants generally represent subsidies for specified research and 
development activities and are therefore recognized when earned as a 
reduction of the expenses recorded for the activity for which the grants are 
intended to compensate."
"Thus, when the grant relates to research and 
development expenses, the grant is recognized over the same period that the 
related costs are incurred."
"Otherwise, amounts received under government 
grants are recorded as liabilities in the statement of financial position."
"When 
the grant relates to an asset, the value of the grant is deducted from the 
carrying amount of the asset and recognized over the same period that the 
related asset is depreciated or amortized."
"In 2023, we received government grants in the amount of $4.4 million (2022: 
$2.4 million)."
"At December 31, 2023, we did not carry any liabilities related 
to government grants."
"Both institutions forecast growth in 2024 at around the same rate of 3.0% as 
the previous year, thanks to a combination of ongoing high interest rates and 
inflation, plus geopolitical uncertainty and instability in various parts of the 
world."
"Even as the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic waned in 2023, 
the sudden Israel-Palestine conflict in the Gaza Strip fueled fears of a wider war 
in the Middle East on top of the already intractable war in the Ukraine."
"China's 
claim on Taiwan also remains a constant worry."
"On the plus side, the U.S."
"economy showed signs of a revival in 2023, and 
analysts expect the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates over the course of the 
year."
This should not only boost the U.S.
"economy, but trigger central banks in 
Europe and Asia to follow suit."
"However, any such moves could depend on 
inflation continuing to fall, and no further geopolitical shocks that might disrupt 
supply chains or prompt a rise in energy prices."
"An escalation of the U.S.-China 
trade war can also not be ruled out, while the European Union has entered the 
year in a technical recession."
"The post-Brexit economic outlier that the United 
Kingdom has become, meanwhile, is forecast to post zero growth in 2024."
"Key 
elections there, in the U.S., and in India will also command the financial 
market's attention."
"On top of all this, China's economy continues to weaken, 
the burden of debt for developing countries may cause many to default on 
loans to China, the World Bank and the IMF, and climate-related disasters have 
become an inevitability, not just random 'natural' events."
"Nonetheless, if these 
factors can be navigated and inflation continues to decline in 2024, many 
economists expect improved growth across the world in 2025 if the stronger 
economies loosen monetary policy."
"Industry Perspectives for 2024
The life science and molecular diagnostics sectors will continue to be driven by 
innovation and technological advances, with industry forecasts expecting 
annual growth rates in the higher single digits up until the end of the decade."
"The burgeoning fields of precision medicine and gene editing, for example, 
have the potential to revolutionize diagnoses and the treatment of genetic 
diseases."
"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also expected to play an 
increasing role in the development and discovery of new drugs and therapies, 
while mobile apps and portable devices will break new ground collecting data 
and preventing disease."
"We aim to be at the forefront of this anticipated 
growth through our focused growth strategy, our differentiated product 
portfolio, and our strong global reach in emerging markets."
"QIAGEN Perspectives for 2024
QIAGEN announced an outlook for 2024 (as of February 2024) with 
expectations for solid sales growth in the second half 2024 in the non-COVID 
portfolio over the 2023 period."
"The outlook for sales is overall unchanged from 
2023, takes a prudent view on current macro trends and ongoing volatility in 
certain regions (e.g., China), while still expecting positive trends in a number of 
our end-markets."
"Consumables and related revenues are expected to drive 
growth, while larger-scale instrument sales remain challenging."
"Currency 
movements against the U.S."
"dollar are expected to have an overall neutral 
impact on full-year net sales, but a negative impact on EPS."
"Significant pressure 
is expected on non-operating income in 2024 due to anticipated lower interest 
income and a higher tax rate compared to 2023."
"Focus involves our Five 
Pillars of Growth strategy to make significant investments in the 
commercialization and development of (1) Sample technologies, (2) 
QuantiFERON, (3) QIAcuity, (4) NeuMoDx and (5) QIAstat-Dx."
"Balance 
involves developing our portfolio to address more than 500,000 customers 
across the Life Sciences and Molecular Diagnostics, as well as to build our 
presence in markets around the world offering growth potential."
"In terms of 
profitability, QIAGEN anticipates earnings per share (EPS) to be slightly above 
the 2023 level."
"The outlook provided by QIAGEN in February 2024 does not 
include any potential acquisitions that could be completed during the year."

Message from the Chair of the Supervisory Board
Dear Stakeholders,
2023 was a challenging as well as an encouraging year for QIAGEN."
"Geopolitical uncertainty, inflation and higher interest rates provided a volatile 
backdrop to our efforts to generate growth and move beyond the COVID-19 
pandemic."
"We are proud of the initiative and determination among our 6,000 employees 
– whom we call QIAGENers – to deliver solid sales growth in non-COVID 
product groups that was in the top tier among companies in our industry, even 
if the targets we had set ourselves were not fully achieved."

"Through our formal meetings and additional ad hoc meetings and events, we 
are closely involved in the development of the QIAGEN business."
"The following 
pages of this report provide detail on the areas of focus that we have 
concentrated on during the year."
"A focus area that I want to highlight here is our ESG strategy aimed at the long-
term sustainability and value creation in our business through the Environment, 
Social and Governance framework."
"Our Supervisory Board is pleased to see 
how sustainability and diversity are becoming truly embedded across QIAGEN, 
and a topic we review within the Nomination and ESG Committee that I chair, 
as well as through full Board sessions."

satisfaction and our ability to attract and retain top talent."
"Furthermore, we have engaged with shareholders in discussions about 
QIAGEN and on our long-term ambitions."
"The $300 million synthetic share 
repurchase completed in January 2024 underlines our confidence in the value 
creation opportunities for our shareholders and other stakeholders in the years 
to come."
"To improve insight and transparency in the governance of our company, we 
have restructured the order of presentation of the annual report."
"In the first 
section, the Management Board reports on the company performance."

second section we have concentrated our report on all aspects of governance."
"We feel this provides a fair reflection of the position and responsibilities of 
management and of our role in oversight, performance evaluation and advice."
"Strengthening our leadership 
Succession is essential in strengthening of QIAGEN’s leadership, in particular 
the process undertaken in recent years to further complement and enhance the 
Board’s extensive experience profile."

"Both Dr. van Pelt and Mr. van Meurs bring impressive track 
records in international healthcare industry management to QIAGEN along 
with other areas of expertise involving digitization."
"We believe these new 
appointments – including five new members since 2021 - contribute to our 
discussions, decision-making and our interactions with the Managing Board 
and senior management."
"Additionally, the Scientific Advisory Board comprised of renowned scientists 
under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Ross Levine from our Supervisory Board met 
during the year to support the early evaluation of market opportunities and 
technology developments for QIAGEN."

the outcome of these discussions, which have been critical to evaluating and 
prioritizing internal R&D activities, as well as evaluating external opportunities."
"2024 perspectives
As we move into 2024, the macro environment remains challenging amid a 
period of ongoing geopolitical instability in various regions."
"Across the world, 
central banks are seeking to tame inflation, and their progress has been varied."
"It will also be a year marked by elections in more than 60 countries and over 
40% of the world’s population."
"At the same time, as we have seen time and time again, challenges bring out 
the best in our QIAGENers."
"We are confident that our strategy will allow us to 
capture growth opportunities in attractive markets from a position of strength 
and anchored by our trusted QIAGEN brand."

"This section provides an overview of our corporate 
governance structure and includes details of the information required under the 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2022 (published at www.mccg.nl) (the 
Dutch Code)."
The Dutch Code is applicable to QIAGEN N.V.
"(in the following 
also referred to as QIAGEN or the Company), as it is a publicly listed company 
incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands with registered seat in Venlo, 
The Netherlands."
"The Dutch Code contains the principles and concrete 
provisions which the persons involved in a listed company (including Managing 
Board members and Supervisory Board members) and stakeholders should 
observe in relation to one another."
"QIAGEN is a ‘Naamloze Vennootschap,’ or N.V., a Dutch limited liability 
company similar to a corporation in the United States."
"We have a two-tier 
board structure under which QIAGEN is managed by a Managing Board 
consisting of executive management and acting under the supervision of an 
independent Supervisory Board (non-executives)."
"The Supervisory Board follows the principle of increasing stakeholder value and 
has always pursued the highest standards in Corporate Governance."
"QIAGEN is committed to ensuring a corporate governance structure that best 
suits its business and stakeholders, and that complies with relevant rules and 
regulations."
"A brief summary of the principal 
differences is presented in the section Dutch Corporate Governance Code -

Board-Related Matters
Diversity within the Managing Board and Supervisory Board
On January 1, 2022, a new Dutch gender diversity bill became effective."
"Accordingly, we have established gender balance targets that we consider 
appropriate and ambitious as follows:
• Our objective is for at least 40% of the Supervisory Board members to be 
women and at least 40% men in the mid-term."
"To achieve this goal, gender 
diversity is one of the key selection criteria for new members."
"As of 
December 31, 2023, the Supervisory Board was comprised of 37.5% 
women, and in early 2024, the Supervisory Board was expanded with 40% 
of the members being women."
"• Our current Managing Board consists of two members, the CEO and the 
CFO, who are ultimately accountable for the actions and decisions of 
QIAGEN."
"If there is a change of a current Managing Board member, an 
expansion in the number or a change in the governance structure, we will 
seek to have at least 30% women as members and at least 30% men."
"We 
will consider internal candidates from QIAGEN’s senior management who 
fulfill the desired profile for any open position or by defining selection criteria 
for new hires that include, among other factors, gender diversity."
"• In senior management, our goal is to have at least 40% women and 40% 
men in these roles in the mid-term."
"To achieve this goal, gender diversity is a 
goal that is part of our annual Team Goals, as well as a priority in our 
recruiting practices and talent development programs."
"As of December 31, 
2023, 36% of senior management roles were held by women, having 
increased from 28% in 2018."
"Although we are not subject to quota requirements for gender diversity within 
the Managing Board and Supervisory Board, we support the trend toward 
higher participation of women."
"At the same time, QIAGEN believes that gender 
is only one aspect of diversity and strives to ensure a diverse composition in 
terms of factors such as age, nationality, public reputation, industry or 
academic experience, etc."
"We are committed to increasing diversity while pursuing individuals for these 
Boards and senior management roles who offer a unique blend of scientific and 
commercial expertise combined with leadership capabilities that will contribute 
to the future success of QIAGEN."
"Management development programs support 
the career advancement of leaders regardless of gender and other factors."
"As a 
result, the number of women in key leadership roles, particularly in commercial 
and operational positions, has increased within QIAGEN in recent years."
"More information 
about diversity at QIAGEN can be found below under the section Dutch 
Corporate Governance Code - Comply or explain."
"Culture 
QIAGEN's culture is deeply embedded with a commitment to quality, ingenuity 
and accessibility - all aligned with our QIAGEN brand values - to help our 
customers advance science and improve outcomes for patients around the 
world."
"This commitment is reflected in our EMPOWER culture that seeks to empower 
employees to take ownership – with accountability – in making decisions in the 
best interests of QIAGEN, our customers and other stakeholders."
"This culture is additionally reflected in our approach to compensation in 
rewarding performance in terms of ""what"" goals are achieved as well as 
""how"" they are achieved in terms of our cultural aspirations."
"In 2023, neither QIAGEN nor any of its Supervisory Board members entered 
into any such transactions."
"No credit, loans or similar benefits were granted to members of the Managing 
Board or Supervisory Board."

composition of the Supervisory Board and the Managing Board."

2017/828)."
"Under Dutch law, the Supervisory Board will be required to submit 
a proposal to adopt a Remuneration Policy for the Managing Board no later 
than at the 2025 AGM."
"In addition, Managing Board members can receive deferred 
compensation contributions and other benefits in line with market practices."
"The Remuneration Policy complies with the best practices in Corporate 
Governance in the U.S."
"and Germany, where our shares are listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, respectively."
The inclusion of perspectives from the U.S.
"is particularly important given that 
this country is the domicile of many of our competitors, and for many members 
of our leadership and senior executive team, and also a country that represents 
more than 45% of our annual sales."
"The remuneration package for Managing Board members is designed to have a 
significant portion of total compensation in variable awards."
"The value of these 
awards can differ substantially from year to year depending on actual 
performance."

performance targets have a lower weight than those for long-term incentives,

including shareholders."

our website at www.qiagen.com."

Board will be required to submit a proposal to adopt a Remuneration Policy for

retain, and motivate highly qualified Board members, taking into account 
QIAGEN's mission and vision, as well as strategic initiatives and opportunities 
to create value for stakeholders, including shareholders."
"It focuses on achieving 
a total remuneration level, both short-term and long term, that is comparable 
with levels provided by other European and U.S.-based companies."
"This Policy supports the long-term development and strategy of QIAGEN in a 
highly dynamic environment, while aiming to address the requests of various 
stakeholders and maintaining an acceptable risk profile."
"It builds on 
remuneration principles and practices that have proven to be both fitting and 
effective for us, especially as a Dutch incorporated company with global 
operations, as well as stock market listings in the U.S."

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management."

Consolidated Financial Statements
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB."
"Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud."
"Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks."
"Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements."
"Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements."
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
"Assessment of unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company conducts its business globally and 
operates more than 50 consolidated subsidiaries in multiple tax jurisdictions."
"This multi-jurisdictional business operation 
involves complex intercompany operating and financing activities."
"The nature of these activities can result in 
uncertainties in the estimation of the related income tax exposures."
"The Company initially recognizes and subsequently 
measures the unrecognized tax benefit in its consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the 
position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Company 
recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $95.6 million."
We identified the assessment of unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter.
"Complex auditor judgment and 
specialized skills and knowledge were required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation and application of tax laws 
in the jurisdictions where it operates and its estimate of the resolution of the tax position."
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.
"We inspected the Company’s legal composition to identify and assess changes in operating

31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of

"Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit."
"We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
"Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects."
"Our audit also 
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances."
"We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion."
"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."

"Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements
The following new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) were adopted in 
2023, 2022 and 2021:
Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2023
No adoption of new accounting standards in 2023."
"Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2022
ASU 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, creates an exception 
to the recognition and measurement principles in ASC 805, Business Combinations."
"The amendments require an acquirer 
to use the guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than using fair value, when recognizing 
and measuring contract assets and contract liabilities related to customer contracts assumed in a business combination."
"We 
early adopted ASU 2021-08 on January 1, 2022."
"The amended guidance applies on a prospective basis to business 
combinations that occur after the adoption date."
"Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2021
ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, removed certain exceptions for 
recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod tax allocations and calculating income taxes in interim 
periods."
"The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax 
goodwill and allocating income taxes to members of a consolidated group."
"We adopted the ASU on the effective date of 
January 1, 2021 and the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements on the 
date of adoption."
"ASU 2020-06 was effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2022, with earlier adoption on January 1, 
2021 permitted."
"The amendments in ASU 2023-07 
improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures."
"This ASU does not change how a 
public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments or applies the quantitative thresholds to 
determine reportable segments."
"This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and early 
adoption is permitted."
"We will adopt the new disclosures retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial 
statements beginning with the annual reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024."
"ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures enhances annual income tax 
disclosures to address investor requests for more information about the tax risks and opportunities present in an entity's 
worldwide operations."
"The two primary enhancements disaggregate existing income tax disclosures related to the effective 
tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid."
"This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 
2024, and early adoption is permitted."
"We will adopt the new disclosures prospectively beginning with the annual 
reporting for the year ended December 31, 2025."
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of QIAGEN N.V."
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
"All 
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated."
"Investments in either common stock or in-
substance common stock of companies where we exercise significant influence over the operations but do not have control, 
and where we are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method."
"All other investments are 
accounted for as discussed under ""Non-Marketable Investments"" below."
"Any subsequent changes in the Company's ownership interest while the Company retains its 
controlling financial interest in its subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions."

expenses during the reporting period."
"While changing conditions in our global environment present additional uncertainty, 
we continue to use the best information available to form our estimates."
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
"Concentrations of Risk
We buy materials for products from many suppliers and are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers for 
the business as a whole."
"However, key components of certain products, including certain instrumentation components and 
chemicals, are available only from a single source."
"If supplies from these vendors were delayed or interrupted for any 
reason, we may not be able to obtain these materials timely or in sufficient quantities in order to produce certain products 
and sales levels could be negatively affected."
"Additionally, our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies, academic institutions, and government and private laboratories."
"Fluctuations in the research and 
development budgets of these researchers and their organizations for applications in which our products are used could 
have a significant effect on the demand for our products."
"The financial instruments used in managing our foreign currency, equity and interest rate exposures have an element of risk 
in that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements."
"We attempt to minimize this risk by limiting 
the counterparties to a diverse group of highly rated international financial institutions."
"The carrying values of our financial 
instruments incorporate the non-performance risk by using market pricing for credit risk."
"However, we have no reason to 
believe that any counterparties will default on their obligations."
"In order to minimize our exposure with any single 
counterparty, we have entered into master agreements which allow us to manage the exposure with the respective 
counterparty on a net basis."
"Other financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents, short-
term investments, and accounts receivable."
"We attempt to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and 
short-term investments by dealing with highly rated financial institutions and investing in a broad and diverse range of 
financial instruments."
"We have established guidelines related to credit quality and maturities of investments intended to 
maintain safety and liquidity."
"Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to a large and 
diverse customer base which is dispersed over different geographic areas."
"Allowances are maintained for potential credit 
losses and such losses have historically been within expected ranges."

Foreign Currency Translation
Our reporting currency is the U.S."
"dollar and the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are generally the local currency 
of the respective countries in which they are headquartered."
"All amounts in the financial statements of entities whose 
functional currency is not the U.S."
"dollar, except for Türkiye (which became hyperinflationary and reports in U.S."
"dollars), 
are translated into U.S."
"dollar equivalents at exchange rates as follows: (1)  assets and liabilities at period-end rates, 
(2) income statement accounts at average exchange rates for the period, and (3) components of equity at historical rates."
"Translation gains or losses are recorded in equity, and transaction gains and losses are reflected in net income as a 
component of other (expense) income, net."
"Realized gains or losses on the value of derivative contracts entered into to 
hedge the exchange rate exposure of receivables and payables are also included in net income as a component of other 
(expense) income, net."
"The net gain or loss on foreign currency transactions was a net loss of $5.8 million in 2023, a net 
gain of $2.7 million in 2022, and a net loss of $9.0 million in 2021 and is included in other (expense) income, net."
"Our chief operating decision maker 
(CODM) makes decisions based on the Company as a whole."
"In addition, we have a common basis of organization and 
types of products and services which derive revenues and consistent product margins."
"Accordingly, we operate and make 
decisions as one reporting unit."
"Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services transfers to our customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services."
"The majority of our sales revenue is 
recognized when products are shipped to the customers, at which point control transfers."

Warranty
We provide warranties on our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year."
"A 
provision for estimated future warranty costs is recorded in cost of sales at the time product revenue is recognized."
"Product 
warranty obligations are included in accrued and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets."
"Research and Development
Research and product development costs are expensed as incurred."
"Research and development expenses consist primarily 
of salaries and related expenses, facility costs, and amounts paid to contract research organizations and laboratories for 
the provision of services and materials as well as costs for internal use or clinical trials."
"Government Grants
We recognize government grants when there is reasonable assurance that all conditions will be complied with and the 
grant will be received."
"Our government grants generally represent subsidies for specified activities and are therefore 
recognized when earned as a reduction of the expenses recorded for the activity that the grants are intended to 
compensate."
"Thus, when the grant relates to research and development expense, the grant is recognized over the same 
period that the related costs are incurred."
"Otherwise, amounts received under government grants are recorded as liabilities 
in the balance sheet."
"When the grant relates to an asset, the nominal amount of the grant is deducted from the carrying 
amount of the asset and recognized over the same period that the related asset is depreciated."
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
"Shipping and Handling Income and Costs
Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are recorded as revenue in the period that the related product sales 
revenue is recorded."
Associated costs of shipping and handling are included in sales and marketing expenses.
"For the 
years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, shipping and handling costs totaled $32.4 million, $34.4 million and 
$31.7 million, respectively."
"Advertising Costs
The costs of advertising are expensed as incurred and are included as a component of sales and marketing expense."
"Advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $11.5 million, $15.8 million and $13.5 
million, respectively."

General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily represent the costs required to support administrative infrastructure."
"These 
costs include licensing costs in connection with continued investments in information technology improvements, including 
cyber security, across the organization as well as personnel in administrative functions."
"Restructuring, Acquisition, Integration and Other
We incur indirect acquisition and business integration costs in connection with business combinations which are expensed 
when incurred."
"These costs represent incremental costs that we believe would not have been incurred absent the business 
combinations."
"Restructuring costs include personnel costs (principally termination benefits) as well as contract and other costs, primarily 
contract termination costs."
"Termination benefits are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 712, Compensation 
- Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits, and are recorded when it is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits 
and the amounts can be reasonably estimated."
"Estimates of termination benefits are based on the frequency of past 
termination benefits, the similarity of benefits under the current plan and prior plans, and the existence of statutory required 
minimum benefits."
"Contract and other costs are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal 
Cost Obligations and are recorded when the liability is incurred."
"Additionally, expenses incurred may also include costs 
that are an integral component of, and are directly attributable to, restructuring activities which do not qualify as exit and 
disposal costs, such as intangible asset impairments and other asset related write-offs."
"The specific restructuring measures 
and associated estimated costs are based on management's best business judgment under the existing circumstances at the 
time the estimates are made."
"If future events require changes to these estimates, such adjustments will be reflected in the 
period of the revised estimate."
"Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the liability method."
"Deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined 
by multiplying the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and liabilities by 
the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are reversed or settled."
"Deferred tax assets are 
reduced by a valuation allowance to the amount more likely than not to be realized."
"The effect on deferred taxes of a 
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date."
"Our policy is to recognize interest accrued related to income taxes in 
interest expense and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense."
"Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative financial instrument contracts to minimize the variability of cash flows or income statement impact 
associated with the anticipated transactions being hedged or to hedge fluctuating interest rates."
"As changes in foreign 
currencies or interest rates impact the value of anticipated transactions, the fair value of the forward or swap contracts also 
changes, offsetting foreign currency or interest rate fluctuations."
"Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at 
fair value."
"Changes in fair values of derivatives are recorded in current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), 
depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction."
"Share-Based Payments
Compensation costs for all share-based payments are recorded based on the grant date fair value, less an estimate for pre-
vesting forfeitures, recognized in expense over the service period using an accelerated method."
"Forfeiture Rate - This is the estimated percentage of grants that are expected to be forfeited or canceled on an annual basis 
before becoming fully vested."
We estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeiture experience.
"Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units - Restricted stock units and performance stock units represent rights to 
receive Common Shares at a future date."
"The fair market value of restricted and performance stock units is determined 
based on the number of stock units granted and the fair market value of our shares on the grant date."
"The fair market value 
at the time of the grant, less an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, is recognized in expense over the vesting period."
"At 
each reporting period, the estimated performance achievement of the performance stock units is assessed and any change 
in the estimated achievement is recorded on a cumulative basis in the period of adjustment."
"Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit in banks and other cash invested temporarily in various instruments 
that are short-term and highly liquid with an original maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase."

"Interest income is accrued when earned and changes in fair market values are reflected in other (expense) 
income, net."
"The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity arising from acquisition are included in 
interest income."
"A decline in fair value that is judged to be other-than-temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the 
write-down is included in the consolidated statements of income."
"Realized gains and losses, determined on a specific 
identification basis on the sale of short-term investments, are included in other (expense) income, net."
"Short-term investments consisting of marketable equity securities are reported at fair value with gains and losses recorded in 
earnings."
"Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, notes receivable, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued 
liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short maturities of those instruments."
"The carrying value of our 
variable rate debt and leases approximates their fair values because of the short maturities and/or interest rates which are 
comparable to those available to us on similar terms."
"The fair values of the zero coupon convertible debt and the Cash 
Convertible Notes are based on an estimation using available over-the-counter market information."
"The fair values of the 
German Private Placement are based on an estimation using changes in the euro swap rates."
"Accounts Receivable, Loans and Other Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
Our accounts receivable consist of unsecured customer obligations and we are at risk to the extent such amounts become 
uncollectible."
"We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to 
make required payments."
"We recognize the allowance for expected credit losses at inception and reassess regularly 
considering historical experience with bad debts, the aging of the receivables, credit quality of the customer base, current

"Once a 
receivable is determined to be uncollectible, the balance is charged against the allowance."
We sell our products worldwide through sales subsidiaries and distributors.
"There is no concentration of credit risk with 
respect to trade accounts receivable as we have a large number of internationally dispersed customers."
"Trade accounts 
receivable are non-interest bearing and mostly have payment terms of 30-90 days."
"For all years presented, no single 
customer represented more than ten percent of accounts receivable or consolidated net sales."
"Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined on either a weighted average cost basis or a 
standard cost basis which is regularly adjusted to actual."
"Inventories include material, direct labor and overhead costs and

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated amortization."
"Costs associated with preliminary development, such as the evaluation and selection 
of alternatives, as well as training, maintenance and support are expensed as incurred."
"Costs for software to be sold, 
leased or otherwise marketed that are related to the conceptual formulation and design are expensed as incurred."
"Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the assets."
"Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight-line basis over 
the lesser of the remaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement asset."
"We have a policy of 
capitalizing expenditures that materially increase assets’ useful lives and charging ordinary maintenance and repairs to 
operations as incurred."
"When property or equipment is disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and 
amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in earnings."
"Leases
At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease."
"A contract is, or contains, a 
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration."
"Company as a lessee
Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available 
for use or at the lease commencement date."
"Leases are classified as finance or operating based on the criteria according 
to ASC 842 Leases, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition and amortization of the right-of-use 
asset in the income statement."
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.

• payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option."
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
"After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced by the lease payments made."
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges.
"The interest element of the finance cost is 
recognized in the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability for each period."
"In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there 
is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the 
assessment to purchase the underlying asset."
"Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:
• the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;
• any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;
• any initial direct costs; and
• restoration costs."
"The company applies judgment in evaluating whether it is reasonably 
certain to exercise the option to renew."
"That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to 
exercise the renewal."
"The company leases various items of real estate, vehicles and other equipment."
"Rental contracts are typically made for 
fixed periods but may have extension or termination options."
"Company as a lessor
When the company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating 
lease."
"Leases in which the company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an 
asset are classified as operating leases."
"The company recognizes lease payments received under operating leases as 
income on a straight-line basis over the lease terms in the Income Statement."

Business Combinations
We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date."
"The purchase price of an 
acquired business is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the 
date of acquisition."
"Those fair values are determined using income, cost and market approaches, most of which depend 
upon significant inputs that are not observable in the market, or Level 3 measurements."
"The excess of purchase price over 
the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill."
"Acquisition-related expenses 
are expensed as incurred."
"The purchase price for some business combinations includes consideration that is contingent on the achievement of net 
sales or earnings targets by the acquired business."
"Contingent consideration is measured initially and on a recurring basis 
at fair value."
"Payments to settle the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration are presented as financing 
activities on the statement of cash flows; any payments in excess of the acquisition date fair value are presented as 
operating activities."
"Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill
Acquired intangibles with future uses are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and consist of licenses to 
technology held by third parties and other acquired intangible assets."
"Amortization related to patents are computed over 
the estimated useful life of the underlying patent, which has historically ranged from 1 to 20 years."
"Purchased intangible 
assets acquired in business combinations, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless these 
lives are determined to be indefinite."
"Intangibles are assessed for recoverability considering the contract life and the period 
of time over which the intangible will contribute to future cash flow."
"The unamortized cost of intangible assets, where cash 
flows are independent and identifiable from other assets, is evaluated periodically and adjusted, if necessary, if events and 
circumstances indicate that a decline in value below the carrying amount has occurred."
"Amortization expense related to developed technology and patent and license rights which have been acquired in a 
business combination is included in cost of sales."
"Amortization of trademarks, customer base and non-compete agreements 
which have been acquired in a business combination is recorded in operating expense under acquisition-related intangible 
amortization."
"Amortization expenses of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination are recorded within either 
the cost of sales, research and development or sales and marketing line items based on the use of the asset."
"We dispose the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of fully amortized intangible assets from historic 
business combinations once they are considered fully integrated into our business."
"The fair value of in-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an 
indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the related research and development activities."
"IPR&D 
is tested for impairment annually or when any event or circumstance indicates that the fair value may be below the carrying 
value."
"If and when research and development is complete, the associated asset is amortized over the estimated useful life."
"Goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or earlier if indicators of potential 
impairment exist."
We have elected to perform our annual test for indications of impairment as of October 1st of each year.
"Following the annual impairment tests for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, goodwill has not been 
impaired."
"Non-Marketable Investments
We have investments in non-marketable equity securities issued by privately held companies."
"These investments are 
included in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets."
"Non-marketable investments through 
which we exercise significant influence but do not have control are accounted for using the equity method, which requires 
that we recorded our share of unrealized gains and losses on our equity method investments in other (expense) income, 
net."
We monitor for changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of the level of influence.
"Our non-
marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are accounted for under the measurement 
alternative."
"Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus 
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same 
issuer."
Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date.
"Investments are evaluated periodically, or when impairment indicators are noted, to determine if declines in value are 
other-than-temporary."
"In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a 
security."
"We consider whether the fair values of any of our non-marketable investments have declined below their carrying value 
whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable."
We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary.
"Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our 
determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary."
"If we are not the 
primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE as an investment in a non-
marketable investment or in accordance with other applicable GAAP."
"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable."
"We consider, amongst other indicators, a history of 
operating losses or a change in expected sales levels to be indicators of potential impairment."
"Assets are grouped and 
evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the 
cash flows of other groups of assets."
"If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured as the amount by which 
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value as determined by applicable market prices, when available."
"When 
market prices are not available, we generally measure fair value by discounting projected future cash flows of the asset."
Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows.
"Accordingly, actual results could differ from 
such estimates."

"Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or 
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or 
services."
"From time to time, we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which 
are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations."
"The transaction price is allocated to 
performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices."
We offer warranties on our products.
"Certain of our warranties are assurance-type in nature and do not cover anything 
beyond ensuring that the product is functioning as intended."
"Based on the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 606, assurance-
type warranties do not represent separate performance obligations."
"The Company also sells separately-priced service 
contracts which qualify as service-type warranties and represent separate performance obligations."
"We sell our products and services both directly to customers and through distributors generally under agreements with 
payment terms typically less than 90 days and, in most cases, not exceeding one year and therefore contracts do not 
contain a significant financing component."
"Consumable and Related Revenue 
Consumable Products: In the last three years, revenue from consumable product sales has accounted for between 
78-81% of our net sales and revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a 
customer are satisfied."
"The majority of our contracts have either a single performance obligation to transfer a single 
consumable product or multiple performance obligations to transfer multiple products concurrently."
"Accordingly, we 
recognize revenue when control of the products has transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment 
of products as this is when title and risk of loss have been transferred."
"In addition, invoicing typically occurs at this time so 
this is when we have a present right to payment."
"Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive 
in exchange for transferring products and is generally based upon a negotiated formula, list or fixed price."
"Licenses: Licenses for on-site software, which allow customers to use the software as it exists when made available, are 
sold as perpetual licenses or term licenses."
"Revenue from on-site licenses is recognized at the later of when the software 
is made available to the customer or the beginning of the license term."
"When a portion of the transaction price is 
allocated to a performance obligation to provide support and/or updates, revenue is recognized as the updates/
support are provided, generally over the life of the license."
"Fees from research collaborations include payments for 
technology transfer and access rights."
"If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is 
included in the transaction price."
"Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as milestones which are 
achieved through regulatory approvals, are considered to be constrained and excluded from the transaction price until 
the required approvals are received."
"Revenue is recognized following the input method as this is considered to best 
depict the timing of the transfer of control."
"This involves measuring actual hours incurred to date as a proportion of the 
total budgeted hours of the project."
"At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the proportion of completion is 
trued-up."
"We also re-evaluate the probability of achievement of development milestones and any related constraint on 
a periodic basis and, if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price."
"Any such adjustments are 
recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment."
"Instruments
Revenue from instrumentation includes the instrumentation equipment, installation, training and other instrumentation 
services, such as extended warranty services or product maintenance contracts, and over the last three years has 
accounted for 12% of net sales."
"Revenue from instrumentation equipment is recognized when the customer obtains control 
of the instrument which is predominantly at the time of delivery or upon customer acceptance, where applicable."

revenue is recognized over the term of the service period as the customers benefit from the service throughout the service 
period."
Revenue related to services performed on a time-and-materials basis is recognized when performed.
"Contract Estimates
The majority of our revenue is derived from contracts (i) with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) 
contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount in which we have the right to invoice as product is delivered."
"We 
have elected the practical expedient not to disclose the value of remaining performance obligations associated with these 
types of contracts."
"However, we have certain companion diagnostic co-development contracts to provide research and development activities 
in which our performance obligations extend over multiple years."
"As of December  31, 2023, remaining performance 
obligations totaled $55.5 million for which the transaction price is not constrained related to these contracts which we 
expect to recognize over the next 12 to 18 months."
"Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled 
receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) in the consolidated balance sheet."
"Contract assets as of December  31, 2023 and 2022 totaled $15.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively, and are 
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and relate to the 
companion diagnostic co-development contracts discussed above."
"Contract liabilities primarily relate to non-cancellable advances or deposits received from customers before revenue is 
recognized and are primarily related to instrument service and software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangements."
"During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we 
satisfied the associated performance obligations and recognized revenue of $66.8 million and $57.6 million, respectively, 
related to advance customer payments previously received."

"Acquisitions
We undertake acquisitions to complement our own internal product development activities."
"Our acquisitions have 
historically been made at prices above the fair value of the acquired net assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations 
of synergies of combining the businesses."
"2023 Business Combination
On January 3, 2023, we acquired 100% of the shares of Verogen, Inc., a leader in the use of next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) technologies to drive the future of human identification (HID) and forensic investigation."
"Verogen, a privately held 
company founded in 2017 and based in San Diego, California, supports the global human identification community with 
NGS tools and professional services to help resolve criminal and missing-persons cases."
"The cash consideration, net of 
cash acquired was $149.5 million."
"The acquisition is not significant to the overall consolidated financial statements and as 
of September 30, 2023, the allocation of the purchase price was final."
"At the acquisition date, all the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values and our consolidated results of operations include the 
operating results from the acquired company from the acquisition date."
"The acquisition did not have a material impact to 
net sales, net income or earnings per common share and therefore no pro forma information has been provided herein."
"2022 Business Combination
On May 11, 2022, we acquired BLIRT S.A., a supplier of standardized and customized solutions for proteins and enzymes 
as well as molecular biology reagents located in Gdańsk, Poland."
"Its offering includes proteins and enzymes that are 
critical to the life sciences industry and diagnostic kit manufacturers."
"The cash consideration, net of cash acquired was 
$63.7 million."
The acquisition was not significant to the overall consolidated financial statements.
"At the acquisition date, 
all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values and our consolidated results of 
operations include the operating results from the acquired company from the acquisition date."
"The acquisition did not have

Non-Marketable Investments 
We have made strategic investments in certain privately-held companies without readily determinable market values."
"TVM Life Science Ventures III (TVM) is a limited partnership and we account for our 3.1% investment under the equity 
method as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the limited partnership."
"This investment is valued at net 
asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary."
"During the years ended December  31, 2023, 
2022 and 2021, we made $2.4 million, $1.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, in additional cash payments to TVM 
and, as of December 31, 2023, have $6.8 million of unfunded commitments through 2029 related to this investment."
"We 
do not have the right to redeem these funds under the normal course of operations of this partnership."
"During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we received dividends of $9.1 million, $7.5 million and 
$4.7 million, respectively, from PreAnalytix GmbH."
"These dividends are included in other items, net including fair value 
QIAGEN N.V."
"As of December 31, 2023, four of our equity method investments are variable interest entities and we are not the primary 
beneficiary as we do not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance."
"Therefore, these investments are not consolidated."
"As of 
December 31, 2022, these investments held a balance of $8.4 million, of which $8.7 million is included in other long-term 
assets and $0.3 million is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet."
"These investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting 
from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer."

resulting from impairment and observable price changes are recognized in the statements of income during the period the 
change is identified."

"During 2022, we recorded a charge to 
restructuring, acquisition, integration and other, net in the accompanying statement of income to fully impair a license with 
a carrying value of $12.8 million."
"This license was to use technology of Ellume Limited, Australia."
"In connection with Ellume 
starting insolvency proceedings in September 2022, we decided to cease all product development and manufacturing 
activities associated with this license and determined that there was no alternative use nor recoverable value."
"Accordingly, 
the license was fully impaired."
"in January 2023 and foreign currency translation adjustments driven by changes in the euro,

"Leases
We have operating leases primarily for real estate."
"The leases generally have terms which range from one year to 15 
years, some include options to extend or renew, and some include options to early terminate the leases."
"As of 
December  31, 2023 and 2022, no such options have been recognized as part of the right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities."
Operating leases can contain variable lease charges based on an index like consumer prices or rates.
"During the years 
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, amounts recorded as variable lease payments not included in the operating lease

"Derivatives and Hedging
Objective and Strategy
In the ordinary course of business, we use derivative instruments, including swaps, forwards and/or options, to manage 
potential losses from foreign currency exposures and interest-bearing assets or liabilities."
"The principal objective of such 
derivative instruments is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with our global financial and operating activities."
We do not utilize derivative or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
"As of December  31, 2023, cash collateral positions consisted of $5.4 million recorded in accrued and other current

balance sheet."
"As of December  31, 2022, we had cash collateral positions consisting of $21.8 million recorded in 
accrued and other current liabilities and $21.1 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheet."
"Non-Derivative Hedging Instrument
Net Investment Hedge
We are party to a foreign currency non-derivative hedging instrument that is designated and qualifies as a net investment 
hedge."
"The objective of the hedge is to protect part of the net investment in foreign operations against adverse changes in 
the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S."
"Of the $331.1 million, which is held in both U.S."
"dollars and euros, €255.0 million was designated as the 
hedging instrument as of December 31, 2022 against a portion of our euro net investments in our foreign operations."
"As 
further described in Note 16, four tranches of the 2017 Schuldschein matured and were paid in October 2022 and two 
tranches of the 2017 Schuldschein matured and were paid during 2021."
"As a result, €109.5 million remained designated 
as a hedging instrument as of December 31, 2023."
"In July 2022, we issued an additional €370.0 million German private 
corporate bond (2022 Schuldschein) as described in Note 16, and it is designated in its entirety as the hedging instrument 
against a portion of our euro net investments in our foreign operations."
"The relative changes in both the hedged item and 
hedging instrument are calculated by applying the change in spot rate between two assessment dates against the 
respective notional amount."
"The effective portion of the hedge is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account 
within accumulated other comprehensive loss."
"Based on the spot rate method, the unrealized loss recorded in equity as of 
December  31, 2023 and 2022 is $35.2 million and $22.6 million, respectively."
"Since we are using the debt as the 
hedging instrument, which is also remeasured based on the spot rate method, there is no hedge ineffectiveness related to 
the net investment hedge as of December 31, 2023 and 2022."
"Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
Net Investment Hedge 
In September 2022, we entered into a one-month interest rate derivative contract for a total notional amount 
€135.0 million, that matured on October 13, 2022, which qualified as a net investment hedge."
"The objective of the hedge 
was to protect the additional investments in foreign operations in September 2022 against adverse changes in the 
exchange rate between the euro and the functional currency of the U.S."
"The relative changes in both the hedged 
item and derivative hedging instrument were calculated by applying the change in spot rate between two assessment dates 
against the respective notional amount."
"The effective portion of the hedge is recorded in the cumulative translation 
adjustment account within accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to earnings upon the disposal or

liquidation of the foreign operations."
"In October 2022, the interest rate derivative contract expired and the unrealized gain 
recorded in equity was $5.8 million as of December 31, 2022."
"Gains 
and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment 
of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings."
"To date, we have not recorded any hedge ineffectiveness related to 
any cash flow hedges in earnings."
"Based on their valuation as of December 31, 2023, we expect approximately $2.1 
million of derivative gains included in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into income during the 
next 12 months."
"The cash flows derived from derivatives are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the 
same category as the hedged item."
"We use interest rate derivative contracts to align our portfolio of interest-bearing assets and liabilities with our risk 
management objectives."
"Since 2015, we have been a party to five cross-currency interest rate swaps through 2025 for a 
total notional amount of €180.0 million which qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges."
"In September 2022, we 
entered into five new cross-currency interest rate swaps through 2025 for a total notional amount of CHF 542.0 million 
which qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges."
"We determined that no ineffectiveness exists related to these 
swaps."
"As of December  31, 2023 and 2022, interest receivables of $8.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively, are 
recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets."
"Fair Value Hedges
Until October 2022, we held derivative instruments that qualified for hedge accounting as fair value hedges."
"For derivative 
instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative 
is reflected in earnings."
"This effect on earnings is offset by the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to 
the risk being hedged that is also recorded in earnings."
"The cash flows derived from derivatives are classified in the 
consolidated statement of cash flows in the same category as the consolidated balance sheet account of the underlying 
item."
"We held interest rate swaps which effectively fixed the fair value of a portion of our fixed rate private placement debt and 
qualified for hedge accounting as fair value hedges."
"There had been no 
ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swaps."
"In these 
transactions, the Call Options are intended to address the equity price risk inherent in the cash conversion feature of each 
instrument by offsetting cash payments in excess of the principal amount due upon any conversion of the Cash Convertible 
Notes."
"Accordingly, the derivative is presented as either current or long-term based upon the classification of the related 
debt."
"Aside from the initial payment of premiums for the Call Options, we will not be required to make any cash payments under 
the Call Options."
"We will, however, be entitled to receive under the terms of the Call Options, an amount of cash generally 
equal to the amount by which the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the Call 
Options during the relevant valuation period."
"The exercise price under the Call Options is equal to the conversion price of 
the Cash Convertible Notes."
"The Call Options, for which our common stock is the underlying security, are derivative assets that require mark-to-market 
accounting treatment."
"The Call Options are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 2 of the 
fair value hierarchy."
"The change in fair value is recognized immediately in our consolidated statements of income in other 
(expense) income, net."
"The embedded cash conversion option is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis within 
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy."
"Because the terms of the Cash Convertible Notes' embedded cash conversion option are substantially similar to those of the 
Call Options, discussed above, we expect the effect on earnings from these two derivative instruments to mostly offset each 
other."
"In September 2023, the 2023 Notes and the related Call Options have been settled as described in Note 16 and 
we recognized a gain of $0.9  million in other (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of 
income."
"This includes foreign currency-denominated receivables, payables, debt and other balance sheet positions 
including intercompany items."
"We manage balance sheet exposure on a group-wide basis using foreign exchange forward 
contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps."
"We are party to various foreign exchange forward, option and swap arrangements which had an aggregate notional 
value of $590.9 million at December 31, 2023, which expire at various dates through September 2024."
"At December 31, 
2022, these arrangements had an aggregate notional value of $466.0 million, which expired at various dates through July 
2023."
"The transactions have been entered into to offset the effects from short-term balance sheet exposure to foreign 
currency exchange risk."
"Changes in the fair value of these arrangements have been recognized in other (expense) income, 
net."

"Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities are measured at fair value according to a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs 
used in measuring fair value as follows:
• Level 1."
"Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets;
• Level 2."
"Inputs, other than the quoted price in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
• Level 3."
"Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its 
own assumptions."
"There were no transfers between levels 
for the year ended December 31, 2023."
"In determining fair value for Level 2 instruments, we apply a market approach using quoted active market prices relevant to 
the particular instrument under valuation, giving consideration to the credit risk of both the respective counterparty to the 
contract and the Company."
"To determine our credit risk, we estimated our credit rating by benchmarking the price of 
outstanding debt to publicly-available comparable data from rated companies."
"Using the estimated rating, our credit risk 
was quantified by reference to publicly-traded debt with a corresponding rating."
"The Level 2 derivative financial 
instruments include the Call Options asset and the embedded conversion option liability."
"See Note 16 ""Debt"" and Note 14 
""Derivatives and Hedging"" for further information."
"The derivatives are not actively traded and are valued based on an 
option pricing model that uses observable market data for inputs."
"Significant market data inputs used to determine fair 
values included our common stock price, the risk-free interest rate, and the implied volatility of our common stock."
"The Call 
Options asset and the embedded cash conversion option liability were designed with the intent that changes in their fair 
values would substantially offset, with limited net impact to our earnings."
"Therefore, the sensitivity of changes in the 
unobservable inputs to the option pricing model for such instruments is substantially mitigated."
Our Level 3 instruments include non-marketable equity security investments.
"Under the measurement alternative, the 
carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in 
orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer."
"Adjustments are determined primarily based on 
a market approach as of the transaction date."
"Refer to Note 10 ""Investments"" for the change in non-marketable equity 
securities with Level 3 inputs during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022."
Our Level 3 instruments also include contingent consideration liabilities.
"We value contingent consideration liabilities using 
unobservable inputs, applying the income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique or the probability-
weighted scenario method."
"Contingent consideration arrangements obligate us to pay the sellers of an acquired entity if 
specified future events occur or conditions are met, such as the achievement of technological or revenue milestones."
"We 
use various key assumptions, such as the probability of achievement of the milestones (0% to 100%) and the discount rate 
(between 6.5% and 6.6%), to represent the non-performing risk factors and time value when applying the income

approach."
"We regularly review the fair value of the contingent consideration and reflect any change in the accrual in the 
consolidated statements of income in the line items commensurate with the underlying nature of milestone arrangements."
"As of December 31, 2022, $18.1 million was accrued 
for contingent consideration, of which $8.2 million was included in accrued and other current liabilities and $9.9 million 
was included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet."
"The estimated fair value of long-term debt, as disclosed in Note 16 ""Debt,"" was based on current interest rates for similar 
types of borrowings."
"The estimated fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could be 
realized as of the balance sheet date or that will be realized in the future."
German Private Placements: Fair value is based on an estimation using changes in the euro swap rates.
"There were no adjustments in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 for nonfinancial assets or liabilities required 
to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis."

The 2027 Notes carry no coupon interest.
"The net proceeds of 
the 2027 Notes totaled $497.6 million, after payment of debt issuance costs of $3.7 million."
"In accounting for the issuance of the 2027 Notes in 2020 prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, we separated the 2027 
Notes into liability and equity components."
"ASU 2020-06 was adopted on January 1, 2021, and this 
QIAGEN N.V."
"The effective interest rate of the 2027 Notes is 1.65%, which is imputed based on the amortization of the fair value of the 
embedded conversion option over the remaining term of the 2027 Notes."
"The 2027 Notes are convertible into common shares based on an initial conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of 
2,477.65 shares per $200,000 principal amount of notes (which represented an initial conversion price of $80.7218 per 
share or 6.2  million underlying shares)."
"Following the January 2024 synthetic share repurchase discussed in Note 18 
""Equity,"" the adjusted conversion rate became 2,475.26 shares per $200,000 principal amount of notes, which 
represents an adjusted conversion price per share of $80.7996."
"At conversion, we will settle the 2027 Notes by repaying 
the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common 
shares."
"The notes may be redeemed at the option of each noteholder at their principal amount on December 17, 2025 or in 
connection with a change of control or delisting event (as further described in the 2027 Notes)."
"The noteholders may convert their notes at any time, without condition, on or after June 17, 2027 until the 45th business 
day prior to December 17, 2027."
"No Contingent Conversion Conditions were triggered for the 2027 Notes as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 
2022."
"Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and 2024
On September 13, 2017, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Cash Convertible Senior Notes which 
were due and repaid in September 2023 (2023 Notes)."
"The net proceeds of the 2023 Notes were $365.6 million, after 
payment of the net cost of the Call Spread Overlay described below and transaction costs."
"On November 13, 2018, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Cash Convertible Senior Notes which 
is due in 2024 (2024 Notes)."
"The net proceeds of the 2024 Notes were $468.9 million, after payment of the net cost of 
the Call Spread Overlay described below and transaction costs."
"Interest on the Cash Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on the maturity date unless 
repurchased or converted with their terms prior to such date."
"The interest rate and corresponding maturity of each Note are 
summarized in the table below."
"The Cash Convertible Notes that remain outstanding as of December 31, 2023 are solely 
convertible into cash in whole, but not in part, at the option of noteholders under the circumstances described below and 
during the contingent conversion periods as shown in the table below."
"Additionally, conversion may occur at any time following a Contingent Conversion Period through the fifth business day 
immediately preceding the applicable maturity date."
"Upon conversion, noteholders will receive an amount in cash equal to the Cash Settlement Amount, calculated as described 
below."
The Cash Convertible Notes are not convertible into shares of our common stock or any other securities.
"For the 2023 Notes, the Contingent Conversion Period expired on March 13, 2023 and, as of March 31, 2023, the 
Contingent Conversion Conditions for the 2023 Notes could no longer be triggered."
"No Contingent Conversion Conditions 
were triggered for the 2023 Notes as of December 31, 2022."
"No Contingent Conversion Conditions were triggered for the 2024 Notes as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 
2022."
"As a result, pursuant to 
the accounting provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, these features noted above are not required to be 
bifurcated as separate instruments."
"Upon conversion, holders are entitled to a cash payment (Cash Settlement Amount) equal to the average of the conversion 
rate multiplied by the daily volume-weighted average trading price for our common shares over a 50-day period."
"The 
conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain instances but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest."
"In 
addition, following the occurrence of certain corporate events that may occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we may

"The initial fair value 
liability of the embedded cash conversion option was $74.5 million for the 2023 Notes and $98.5 million for the 2024 
Notes, which simultaneously reduced the carrying value of the Cash Convertible Notes (effectively serving as an original 
issuance discount)."
"This resulted in our recognition of interest 
expense on the Cash Convertible Notes at an effective rate approximating what we would have incurred had 
nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms been issued."
"The effective interest rate is 3.997% for 2023 Notes and 
4.782% for the 2024 Notes, which is imputed based on the amortization of the fair value of the embedded cash 
conversion option over the remaining term of the Cash Convertible Notes."
"We incurred approximately $6.2 million and $5.7 million in transaction costs for the 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes, 
respectively."
"Such costs have been allocated to the Cash Convertible Notes and deferred and are being amortized to 
interest expense over the terms of the Cash Convertible Notes using the effective interest method."
"Cash Convertible Notes Call Spread Overlay 
Concurrent with the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions (Call 
Options) with, and issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock (Warrants) to, certain financial institutions."
"We 
refer to the Call Options and Warrants collectively as the “Call Spread Overlay.” The Call Options are intended to offset 
any cash payments payable by us in excess of the principal amount due upon any conversion of the Cash Convertible 
Notes."
"The exercise price 
under the Call Options is initially equal to the conversion price of the Cash Convertible Notes."
"During the third quarter of 2023, we received $36.8 million in cash upon the exercise of Call Options in connection with 
the repayment of 2023 Notes."
"In the same transaction, we paid $36.8 million for the intrinsic value of the 2023 Notes' 
embedded conversion option."
"The Warrants that were issued with our Cash Convertible Notes, could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the price of 
our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the Warrants."
"For each Warrant that is exercised, we will deliver 
to the holder a number of shares of our common stock equal to the amount by which the settlement price exceeds the 
exercise price, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares."
We will not receive any proceeds if the Warrants are exercised.
"Private Placement
On October 16, 2012, we completed a private placement through the issuance of new senior unsecured notes at a total 
amount of $400.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.66% (settled on October 16, 2012)."
"The notes were 
issued in three series: (1) $73.0 million 7-year term due and paid on October 16, 2019 (3.19%); (2) $300.0 million 10-
year term due and paid on October 16, 2022 (3.75%); and (3) $27.0 million 12-year term due on October 16, 2024 
(3.90%) but called and paid in October 2022."
"We paid $2.1 million in debt issuance costs which were amortized 
through interest expense using the effective interest method over the lifetime of the notes."
"The note purchase agreement 
contained certain financial and non-financial covenants, including but not limited to, restrictions on priority indebtedness 
and the maintenance of certain financial ratios."
"We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2022."
"During 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps, which effectively fixed the fair value of $200.0 million of this debt."
"The 
interest rate swaps expired in October 2022 following the repayments of $127.0 million in 2022 and $73.0 million in 
2019."
"German Private Placement (2017 Schuldschein)
In 2017, we completed a German private placement bond (2017 Schuldschein) which was issued in several tranches 
totaling $331.1 million due in various periods through 2027."
"In the first quarter of 2021, we repaid $41.1 million for two

earnings retained by our subsidiaries that would be subject to tax if distributed amounted to $1.2 billion at December 31, 
2023."
"Estimating the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings is not 
practicable."
"Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, we may be subject to taxes including withholding tax."
"We have 
$14.5 million of undistributed earnings that we do not consider indefinitely reinvested and have recorded a deferred tax 
liability at December 31, 2023 and 2022 of $0.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively."

"Equity
Shares
The authorized classes of our shares consist of Common Shares (410 million authorized), Preference Shares (450 million 
authorized) and Financing Preference Shares (40 million authorized)."
All classes of shares have a par value of €0.01.
"No 
Financing Preference Shares or Preference Shares have been issued."
Common Shares are translated to U.S.
"dollars at the 
foreign exchange rates in effect when the shares are issued."
"Synthetic Share Repurchase
In January 2024, we completed a synthetic share repurchase that combined a direct capital repayment with a reverse 
stock split."
"The transaction was announced on January 7, 2024 and involved an approach used by various large, 
multinational Dutch companies to provide returns to all shareholders in a faster and more efficient manner than traditional 
open-market repurchases."
"$295.2 million was returned to shareholders through the transaction, which reduced the total 
number of issued Common Shares by approximately 3% to 223.9 million (of which 2.5 million Common Shares are held in 
Treasury Shares) as of January 31, 2024."
"Issuance and Conversion of Warrants
In connection with the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes as described in Note 16 ""Debt,"" we issued Warrants as 
summarized in the table below."
"The number of warrants and exercise prices are subject to customary adjustments under 
certain circumstances."
"The proceeds, net of issuance costs, from the sale of the Warrants are included as additional paid-in 
capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets."
The Warrants are exercisable only upon expiration.
"For each Warrant that is exercised, we will deliver to the holder a 
number of shares of our common stock equal to the amount by which the settlement price exceeds the exercise price, 
divided by the settlement price, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares."
"The Warrants could separately have a dilutive 
effect on shares of our common stock to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the 
applicable exercise price of the Warrants (as measured under the terms of the Warrants)."
"Following the January 
2024 synthetic share repurchase discussed above, the adjusted weighted average exercise price per share for the 2024 
Notes is $50.3346."
"Share Repurchase Programs
On July 12, 2021, we announced our seventh share repurchase program of up to $100 million of our common shares."
"During 2021, we repurchased 1.9 million QIAGEN shares for $100.0 million (including transaction costs)."
"This program 
ended on October 29, 2021."
"The cost of repurchased shares is included in treasury stock and reported as a reduction in total equity when a repurchase 
occurs."
"Repurchased shares will be held in treasury in order to satisfy various obligations, which include exchangeable 
debt instruments, warrants and employee share-based remuneration plans."

"Earnings Per Common Share 
We present basic and diluted earnings per common share."
"Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing the 
net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding."
"Diluted earnings per common share reflect the 
potential dilution of earnings that would occur if all “in the money” securities to issue common shares were exercised."
"Since the 2027 Notes were out of the money and anti-dilutive during the period from January 1, 
2021 through December 31, 2023, they were excluded from the diluted earnings per common share calculation in 2021, 
2022 and 2023."

"Commitments and Contingencies
Licensing and Purchase Commitments
We have licensing agreements with companies, universities and individuals, some of which require certain up-front 
payments."
"Royalty payments are required on net product sales ranging from 0.45 percent to 25 percent of covered 
products or based on quantities sold."
Several of these agreements have minimum royalty requirements.
"The accompanying 
consolidated balance sheets include accrued royalties relating to these agreements in the amount of $9.7 million and 
$12.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"Royalty expense relating to these agreements amounted to 
$13.9 million, $15.5 million, and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively."
"Royalty expense is primarily recorded in cost of sales, with a small portion recorded as research and development expense 
depending on the use of the technology under license."
"Some of these agreements also have minimum raw material 
purchase requirements and requirements to perform specific types of research."
"At December  31, 2023, we had commitments to purchase goods or services and to make future license and royalty 
payments."
"Potential 
milestone payments total $20.7 million and may be triggered by the end of 2024."

In the ordinary course of business, we provide a warranty to customers that our products are free of defects and will 
conform to published specifications."
"Generally, the applicable product warranty period is one year from the date of 
delivery of the product to the customer or of site acceptance, if required."
"Additionally, we typically provide limited 
warranties with respect to our services."
We provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of the product sale.
"As of December 31, 2023, certain 
claims, suits or legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business have been filed or were pending against 
QIAGEN N.V."
"These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of business as well as through 
acquisition."
"Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing litigation 
contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events."
"Although it is not possible to predict the 
outcome of such litigation, we assess the degree of probability and evaluate the reasonably possible losses that we could 
incur as a result of these matters."
"We accrue for any estimated loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred 
and the amount of probable loss can be estimated."
"Litigation accruals recorded in accrued and other current liabilities as 
of December 31, 2023 and 2022 totaled $4.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively."

Enzymatics in 2015 and was later acquired by Invitae in 2021) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sued 
QIAGEN for patent infringement."
"In August 2021, a federal jury ruled that QIAGEN infringed two patents owned by 
ArcherDX and awarded damages of $4.7  million which were accrued in 2021 and, as of December  31, 2023, are

"federal court against Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc."
"(Bio-Rad) seeking a 
declaratory judgment of non-infringement of certain Bio-Rad patents related to digital PCR technology."
"In July 2023, the

respective digital PCR technologies."
"Other Litigation Matters
For all other matters, a total of $4.8 million is accrued as of December 31, 2023 in accrued and other current liabilities."
"The estimated range of possible losses for these other matters as of December 31, 2023 is between $4.0 million and 
$10.1 million."
"Based on the facts known to QIAGEN and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that such litigation 
will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations above the amounts accrued."
"However, the outcome of these matters is ultimately uncertain."
"Any settlements or judgments against us in excess of 
management's expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash 
flows."
"Segment Information
We operate as one operating segment."

The intercompany portions of such net sales are excluded to derive consolidated net sales.
"No single customer

"We issue Treasury Shares to satisfy option exercises and 
award releases."
"Stock Units
Stock units represent rights to receive Common Shares at a future date and include restricted stock units which are subject 
to time-vesting only and performance stock units which include performance conditions in addition to time-vesting."
"The final 
number of performance stock units earned is based on the performance achievement which for some grants can reach up 
to 200% of the granted shares."
"There is no exercise price and the fair market value at the time of the grant is recognized 
over the requisite vesting period."
"The fair market value is determined based on the number of stock units granted and the 
market value of our shares on the grant date."
Pre-vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately 6.0%.
"At 
December  31, 2023, there was $59.8 million remaining in unrecognized compensation cost including estimated 
forfeitures related to these awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.34 years."
"The weighted average grant date fair value of stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and

"Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the 
applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees."
"As a result, fewer shares are issued than

treasury shares."

We have not granted stock options since 2013."
"A summary of the status of employee stock options as of December 31, 
2023 and changes during the year then ended is presented below."
"The actual tax benefit for the tax deductions from option 
exercises totaled $0.1 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and $2.2 million during the year

thousand options were exercisable at a weighted average price of $18.68 and $17.79 per share, respectively."
"The lower share-based compensation expense in cost of sales in 2021 resulted from forfeitures upon the separation of an 
executive who received a cash severance payment in lieu of accelerated vesting upon separation per the terms of the 
arrangement."
The cash separation accrual offset the share-based compensation forfeiture.
"Employee Benefits
We maintain various benefit plans, including defined contribution and defined benefit plans."
"defined contribution 
plan is qualified under Section  401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and covers substantially all U.S."

Service."
This plan includes a provision for us to match a portion of employee contributions.
"Total expenses under the 
401(k) plans were $4.5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and $4.3 million for the year 
ended December  31, 2021."
We also have a defined contribution plan which covers certain executives.
"We make 
matching contributions up to an established maximum."
"Matching contributions made to the plan, and expensed, totaled 
approximately $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and $0.2 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2021."
"These defined benefit plans provide benefits to 
covered individuals satisfying certain age and/or service requirements."
"For certain plans, we calculate the vested benefits 
to which employees are entitled if they separate immediately."
"The benefits accrued on a pro-rata basis during the 
employees’ employment period are based on the individuals’ salaries, adjusted for inflation."
"All defined benefit plans are 
unfunded."
"The liability under the defined benefit plans totaled $7.4 million and $7.2 million as of December 31, 2023 
and 2022, respectively, and is included as a component of other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated 
balance sheets."
"Related Party Transactions
From time to time, we have transactions with other companies in which we hold an interest as summarized in the table 
below."
"As of December 31, 2022, prepaid expenses and other current assets included a $10.6 million convertible note from 
Ellume Limited, Australia, which bears interest at 10% and was due on December 31, 2022."
"As of December 31, 2022, 
we retained the loan receivable, while fully reserved, as we awaited the outcome of voluntary administration and any 
creditor arrangement."
"During 2023, we had no possibility of collection from Ellume and no expectation of any recovery of 
the defaulted amount."
"Accordingly, the loan receivable was fully written off against the reserve in 2023."
"Set forth below is a summary of certain 
provisions of our Articles of Association, as lastly amended on January 29, 
2024 (the Articles), and Dutch law, where appropriate."
"The below also 
contains information on provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 
2022, (the Dutch Code), which contains principles of good corporate 
governance and best practice provisions that regulate relations between the 
Managing Board, the Supervisory Board and the Shareholders."
"The principles 
and provisions are aimed at defining responsibilities for sustainable long-term 
value creation, risk control, effective management and supervision, 
remuneration and the relationship with Shareholders, including the General 
Meeting, and other stakeholders."
"A listed company should either comply, or if 
not, explain in its management report why and to what extent it does not 
comply, with the principles of the Dutch Code."
"The Dutch Code has been taken 
into account in the summary below."
"This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by 
reference to the Articles, Dutch Law and the Dutch Code."
"Managing Directors
QIAGEN shall be managed by a Managing Board consisting of one or more 
Managing Directors under the supervision of the Supervisory Board."
"The 
Managing Board is responsible for our continuity and our affiliated enterprise."
"Managing Directors shall be 
appointed by the General Meeting upon the joint meeting of the Supervisory 
Board and the Managing Board (Joint Meeting), having made a binding 
nomination for each vacancy."
"However, the General Meeting may at all times 
overrule the binding nature of such a nomination by a resolution adopted by at 
least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, if such majority represents more 
than half the issued share capital."
"This is different from the provisions of many 
American corporate statutes, including the Delaware General Corporation 
Law, which give the directors of a corporation greater authority in choosing 
the executive officers of a corporation."
"The 
Supervisory Board shall also at all times be entitled to suspend (but not to 
dismiss) a Managing Director."
"The Articles provide that the Supervisory Board 
may adopt management board rules governing the internal organization of the 
Managing Board."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board shall determine the salary, the bonus, if 
any, and the other compensation terms and conditions of service of the 
Managing Directors within the scope of the remuneration policy."
"The current 
remuneration policy of the Managing Board was adopted in our Annual 
General Meeting on June 29, 2021."
"Resolutions of the Managing Board shall be validly adopted, if adopted by 
simple majority of votes, at least one of whom voting in favor of the proposal 
must be the Chairman."
Each Managing Director has the right to cast one vote.
"Under Dutch law, in the event that there is a conflict of interest between a 
Managing Director and us and our business on a certain matter, that 
Managing Director shall not participate in the discussions and voting on that 
matter."
"If all Managing Directors have a conflict of interest, such resolution

shall be adopted by the Supervisory Board."
"If all Supervisory Directors have a 
conflict of interest as well, the General Meeting will be authorized to resolve 
on the matter."
"According to the Dutch Code, any conflict of interest or 
apparent conflict of interest between the Company and Managing Directors 
should be prevented."
"To avoid conflicts of interest, adequate measures should 
be taken."
"Under the Dutch Code, the Supervisory Board is responsible for the 
decision-making on dealing with conflicts of interest regarding Managing 
Directors, Supervisory Directors and majority shareholders in relation to us."
"A 
Managing Director should report any potential conflict of interest in a 
transaction that is of material significance to the Company and/or to such 
Managing Director to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and to the other 
members of the Managing Board without delay."
"The Supervisory Board should 
decide, outside the presence of the Managing Director, whether there is a 
conflict of interest."
"All transactions in which there are conflicts of interest with 
Managing Directors shall be agreed on terms that are customary in the sector 
concerned."
"Decisions to enter into transactions under which a Supervisory 
Director would have a conflict of interest that are of material significance to 
QIAGEN and/or to the Managing Director concerned, require the approval of 
the Supervisory Board."
"Supervisory Directors
The Supervisory Board shall be responsible for supervising the policy pursued 
by the Managing Board and our general course of affairs."
"Under our Articles, 
the Supervisory Directors are required to serve the interests of our Company 
and our business and the interest of all stakeholders (which includes but is not 
limited to our shareholders) in fulfilling their duties."
"The Supervisory Board shall 
consist of such number of members as the Joint Meeting may from time to time 
determine, with a minimum of three members."
"The Supervisory Directors shall 
be appointed by the General Meeting upon the Joint Meeting having made a 
binding nomination for each vacancy."
"However, the General Meeting may at 
all times overrule the binding nature of such a nomination by a resolution 
adopted by at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, if such majority 
represents more than half the issued share capital."
"This is different from the provisions 
of many American corporate statutes, including the Delaware General 
Corporation Law, which provides that directors may vote to fill vacancies on 
the board of directors of a corporation."
"Under Dutch law, in the event that there is a conflict of interest between a 
Supervisory Director and us and our business on a certain matter, that 
Supervisory Director shall not participate in the discussions and voting on that 
matter."
"Under the Dutch Code, a Supervisory Director should report any 
conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest in a transaction that is of 
material significance to the Company and/or to such Supervisory Director to 
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board without delay."
"The Supervisory Board 
should decide, outside the presence of the Supervisory Director concerned, 
whether there is a conflict of interest."
"If all Supervisory Directors have a conflict 
of interest, the relevant resolution shall be adopted by the General Meeting."
"All 
transactions in which there are conflicts of interest with Supervisory Directors 
shall be agreed on terms that are customary in the sector concerned."
"Decisions 
to enter into transactions under which a Supervisory Director would have a 
conflict of interest that are of material significance to QIAGEN and/or to the 
Supervisory Director concerned, require the approval of the Supervisory 
Board."
"In accordance with Dutch law and the Dutch Code, the General Meeting 
determines the compensation of the Supervisory Directors upon the proposal of 
the Compensation Committee with due observance of the remuneration policy 
for Supervisory Directors as adopted at the 2021 Annual General Meeting."
"Under the Dutch Code, any shares held by a Supervisory Director in the 
Company on whose board he or she sits should be long-term investments."
"Under certain circumstances, 
however, they may become liable, either towards QIAGEN (internal liability) 
or to others (external liability), although some exceptions are described below."
"Liability towards QIAGEN
Failure of a Managing Director or Supervisory Director to perform his or her 
duties does not automatically lead to liability."
"Liability is only incurred in the 
case of a clear, indisputable shortcoming about which no reasonably judging 
business-person would have any doubt."
"In addition, the Managing Director or 
Supervisory Director must be deemed to have been grossly negligent."
"Managing Directors are jointly and severally liable for failure of the Managing 
Board as a whole, but an individual Managing Director will not be held liable 
if he or she is determined not to have been responsible for the mismanagement 
and has not been negligent in preventing its consequences."
"Moreover, a Managing Director or Supervisory Director may be found to be 
criminally liable if he or she deliberately publishes false annual accounts or 
deliberately allows the publication of such false annual accounts."
"Tort Liability
Under Dutch law, there can be liability if one has committed a tort 
(onrechtmatige daad) against another person."
"Although there is no clear 
definition of “tort” under Dutch law, breach of a duty of care towards a third 
party is generally considered to be a tort."
"Therefore, a Dutch corporation may 
be held liable by any third party under the general rule of Dutch laws 
regarding tort claims."
"In exceptional cases, Managing Directors and 
Supervisory Directors have been found liable on the basis of tort under Dutch 
common law, but it is generally difficult to hold a Managing Director or 
Supervisory Director personally liable for a tort claim."
"Shareholders cannot 
base a tort claim on any losses which derive from and coincide with losses we 
suffered."
"In such cases, only we can sue the Managing Directors or 
Supervisory Directors."
"Criminal Liability
Under Dutch law, if a legal entity has committed a criminal offense, criminal 
proceedings may be instituted against the legal entity itself as well as against 
those who gave order to or were in charge of the forbidden act."
"As a general 
rule, it is held that a Managing Director is only criminally liable if he or she 
played a reasonably active role in the criminal act."
"An 
exception is made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such 
person shall have been adjudged to be liable for gross negligence or willful 
misconduct in the performance of his or her duty to us."
"Classes of Shares
The authorized classes of our shares consist of Common Shares, Financing 
Preference Shares and Preference Shares."
"No Financing Preference Shares or

income tax consequences to holders of our Common Shares who are “U.S."
"Holders” (as such term is defined below) and certain material Netherlands tax 
consequences to holders of our Common Shares who are “non-resident 
Shareholders” or “Shareholders” (as each term is defined below)."
"This 
summary does not discuss every aspect of such taxation that may be relevant 
to such holders."
"Therefore, all prospective purchasers of our Common Shares 
described above are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to 
the United States federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as the 
Netherlands tax consequences, of the ownership of our Common Shares."

with currently enacted laws which are not in force as of this date have not 
been addressed in this description."
"Netherlands Tax Considerations
The following describes the material tax consequences under Netherlands law 
of an investment in our Common Shares."
"Dividend Withholding Tax
General
Upon distribution of dividends, we are obligated to withhold 15% dividend tax 
at source and to pay the amount withheld to the Netherlands taxing 
authorities."

participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights that is

the Netherlands."

withholding tax, unless derived from our paid-in share premium that is 
recognized as equity for Netherlands tax purposes."

sale or disposition of our Common Shares to persons other than QIAGEN and 
our affiliates."
"A disposition of our Common Shares to QIAGEN or to our 
affiliates should in general be subject to withholding tax."
This general exemption does not apply to abusive structures.
"A structure is 
deemed abusive if a corporate Shareholder owns our Common Shares with the 
main purpose or one of the main purposes to avoid tax for another person and 
the structure is considered artificial (i.e., not put into place for valid 
commercial reasons that reflect economic reality)."
"This domestic exemption 
may under conditions further not apply in case of hybrid mismatches."
"A corporate Shareholder may also be eligible for relief of Netherlands 
dividend withholding tax under Netherlands tax law, or under a tax 
convention that is in force between the country of residence of the Shareholder 
and the Netherlands."
"Shareholders 
The regular 15% dividend withholding tax is withheld by us on dividends we 
pay to a resident of the United States."
"Shareholder that 
cannot benefit from the Dutch domestic exemption (as explained above), 
withholding tax on dividends may still be reduced to 5% or 0% if the recipient 
is entitled to benefits under the Tax Convention between the Netherlands and 
QIAGEN N.V."

this determination can be made in general depends on the facts presented and 
in particular on the activities performed by the Shareholder."

Government Regulations
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the European Union, the 
United States and other countries."
"European Union Regulations
In the European Union, in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) had been 
regulated under EU-Directive 98/79/EC (IVD Directive) and corresponding 
national provisions."
"The IVD Directive required that medical devices meet the 
essential requirements, including those relating to device safety and efficacy, 
set out in an annex of the Directive."
"IVD medical devices, other than devices for performance evaluation, must bear 
the CE marking of conformity when they are placed on the European market."
"The CE mark is a declaration by the manufacturer that the product meets all the 
appropriate provisions of the applicable legislation implementing the relevant 
European Directive."
"As a general rule, the manufacturer must follow the EU 
declaration of conformity procedure to obtain or apply a CE mark."
"In May 2022, the Directive was replaced by the In Vitro Diagnostic Device 
Regulation (IVDR) (EU) 2017/746 that was published in May 2017 and given 
a 5-year transition period until its full implementation on May 26, 2022."
"Unlike the IVD Directive, the IVDR has binding legal force throughout every 
Member State."
"The major goal of the IVDR was to standardize diagnostic 
procedures within the EU, increase reliability of diagnostic analysis and 
enhance patient safety."
"Under the IVDR as enacted by the European 
Commission (EC), IVDs are subject to additional legal regulatory requirements."
"Among other things, the IVDR introduces a new risk-based classification system 
and requirements for conformity assessments."
"More recently on January 23, 2024 the European Commission has 
published a legislative proposal which would extend the time for legacy IVDs 
to transition to the IVD regulation."
"Nonetheless, the manufacturers of such 
devices must comply with specific requirements in the IVDR according to the 
timelines established, but ultimately, such products, as with all new IVDs, will 
have to undergo the IVDR’s conformity assessment procedures."
"Under the IVD 
Directive the majority of QIAGEN products were classified as self-declared, 
while under the IVDR most of QIAGEN products will require pre-approval, and 
those that are in the highest risk class will have to be tested by a Designated 
Reference Laboratory."
"In addition, the IVDR imposes additional requirements 
relating to post-market surveillance and submission of post-market performance 
follow-up reports."
"The EC has designated twelve (12) Notified Bodies to perform conformity 
assessments under the IVDR, including QIAGEN’s Notified Bodies, TÜV 
Rheinland and BSI."
"MedTech Europe has issued guidance relating to the IVDR 
in several areas, e.g., clinical benefit, technical documentation, state of art, 
accessories, and EUDAMED."

other personal information."
"We have implemented the requirements set forth 
by the GDPR, which took effect on May 25, 2018."
"GDPR and other EU data 
privacy and security laws impact our business either directly or indirectly."
"Our 
failure to comply with applicable privacy or security laws or significant 
changes in these laws could significantly impact our business and future 
business plans."
"For example, we may be subject to regulatory action, fines, or 
lawsuits in the event we fail to comply with applicable privacy laws."
"We may 
face significant liability in the event any of the personal information we 
maintain is lost or otherwise subject to misuse or other wrongful use, access or 
disclosure."
"United Kingdom
The U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU has major ramifications for IVD 
manufacturers."
"Among other things, companies now have to follow new 
procedures that apply in the U.K., including appointment of a U.K."
"Responsible 
Person rather than relying on European Authorized Representatives, to manage 
their compliance efforts in the U.K."
"Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued 
guidance on how the country will regulate IVDs after January 1, 2021."
"According to MHRA, IVDs will require certification in the U.K., which is 
defined as England, Scotland and Wales, while companies will still be able to 
sell tests in Northern Ireland under existing EU IVD regulations."
"Under 
subsequent amendments to MHRA guidance, MHRA will continue to recognize 
CE marks for IVDs certified under the IVD Directive until the earlier of June 30, 
2028 or the expiration of the certificate and for IVDs certified under the IVDR 
until June 30, 2028."
"Companies must register with the MHRA before placing 
IVDs on the U.K."
To continue marketing CE marked IVDs in the U.K.
"once the designated MHRA recognition period has lapsed, companies selling 
in the U.K."
"will have to obtain a new marking authorization, called a U.K."
"Conformity Assessed mark (UKCA), for each IVD product."
"United States
In the United States, in vitro diagnostic products are subject to regulation by 
the FDA as medical devices to the extent that they are intended for use in the 
diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease or other conditions."
"As LDTs have increased in complexity, the FDA has 
taken steps towards developing a risk-based approach to the regulation of 
LDTs; however, most LDTs currently remain under FDA enforcement discretion."
"Congress has also signaled interest in clarifying the regulatory landscape for 
LDTs."
"Following several years of inaction by Congress on this issue, the FDA 
issued a proposed rule in October 2023 to regulate LDTs under the current 
medical device framework and proposing to phase out the current enforcement 
discretion policy; the public comment period ended in early December 2023."
"However, the likelihood of the FDA finalizing the 
proposed rule in April 2024 (as is currently projected), as well as potential 
litigation challenging the agency’s authority to take such action, is uncertain at 
this time."
"Separately, members of Congress have been working with stakeholders for 
several years on a possible bill to regulate in vitro clinical tests including LDTs."
"For example, legislation called the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT 
Development (VALID) Act, as drafted and re-introduced for consideration by 
the current Congress, would codify into law the term “in vitro clinical 
QIAGEN N.V."
"The new IVCT product 
category would include products currently regulated as IVDs, in addition to 
LDTs."
"The proposed regulatory framework adopts various concepts from the 
FDCA, utilizing a risk-based approach that aims to ensure that all marketed 
IVCTs have a reasonable assurance of both analytical and clinical validity."
"It is unclear whether the VALID Act will be passed by Congress in its current 
form or signed into law by the President; if enacted, however, it is expected to 
require clinical laboratories to spend significant time, resources, and money 
towards ensuring compliance."
"Medical devices, including IVDs, are classified into one of three classes 
depending on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably 
assure their safety and effectiveness."
"Class II devices are generally subject to premarket notification (or 
510(k) clearance), general controls and special controls, including 
performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries or FDA 
guidance documents describing device-specific special controls."
"Class III 
devices are subject to most of the previously identified requirements as well as 
to premarket approval (PMA)."
"The payment of a user fee, which is typically 
adjusted annually, to the FDA is usually required upon filing a premarket 
submission (e.g., premarket notification, premarket approval application, or 
De Novo classification request) for FDA review."
510(k) Premarket Notification.
"A 510(k) premarket notification requires the 
sponsor to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to 
another marketed device, termed a “predicate device,” that is legally marketed 
in the United States and is not subject to premarket approval."
"If 
the FDA determines that the applicant’s device is substantially equivalent to the 
identified predicate device(s), the agency will issue a 510(k) clearance letter 
that authorizes commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific 
indications for use."
"De Novo Classification 
If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) 
premarket notification process because no predicate device to which it is 
substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified 
into Class III."
"However, if such a device would be considered low or moderate 
risk (in other words, it does not rise to the level of requiring the approval of a 
PMA), it may be eligible for the De Novo classification process."
"The De Novo 
classification process allows a device developer to request that the novel 
medical device be reclassified as either a Class I or Class II device, rather than 
having it regulated as a high risk Class III device subject to the PMA 
requirements."
"If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the 
classification request must include a draft proposal for special controls that are 
QIAGEN N.V."

necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of 
the medical device."
"Premarket Approval
The PMA process is more complex, costly and time consuming than either the 
510(k) process or De Novo classification."
"A PMA must be supported by more 
detailed and comprehensive scientific evidence, including clinical data, to 
demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the medical device for its intended 
purpose."
"A clinical trial involving a “significant risk” device may not begin until 
the sponsor submits an investigational device exemption (IDE) application to 
the FDA and obtains approval to begin the trial."
"After the PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to make a threshold 
determination that the PMA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive 
review."
"If the PMA is complete, the FDA will file the PMA and begin the 
substantive review process."
"The FDA is subject to a performance goal review 
time for a PMA that is 180 days from the date of filing, although in practice 
this review time is longer."
"Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data 
and referrals to advisory committees may delay the process considerably."
"The 
total process may take several years and there is no guarantee that the PMA 
will ever be approved."
"Even if approved, the FDA may limit the indications for 
which the device may be marketed."
"The FDA may also request additional 
clinical data as a condition of approval or after the PMA is approved."
"Any 
changes to the medical device may require a supplemental PMA to be 
submitted and approved before the modified device may be marketed."
"Device manufacturers are required 
to register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA and are 
subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies."
"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secretary of the U.S."
"Manufacturers of several 
types of SARS-CoV-2 assays have been granted EUAs, including QIAGEN."
"The 
FDA has indicated the withdrawal of EUAs for COVID-19 countermeasures will 
be done in a gradual, phased process and issued final guidance on a 
transitional plan."
"The FDA defines an IVD companion 
diagnostic device as a device that provides information that is essential for the 
safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product."
"The FDA has not yet provided much guidance 
on the regulation and use of complementary diagnostics, but several have 
been approved."
"| Annual Report 2023

Appendices
The FDA indicated that it will apply a risk-based approach to determine the 
regulatory pathway for IVD companion diagnostic devices, as it does with all 
medical devices."
"This means that the regulatory pathway will depend on the 
level of risk to patients, based on the intended use of the IVD companion 
diagnostic device and the controls necessary to provide a reasonable 
assurance of safety and effectiveness."
"We expect that any IVD companion 
diagnostic device that we develop will utilize the PMA pathway and that a 
clinical trial performed under an IDE will have to be completed before the PMA 
may be submitted."
"The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an IVD 
companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and 
that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD 
companion diagnostic device will be developed contemporaneously."
"If the 
companion diagnostic test will be used to make critical treatment decisions 
such as patient selection, treatment assignment, or treatment arm, it will likely 
be considered a significant risk device for which a clinical trial will be 
required."
"The sponsor of the IVD companion diagnostic device will be required to 
comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements that apply to clinical trials of 
significant risk devices."
"If the diagnostic test and the therapeutic drug are 
studied together to support their respective approvals, the clinical trial must 
meet both the IDE and IND requirements."
"These types of devices are 
exempt from most regulatory controls pursuant to long-standing FDA guidance 
on RUO/IUO diagnostics."
"Because we do not promote our RUOs for clinical 
diagnostic use, or provide technical assistance to clinical laboratories with 
respect to these tests, we believe that these tests are exempt from FDA’s 
premarket review and other requirements."
"If the FDA were to disagree with our 
designation of any of these products, we could be forced to stop selling the 
product until we obtain appropriate regulatory clearance or approval."
"Further, 
it is possible that some of our RUOs may be used by some customers without 
our knowledge in their LDTs, which they may then develop, validate and 
promote for clinical use."
"However, QIAGEN does not promote these products 
for use in LDTs or assist in the development of such LDTs for clinical diagnostic 
use."
"HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Laws
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 
established comprehensive federal standards for the privacy and security of 
health information."
"Title II of HIPAA, the 
Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy 
of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying 
numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain 
healthcare transactions."
"The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of 
administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written 
security policies and procedures to maintain the security of protected health 
information."
"Congress subsequently enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) provisions of the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009."
"HITECH expanded and 
strengthened HIPAA, created new targets for enforcement, imposed new 
penalties for noncompliance and established new breach notification 
requirements for Covered Entities and Business Associates."
"| Annual Report 2023
Overview
Management Report
Corporate Governance
Financial Statements
Appendices
Page 252
Appendices
Under 'HITECH’s breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report 
breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or 
otherwise secured."
"Required breach notices must be made as soon as is 
reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the 
breach."
"Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary 
and, in some cases depending on the size of the breach, they must be 
reported through local and national media."
"Breach reports can lead to 
investigation, enforcement and civil litigation, including class action lawsuits."
"Our Redwood City entity serves in some cases as a Business Associate to 
customers who are subject to the HIPAA regulations."
"In this capacity, we 
maintain an active compliance program that is designed to identify security 
incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, 
mitigate harm or report if required by law."
"We are subject to prosecution and/
or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for 
non-compliance, including a four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted 
under HITECH."
"We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general 
who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH."
"To avoid penalties 
under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches 
of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the 
company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis."
"However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be 
subject to penalties for the underlying breach."
"California has also adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or 
CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and became enforceable by the 
state attorney general on July 1, 2020."
The regulations issued under the CCPA have been modified several times.
"Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, 
was approved by California voters in the election on November 3, 2020."
"The 
CPRA imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing 
business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, 
limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt 
outs for certain uses of sensitive data."
"It also created a new California data 
protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result 
in increased privacy and information security enforcement."
"The majority of the 
provisions became effective on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance 
investment and potential business process changes may be required."
"Similar 
laws have been adopted in other states (for example, Nevada, Virginia, 
Connecticut, Utah and Colorado) or proposed in other states and at the 
federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting 
requirements that would make compliance challenging."
"Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing 
specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results by strictly 
limiting the disclosure of those results."
"State requirements are particularly 
stringent regarding predictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic 
discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a 
high risk for disease."
"We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to 
comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, 
including genetic testing and genetic information privacy laws in all 
jurisdictions, both state and federal."
"However, these laws constantly change, 
and we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we 
do business."
"Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal 
laws regarding privacy or security could result in civil and/or criminal 
penalties, significant reputational damage and could have a material adverse 
effect on our business."
"Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Healthcare Regulations
A variety of state and federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state 
and federal healthcare programs, as well as commercial insurers."
"These laws 
are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various federal and state 
agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the 
Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Office of Inspector General for the U.S."

Department of Health and Human Services (OIG)."
"The Company seeks to 
conduct its business in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws."
"State and federal fraud and abuse laws may be interpreted and applied 
differently, and arrangements and business practices could be subject to 
scrutiny under them by federal or state enforcement agencies."
"Sanctions for 
violations of these laws could result in a wide range of penalties, including but 
not limited to significant criminal sanctions, civil fines and penalties."
"A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the AKS or 
specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation."
"Recognizing that the 
AKS is broad and potentially applies to innocuous or beneficial arrangements, 
the OIG issued regulations, commonly known as “safe harbors,” which set 
forth certain requirements that, if fully met, insulate a given arrangement or 
conduct from prosecution under the AKS."
"The AKS also has statutory 
exceptions that provide protection similar to that of safe harbors."
"If, however, 
an arrangement does not meet every requirement of an exception or safe 
harbor, the arrangement does not necessarily violate the AKS."
"A facts-and-
circumstances analysis is necessary to determine AKS compliance or lack 
thereof."
"Potential statutory penalties for violating the AKS include imprisonment 
and criminal fines."
"In addition, through application of other laws, conduct that 
violates the AKS can give rise to civil monetary penalties and possible 
exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal 
healthcare programs."
"Claims including items or services resulting from a 
violation of the AKS also constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of 
the False Claims Act."
"In addition to the federal AKS, many states have their own anti-kickback laws."
"Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they 
do not always have the same scope, exceptions, safe harbors or sanctions."
"In 
some states, these anti-kickback laws apply to both state healthcare programs 
and commercial insurers."
"The penalties for violating state anti-kickback 
provisions can be severe, including criminal and civil penalties (including 
penalties under the state false claims law), imprisonment, and exclusion from 
state healthcare programs."
"The FCA also prohibits the knowing retention of 
overpayments (sometimes referred to as “reverse false claims”)."
"In addition, the FCA permits a private individual acting as a 
“whistleblower” (also referred to as a “relator”) to bring FCA actions on behalf 
of the federal government under the statute’s qui tam provisions, and to share 
in any monetary recovery."
"The federal government may elect or decline to 
intervene in such matters, but if the government declines intervention, the 
whistleblower may still proceed with the litigation on the government’s behalf."
"Penalties for violating the FCA include payment of up to three times the actual 
damages sustained by the government, plus substantial per-claim statutory 
penalties, as well as possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare 
programs."
"There is also a federal criminal false claims statute that prohibits, in pertinent 
part, the making or presentation of a false claim, knowing such claim to be 
false, to any person or officer in the civil, military, or naval service or any 
department or agency thereof."
"Potential penalties for violating this statute 
include fines or imprisonment."
"Health Care Fraud and False Statements
The federal healthcare fraud statute criminalizes, in pertinent part, knowingly 
and willfully defrauding a healthcare benefit program, which is defined to 
include commercial insurers."
"A violation of this statute may result in fines, 
imprisonment, or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs."
"A 
violation of this statute may result in fines or imprisonment."
"The potential penalties for violating the CMP Law include 
exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, substantial fines, 
and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature 
of the offense."
"For reporting beginning January 1, 2022, U.S.-licensed physician assistants, 
clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse-midwives, certified nurse anesthetists, 
and nurse practitioners must be included in the provider types subject to 
Sunshine Act reporting."
"The reporting program (known as the Open Payments 
program) is administered by CMS."
"There are also an increasing number of state “sunshine” laws that require 
manufacturers to provide reports to state governments on pricing and 
marketing information."
"Failure to comply with the Sunshine Act or state equivalents could result in civil 
monetary penalties, among other sanctions, depending upon the nature of the 
violation."
"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Despite extensive procedures to ensure compliance, we may also be exposed 
to liabilities under the U.S."
"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which

"We are also subject to a 
number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering, 
international money transfers and electronic fund transfers."
"These laws apply to 
companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents."
"Environment, Health and Safety
We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the 
environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, 
transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous 
waste and radioactive materials."
"Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (OSHA) has established extensive requirements 
relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S."
"This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to 
protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, such as HIV and 
hepatitis B and C, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through 
needle stick injuries."
"For purposes of transportation, some biological materials 
and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject 
to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S."
"Department of 
Transportation, the U.S."
"Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service 
and the International Air Transport Association."
"Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) has also promulgated regulations setting forth 
importation, labelling, and registration requirements, among others, which 
may apply to certain products and/or establishments of the company."
"These laws and regulations typically 
require the licensing of manufacturing facilities, as well as controlled research, 
testing and governmental authorization of product candidates."
"Additionally, 
they may require adherence to good manufacturing, clinical and laboratory 
practices."
"We must obtain approval from regulatory authorities in all countries where we 
distribute our products."
"The requirements governing the conduct of product 
authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country."
"If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be 
subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory 
approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, or 
criminal prosecution."
"For many years, federal and state governments in the United States 
have pursued methods to reduce the cost of healthcare delivery."
"For example, 
in 2010, the United States enacted major healthcare reform legislation known 
as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)."
"Such changes have 
had, and are expected to continue to have, an impact on our business."
"In addition, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other 
things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress."
"A Joint Select 
Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit 
reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was 
unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic 
reduction to several government programs."
"This includes aggregate reductions 
of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, and, due to 
subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2032 unless 
additional Congressional action is taken."
"We frequently identify value propositions on our products and communicate 
them to payors, providers, and patient stakeholders and attempt to positively

impact coverage, coding and payment pathways."
"However, we have no direct 
control over payor decisions with respect to coverage and payment levels for 
our products."
"Changes in reimbursement levels or methods may positively or 
negatively affect sales of our products in any given country for any given 
product."
"At QIAGEN, we work with several specialized reimbursement 
consulting companies and maintain regular contact with payors."
"As government programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their 
citizens, they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the 
amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures, products or 
services."
"Many third-party payors have developed payment and delivery 
mechanisms to support cost control efforts and to focus on paying for quality."
"Such mechanisms include payment reductions, pay-for-performance metrics, 
quality-based performance payments, restrictive coverage policies, studies to 
compare effectiveness and patient outcomes, and technology assessments."
"These changes have increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective 
and quality-driven healthcare."
"Code Assignment
In the United States, a third-party payor's decisions regarding coverage and 
payment are impacted, in large part, by the specific Current Procedural 
Terminology (CPT) code used to identify a test."
"The American Medical 
Association (AMA) publishes the CPT, which identifies codes, along with 
descriptions, for reporting medical services and procedures."
"The purpose of 
the CPT is to provide a uniform language that accurately describes medical, 
surgical, and diagnostic services and therefore to ensure reliable nationwide 
communication among healthcare providers, patients, and third-party payors."
"CMS uses its own Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) 
codes for medical billing and reimbursement purposes."
"Level I HCPCS codes 
are comprised of current CPT codes, while Level II HCPCS codes primarily 
represent non-physician services and Level III HCPCS codes are local codes 
developed by Medicaid agencies, Medicare contractors and commercial 
insurers."
"Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA) Codes are an addition to the 
CPT® code set approved by the AMA CPT® Editorial Panel."
"They are alpha-
numeric CPT codes with a corresponding descriptor for labs or manufacturers 
that want to more specifically identify their test."
"A manufacturer of in vitro diagnostic kits or a provider of laboratory services 
may request establishment of a Category I CPT code for a new product or a 
PLA Code or both."
"In addition, Z-Code identifiers are unique five-character 
alphanumeric tracking codes associated with a specific molecular diagnostic 
test."
"When a claim is submitted, it includes the associated CPT code and the Z-
Code identifier is entered as a device code."
"Assignment of a specific CPT code 
ensures routine processing and payment for a diagnostic test by both 
commercial insurers and government payors."
"The AMA has specific procedures for establishing a new CPT code and, if 
appropriate, for modifying existing nomenclature to incorporate a new test into 
an existing code."
"If the AMA concludes that a new code or modification of 
nomenclature is unnecessary, the AMA will inform the requestor how to use 
one or more existing codes to report the test."
"While the AMA's decision is pending, billing and collection may be sought 
under an existing, non-specific CPT code."
"A manufacturer or provider may 
decide not to request assignment of a CPT code and instead use an existing, 
non-specific code for reimbursement purposes."
"However, use of such codes 
may result in more frequent denials and/or requests for supporting clinical 
documentation from the third-party payor and in lower reimbursement rates, 
which may vary based on geographical location."
"CMS reimbursement rates for clinical diagnostic tests are defined by CPT and 
HCPCS codes in the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS)."
"In 2012, the 
AMA added 127 new CPT codes for molecular pathology services that 
became effective on January 1, 2013."
"These new CPT codes are biomarker 
specific and were designed to replace the previous methodology of billing for 
molecular pathology testing, which involved “stacking” a series of non-
biomarker specific CPT codes together to describe the testing performed."

issued final national reimbursement prices for the new CPT codes in November 
2013."
"As of January 1, 2018, in accordance with the Protecting Access to Medicare 
Act of 2014 (PAMA), applicable laboratories are required to report to CMS 
commercial insurer payment rates and volumes for their tests."
"CMS uses the 
data reported and the HCPCS code associated with the test to calculate a 
weighted median payment rate for each test, which is used to establish revised 
Medicare CLFS reimbursement rates for certain clinical diagnostic laboratory 
tests (CDLTs), subject to certain phase-in limits."
"For a CDLT that is assigned a 
new or substantially revised CPT code, the initial payment rate is assigned 
using the gap-fill methodology."
"Laboratories offering ADLTs are subject to recoupment if 
the actual list charge exceeds the weighted median private payor rate by a 
certain amount."
"Since December 2019, Congress has passed a series of laws to modify 
PAMA’s statutory requirements related to the data reporting period and phase-
in of payment reductions under the CLFS for CDLTs that are not ADLTs."
"Most 
recently, the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 
2024 (Pub."
"118-22, enacted on November 16, 2023) further delayed the 
reporting requirement as well as the application of the 15 percent phase-in 
reduction."
"Under these statutory provisions, the next data reporting period for 
CDLTs that are not ADLTs will be January 1, 2025 through March 31, 2025, 
and will be based on the most recent data collection period of January 1, 
2019 through June 30, 2019."
"After this data reporting period, the three-year 
data reporting cycle for these tests will resume (e.g., 2028, 2031, etc.)."
"The Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions 
Act of 2024 further applied a 0.0 reduction limit for calendar year 2024."
"As 
a result, payment may not be reduced by more than 15 percent per year for 
calendar years 2025, 2026, and 2027, as compared to the payment amount 
established for a test the prior year."
"CMS’s methodology under PAMA (as well as the willingness of commercial 
insurers to recognize the value of diagnostic testing and pay for that testing 
accordingly) renders commercial insurer payment levels even more significant."
"This calculation methodology has resulted in significant reductions in 
reimbursement, even though CMS imposed caps on those reductions."
"Given 
the many uncertainties built into PAMA’s price-setting process, it is difficult to 
predict how payments made by CMS under the CLFS may change from year to 
year."
"Coverage Decisions
When deciding whether to cover a particular diagnostic test, third-party payors 
generally consider whether the test is a medically necessary and, if so, 
whether the test will directly impact clinical decision making."
"For coverage, the 
testing method should be considered scientifically valid to identify the specific 
gene biomarker or gene mutation, and must have been demonstrated to 
improve clinical outcomes for the patient’s condition."
"Coverage of a drug 
therapy and its companion diagnostic for cancer treatment indications may be 
validated by a NCCN category 1, 2A or 2B recommendation."
"However, most 
third-party payors do not cover experimental services."
"Coverage 
determinations are often influenced by current standards of practice and 
clinical data, particularly at the local level."
"CMS has the authority to make 
coverage determinations on a national basis, but most Medicare coverage 
decisions are made at the local level by contractors that administer the 
Medicare program in specified geographic areas."
"Commercial insurers and 
government payors have separate processes for making coverage

determinations, and commercial insurer may or may not follow Medicare's 
coverage decisions."
"If a third-party payor has a coverage determination in 
place for a particular diagnostic test, billing for that test must comply with the 
established policy."
"Otherwise, the third-party payor makes reimbursement 
decisions on a case-by-case basis."
"Payment
Payment for covered diagnostic tests is determined based on various 
methodologies, including prospective payment systems and fee schedules."
"In 
addition, commercial insurers may negotiate contractual rates with 
participating providers, establish fee schedule rates, or set rates as a 
percentage of the billed charge."
"Diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare 
inpatients generally are included in the bundled payment made to the hospital 
under Medicare's Inpatient Prospective Payment System, utilizing Diagnosis 
Related Groups (DRGs) depending on the patient’s condition."
"Payment rates 
for diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in outpatient settings 
are the lesser of the amount billed, the local fee for a geographic area, or a 
national limit."
"Each year, the fee schedule is updated for inflation and could be 
modified by Congress in accordance with the CLFS rules and provisions."
"Medicaid programs generally pay for diagnostic tests based on a fee 
schedule, but reimbursement varies by geographic region."
"European Union
In the European Union, the reimbursement mechanisms used by private and 
public health insurers vary by country."
"For the public systems, reimbursement is 
determined by guidelines established by the legislator or responsible national 
authority."
"As elsewhere, inclusion in reimbursement catalogues focuses on the 
medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the 
healthcare system."
"Acceptance for reimbursement comes with cost, use, and 
often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country."
"Exchange Controls
There are currently no limitations either under the laws of the Netherlands or in 
our Articles, to the rights of shareholders from outside the Netherlands to hold 
or vote Common Shares."
"Under current foreign exchange regulations in the 
Netherlands, there are no material limitations on the amount of cash payments 
that we may remit to residents of foreign countries."

regulations of the SEC that apply to foreign private issuers."

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Managing Directors, with the assistance of other members of 
management, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and 
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures."
"Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not 
prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance of 
achieving their control objectives."
"In addition, any determination of 
effectiveness of controls is not a projection of any effectiveness of those controls 
to future periods, as those controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate."
"Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting 
during 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially 
affect, our internal control over financial reporting."
