"Powering towards  
a green tomorrow."
"Annual Report 2023
Our energy for a sustainable life."
"We are driving the energy transition – with growth investments that 
add social and economic value."
"Despite the increasingly challenging 
environment, our investment programme is progressing faster than 
anticipated."
"At the end of 2023, we set new ambitious targets: 
between 2024 and 2030, we want to invest around €55 billion in  
new wind and solar farms, battery storage solutions, flexible back-up 
capacity and electrolysers for hydrogen production."
"In doing so, we 
want to expand our generation capacity in our green core business 
from 35.5 GW today to more than 65 GW."
"At the same time, we will be 
making a socially acceptable exit from coal-fired generation by 2030."
"Our 20,000+ strong workforce is wholeheartedly dedicated to 
harnessing the benefits of a secure, affordable and increasingly 
climate-friendly electricity supply for businesses and society as a 
whole."
"This commitment is expressed in our purpose: Our energy for a 
sustainable life."
It is what sets RWE apart.
"And we will remain true to this 
conviction as we continue our journey down this road."
"Just as we have 
done with our product, electricity."
"Last year, RWE celebrated its 125th anniversary."
"We can look back on 
an eventful journey shaped by rapid social and technological change."
"But one part of our story has always remained the same: our product, 
electricity."
The only difference now is how we generate that electricity.
We produced our very first megawatt hour from hard coal.
"Later, lignite 
and nuclear were our main energy sources."
"Today, they have been 
replaced with wind, sun, water and natural gas."
"Tomorrow, we will make 
a full transition to zero-carbon energy sources."
"Because our objective 
is to be carbon neutral."
"And we want to ­
accomplish this by 2040."
Green energy is the lifeblood of a sustainable economy.
"And demand 
for it is also rising outside of the energy sector."
"Be it in industry, 
­
transport or buildings, fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas must be 
replaced by zero-carbon energy sources everywhere."
"And where it is 
not possible to switch to carbon-neutral electricity directly, for example 
when producing steel, hydrogen is a suitable alternative – hydrogen 
produced using electricity from renewables."
"This, too, presents us with 
significant opportunities."

"The suffering of those affected continues to 
move us all, and our thoughts and support are with those forced to endure these horrors."
"I deeply hope that 2024 provides the much-needed breakthroughs, so peace may return to 
the afflicted regions and bring about an end to the misery."
"In contrast, the situation on the energy markets notably relaxed in 2023."
"Europe’s energy 
supply has become more resilient to crises and security of supply was ensured in the winter 
months."
2023 was our company’s 125th anniversary year and it was very successful one at that.
"We 
exceeded our profit targets by a significant margin."
"All segments with the exception of 
Coal / Nuclear earned more than in 2022."
"At €8.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA in our core 
business was around €2 billion above both the forecast range and the previous year’s figure."
"High earnings from energy trading and the commercial optimisation of our power plant 
dispatch played a big part."
"The successful execution of our growth strategy was another 
major contributing factor."
"I would like to single out our acquisition of Con Edison Clean 
Energy Businesses for special mention – it was a move which propelled us to the rank of 
major renewables player in the USA."
"And, on top of that, we commissioned a number of new 
wind and solar farms, which buoyed earnings further."
"The fact that renewables already made up one third of the electricity we produced in 2023 
shows just how committed RWE is to sustainable power."
"This was the first time in our history 
that we generated more power from renewables than from coal."
"In fact, lignite-fired 
generation dropped significantly, along with carbon emissions, which even recorded a 27 % 
reduction – in one single year."
This underscores the progress we made.
"And by ‘we’, I mean 
our 20,000 employees who give their all each and every day to help RWE become an 
increasingly climate-friendly company and remain a reliable energy generator."
"People make 
organisations and RWE is no different."
"I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for 
everything our employees have achieved this year."
"And we will stay our course, despite the challenges."
We want to be climate neutral by 2040.
"Our ‘Growing Green’ strategy, which we introduced in 2021, guides our efforts in this arena."
"In fact, we have already made such good progress that we were able to significantly raise 
our investment targets for the current decade."
"We announced our new targets at a Capital 
Markets Day in November 2023."
"Geographically, we will continue to focus on Europe and the USA 
as well as selected countries in the Pacific region, such as Japan, where we recently entered 
the market thanks to a winning bid for an offshore wind project that we will be realising with 
Japanese partners."
But ‘Growing Green’ means so much more than simply building additional capacity.
"We also 
want to build on our earnings."
"When we first announced our strategy in late 2021, we were 
working towards adjusted EBITDA of around €5 billion by 2030."
"Now, we have set our sights 
on more than €9 billion."
The majority of the funds we earn operationally will be reinvested.
"But we also want to include you, our shareholders, in our economic success by continually 
raising our dividend – which we’re aiming to increase by 5 % to 10 % every year until 2030."
"As successful as this last year was for us, there’s no denying that the future harbours 
challenges."
"High inflation and interest rates, a weak global economy and the uncertain 
geopolitical situation continue to weigh on growth and demand for energy."
"Fuels such as 
gas and hard coal have therefore become significantly cheaper, while emissions allowance 
prices also dropped considerably."
"These developments weighed heavily on power prices, 
which has been reflected in the performance of our share since the beginning of the year."
"Despite the drop in electricity prices, we can confirm the profit forecast announced at our 
Capital Markets Day, which puts adjusted EBITDA at €5.2 billion to €5.8 billion this year – 
although we now expect the figure to be at the lower end of the range."
"Our investment programme will provide a broader foundation to safeguard our future 
earnings: the profits of most of our wind and solar farms are stable – as they are either 
secured by government-backed purchase prices or are subject to long-term agreements 
with key accounts."
Regional diversification also makes us more resilient.
"The best example 
here is our strong positioning in the USA, where electricity prices have recently proven to be 
less volatile than in our European core markets."
We need stability and planning certainty above all in terms of regulation.
"2024 could prove 
to be a year of political repositioning due to the upcoming European parliament elections, 
the general election in the UK and the US presidential and congress elections."
"No matter the 
outcome of these political contests, one thing remains certain."
"Climate protection cannot 
be reduced to a single item on the political agenda – it is a challenge of intergenerational 
magnitude."
"All political factions agree that we need to create a climate-neutral energy 
supply and economy."
"To this end, we need a reliable long-term regulatory framework."
"Only 
then can we invest billions in clean technologies and create thousands of jobs along the way."
"At the turn of the decade, our company set out to epitomise the change we wanted to see in 
the industry by becoming a more sustainable and climate-friendly energy business."
"This 
journey is not only a marathon, it is also associated with certain challenges."
"Here at RWE, we 
look forward to taking them on – powered by the experience, expertise and motivation of 
our entire team."
"This is why I remain confident that RWE will stay its course – and that the 
performance of our share, which has a strong long-term track record, will continue to reflect 
our success."
"Upon joining the RWE Group in 2012, he initially sat on 
the Board of Directors of RWE Supply & Trading GmbH."
"From 2015 to 2017, he then steered 
this company as CEO."
"Prior to moving to RWE, Markus Krebber held various management 
positions at Commerzbank."
"Between 2000 and 2005 he was a business consultant at 
McKinsey & Company."
Markus Krebber was born in 1973 in Kleve.
"He initially trained as a 
banker before studying economics."
"He completed his doctorate at the Humboldt University of 
Berlin in 2007."
"Michael Müller has been a member of the RWE AG Executive Board since November 2020 and 
was named Chief Financial Officer in May 2021."
"He has worked for the Group since 2005 and 
has held various management positions including Head of Group Controlling at RWE Power AG, 
RWE Generation SE and RWE AG."
"In 2016, Michael Müller became a member of the 
Management Board and Chief Financial Officer of RWE Supply & Trading GmbH."
"He worked in 
business consultancy for McKinsey & Company in the five years before joining the RWE Group."
Michael Müller was born in 1971 in Cologne.
"He first studied business and mechanical 
engineering before graduating with a doctorate in mechanical engineering."
Katja von Doren has been a member of the RWE Executive Board since August 2023.
"Prior to 
being appointed as Chief Human Resources Officer and Labour Director, she held the position 
of Chief Financial Officer of RWE Generation SE from 2018."
"Katja van Doren started working 
for RWE in 1999 and has held management roles in the areas of finance, accounting and tax."
"In 2014, she took on the role of Group Division Manager Accounting & Tax, working on the stock 
market flotation of RWE’s former subsidiary innogy SE."
"Katja van Doren was born in Hilden in 
1966."
"After graduating with a degree in business administration, she started her career in 
1991 at KPMG, where she worked as an auditor and tax consultant."
"So far, 
despite all hope, peace has not returned."
"Quite to the contrary, with the Israel Gaza war we 
are seeing another terrible conflict unfold."
"Despite this global turmoil, energy markets 
normalised after the turbulent times in 2022."
"This also holds true for companies like RWE, 
which back in 2022 put in a huge effort to help avert a gas and power supply crisis."
"And 
there has barely been time to catch one’s breath ever since."
"RWE is charting an ambitious 
course for growth and seeks to accomplish a great deal in the current decade."
"I am, of 
course, referring to our ‘Growing Green’ investment programme."
"By building renewable 
plants, battery storage systems, hydrogen-capable gas-fired power stations and 
electrolysers, RWE will play a pivotal role in fostering a sustainable and environmentally 
friendly energy supply."
The programme was launched back in 2021.
"And after only two 
years, management already raised its ambitious targets, which it announced at a Capital 
Markets Day in November 2023."
"It now aims to almost double RWE’s green generation 
capacities to over 65 GW by 2030."
"Adjusted EBITDA is expected to exceed €9 billion, 
surpassing the previous target which was set at €5 billion."
"The company wants to grow and 
be profitable."
"It has already proven that it is capable of doing just that – not least in light of 
the high operating result for the past financial year, to which new solar and wind farms 
made a notable contribution."
"I would like to single out the acquisition of Con Edison Clean 
Energy Businesses, which was completed as of 1 March 2023 and turned RWE into one of 
the largest green electricity producers in the USA."
"We fully support the Executive Board’s 
roadmap and have repeatedly passed the necessary resolutions – with 2023 proving to be 
no exception, as illustrated in the following."
Supervisory Board activity in the past year.
"As you have come to expect from us, we 
conscientiously fulfilled our duties in the fiscal year that just ended."
"The main function of the 
Supervisory Board is to advise the Executive Board on running the company and monitor its 
actions, which we did with great care."
We were involved in all fundamental decision-making.
"Management informed us verbally and in writing of all material developments pertaining to 
the Group’s business performance, financial position, net worth, strategy as well as risks and 
management thereof."
"These updates were regular, comprehensive and timely."
"We passed all 
the necessary resolutions as required by German law and the Articles of Incorporation 
based on detailed reports and draft resolutions provided by the Executive Board."
"Some 
decisions were taken by circular."
"The Executive Board kept us abreast of projects and 
processes of particular importance or urgency e."
"during extraordinary meetings and 
outside our sessions."
"The Chair of the Audit Committee – 
initially Erhard Schipporeit who was succeeded by Monika Kircher in mid-March – also 
collaborated closely with the Chief Financial Officer."
"In 2023, I again conversed with investors and proxy advisors ahead of the Annual General 
Meeting in my role as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board."
"We touched on matters such 
as the Supervisory Board’s involvement in discussions relating to RWE’s strategic alignment."
"The Audit Committee’s activities as well as RWE’s financial and sustainability reporting, 
which the Audit Committee oversees, were also debated."
"Other topics of conversation 
included the agenda and the online format of the 2023 Annual General Meeting and the 
expedited lignite phaseout in the Rhenish region."
"Furthermore, we considered the 
succession planning for the Supervisory Board at length."
"As I will go on to explain in detail, 
we are expecting a number of new appointments to the Board in 2024."
"The topic therefore 
also played an important part in my conversations with investors this year."
Main points of debate of the Supervisory Board meetings.
"Last year, the Supervisory 
Board convened for nine meetings, including five ordinary and four extraordinary sessions."
"At times, it met without the Executive Board, particularly to discuss matters that concerned 
Executive Board members."
"The shareholder and employee representatives met separately 
before the Supervisory Board meetings, in order to consult on matters in a smaller circle and 
establish joint positions where necessary."
"Our sessions mainly focused on developments on 
commodity markets as well as geopolitical crises and their potential impact on European 
energy supply."
"We also held discussions on the growth strategy and current investment 
projects."
"I will now elaborate on the main points of each meeting:
•	 Our first meeting last year took place on 27 February."
"This was an extraordinary meeting 
on the Executive Board’s planned acquisition of British project developer JBM Solar."
"•	 In our meeting on 15 March, we discussed RWE AG’s 2022 financial statements, the 
combined review of operations, the proposal for profit distribution, the combined  
non-financial statement, the Supervisory Board report and the Remuneration Report."
The independent auditors were present during the session.
"We approved the financial 
statements and endorsed the Supervisory Board report and Remuneration Report."
"We 
also approved the Agenda for RWE’s Annual General Meeting, which was held on 4 May 
2023."
"Following the advice of the Audit Committee, we decided to enlist the services of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC) for the audit of 
the financial statements for fiscal 2023."
•	 Our second ordinary session took place on 4 May.
"It served as preparation for the Annual 
General Meeting, which was held online that same day."
"•	 On 20 June, we met for an ordinary session in Maidstone to the south-east of London, 
where we concerned ourselves with financing matters and RWE’s planned growth 
investments as well as our regular review of the CEO’s remuneration."
"After the meeting,  
we visited the London Array North Sea wind farm in the North Sea and were given a 
comprehensive update on the offshore wind business."
"•	 At an extraordinary session on 11 August we discussed the impending sale of the Czech 
gas storage business to local grid operator ČEPS."
"•	 Our next ordinary session took place on 12 September, when the Executive Board 
informed us of the results of German offshore wind site auctions."
"It also presented its 
schedule of responsibilities, which had been amended since Katja van Doren had joined 
the Board."
"Following the advice of the Audit Committee, we decided to enlist the services 
of PwC for the audit of the combined non-financial statement and the Remuneration 
Report for fiscal 2023."

•	 On 20 November, we convened for an extraordinary session."
"The conversation largely 
centred on plans for a collaboration with Abu Dhabi-based company Masdar on two 
offshore wind power projects planned for the southern section of Dogger Bank in the 
British North Sea."
"We endorsed the proposal and, shortly thereafter, Masdar acquired  
a 49 % share of the project."
"•	 At an ordinary session on 12 December, we reviewed and approved the business plan for 
fiscal 2024, the outlook on fiscal 2025 and 2026 as well as the risk report."
The documents are available at www.rwe.com/corporate-governance-declaration.
"Furthermore, we discussed RWE’s sustainability strategy in great detail, paying particular 
attention to the company’s ambitious emission reduction plans."
"We are confident that 
RWE rightly claims to be acting in accordance with the 1.5-degree target of the Paris 
climate protection agreement."
"The meeting agenda also touched on German energy 
policy."
"We dealt with the necessary regulatory requirements for the urgent new 
construction of hydrogen-capable gas-fired power plants and advised on various other 
matters of strategic importance to RWE."
"We also determined the Executive Board 
remuneration targets for 2024."
"•	 Just a few days later, on 21 December, we met for another extraordinary session, 
occasioned by the planned purchase of three British offshore wind power projects from 
Swedish energy group Vattenfall."
"The three initiatives Norfolk Vanguard West, Norfolk 
Vanguard East and Norfolk Boreas could create generation capacities of up to 4.2 GW."
"Soon after we approved the move, RWE and Vattenfall agreed on the transaction which  
is expected to be completed in spring 2024."
Work of the Supervisory Board committees.
"The Supervisory Board has six committees, 
the members of which are listed on page 298 of this Annual Report."
"The committees are 
charged with preparing topics discussed by the Supervisory Board in order to establish a 
basis for the corporate body to pass resolutions."
"In certain cases, they themselves exercise 
decision-making powers if they have been conferred on them by the Supervisory Board."
"You 
can find more information on the work and composition of the committees in the Corporate 
Governance Declaration and the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board."
"These 
documents are available at www.rwe.com/corporate-governance-declaration and  
www.rwe.com/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/articles-of-association."
"The 
Supervisory Board is informed of the work of the committees by their chairs at every 
ordinary meeting."
"In the year under review, a total of 17 committee meetings were held,  
on which I would like to report in more detail."
•	 The Executive Committee held one ordinary meeting.
"As usual, it dedicated itself to the 
company’s planning for fiscal 2024 together with the outlook on the two subsequent 
years and recommended both be approved."
"•	 The Audit Committee met five times, including one extraordinary session."
"PwC, the 
auditor, was present during four meetings and was in contact with the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee outside the sessions."
"Experts from the Group were invited to the 
meetings as needed."
"Deloitte, which has been tasked with auditing the Annual Report as 
of 2024, took part in two sessions for the purposes of onboarding."
"When appropriate, the 
Committee liaised without input from the Executive Board or the auditor."
"It carefully 
reviewed the financial statements of RWE AG and the Group, the combined review of 
operations, the report on the first half of the year, the quarterly statements, and the 
combined non-financial statement."
"It discussed the financial statements with the 
Executive Board before they were published and received reports on the outcome of  
the audits and audit-like reviews from the independent auditors."
"It also verified the independence of the auditors along with the 
quality of the audit."
"The Committee also concerned itself with the appointment of an 
external auditor for the 2023 Remuneration Report and the 2023 combined non-
financial statement."
"At its meetings, it dealt with a number of other topics, such as RWE’s 
risk situation, liquidity management, protecting IT systems against cyber-attacks, making 
arrangements for the internal audit and subsequent findings, and legal and fiscal issues."
"The Audit Committee also verified the efficacy of the accounting-related internal control 
system (ICS), the compliance management system, the risk management system and the 
internal audit system."
Related party transactions were also on the agenda.
"Transactions 
were analysed to assess whether they were carried out in the ordinary course of business 
and subject to normal market conditions, as required by the law for implementing the 
second Shareholders’ Rights Directive (ARUG II)."
•	 The Personnel Affairs Committee held four ordinary meetings.
"Executive Board 
remuneration matters and long-term succession planning for the Executive Board were 
key items on the agenda."
"The Committee chose candidates 
based on the expertise needing to be replaced."
"The Supervisory Board’s skills matrix, 
which determines the goals regarding the Board’s composition, was used as a reference."
"The recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code were also taken  
into account."
"At the meetings, the Committee members fed back on their discussions  
with potential successor candidates."
"After careful consideration, they made a 
recommendation on the Supervisory Board’s proposed candidates for the 2024 Annual 
General Meeting."
"•	 The Strategy and Sustainability Committee held one ordinary and two extraordinary 
meetings."
"Issues discussed included the new growth targets that management presented 
to the public in November 2023, as well as energy policy developments and their impact 
on the Group."
"Furthermore, it discussed the Executive Board’s plans to solidify RWE’s 
position in the USA, which the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses 
significantly contributed to."
"The Committee also extensively debated the sustainability 
strategy."
"It was informed by the Executive Board of the company’s new ambitious climate 
protection targets, corporate social responsibility at RWE sites and the Group-wide 
implementation of the German Whistleblower Protection Act and the Supply Chain Due 
Diligence Act."
"It also presented the sustainability agenda for 2024, a key element of which 
is the creation of a biodiversity strategy."
•	 The Mediation Committee did not convene in the 2023 reporting year.
Attendance and meeting formats.
"The table on the following page shows the attendance 
at each Supervisory Board and committee meeting."
"As the Mediation Committee did not 
convene in 2023, it has not been listed in the summary."
"The dual figures are to be 
interpreted as follows: If the table states '7 / 9', then the respective individual attended seven 
out of nine meetings."
The numbers show that absences were the absolute exception.
"The 
participation rate was 98.5 %."
"The table on page 14 shows the individual format of each Supervisory Board and 
committee meeting."
"Ordinary meetings were generally attended in person, although at 
times some participants dialled into the sessions via a video feed."
"Most extraordinary 
meetings were held as purely virtual events."

Parent company and consolidated financial statements for 2023."
"The 2023 financial 
statements of RWE AG, the financial statements of the Group, as well as the combined 
review of operations for RWE AG and the Group have been audited and issued an 
unqualified auditor’s opinion by PwC in consideration of the accounts."
"Markus Dittmann  
and Aissata Touré were responsible for the audit."
"In addition, PwC subjected the combined 
non-financial statement in the combined review of operations to a limited assurance audit."
"Reasonable assurance checks were even carried out on individual indicators and 
information pertaining to EU taxonomy."
"It found that the Executive Board had established 
an appropriate early risk detection system."
"PwC had been elected as the independent 
auditor by the 2023 Annual General Meeting."
"Thereafter, the Supervisory Board had 
commissioned them to audit the aforementioned financial statements and reports."
"The Executive Board commented on the documents supporting the parent company 
financial statements, the Annual Report and the audit reports at the Supervisory Board’s 
balance-sheet meeting on 13 March 2024."
"The documents were made available to the 
members of the Supervisory Board in good time."
"During the session, the independent 
auditors reported on the material findings of the audit and were available to furnish 
supplementary information."
"The Audit Committee had concerned itself in depth with the 
financial statements of RWE AG, the consolidated financial statements and the audit 
reports with the auditors present the day before."
"The Committee recommended that the 
Supervisory Board approve the financial statements and endorse the appropriation of 
distributable profit proposed by the Executive Board."
"The financial statements of RWE AG, the consolidated financial statements, the combined 
review of operations, the Executive Board’s proposal regarding the appropriation of 
distributable profit, and the combined non-financial statement were reviewed by the 
Supervisory Board."
We did not raise any objections as a result of this review.
"As 
recommended by the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board endorsed the findings of the 
audits of the financial statements of RWE AG and the consolidated financial statements 
and approved both financial statements."
"The 2023 annual financial statements are 
therefore adopted."
"The Supervisory Board concurs with the Executive Board’s proposal 
regarding the appropriation of profits, which envisages paying a dividend of €1.00 per 
share."
Training programme for Supervisory Board members.
"One of our duties as members of 
the Supervisory Board is to take responsibility for the training and professional development 
necessary for our work."
"We do so, and are supported by RWE AG in these efforts, e."
"by 
organising information forums."
"As mentioned above, we visited the British offshore wind 
farm London Array in June 2023 within the context of such an event."
"On site, the company 
gave us a comprehensive overview of the economic, technical and environmental 
considerations of offshore wind power and updated us as to its current construction 
projects."
"At another information forum in September 2023, we gained insights into 
technology scouting at RWE, i."
"the ways in which new technologies are analysed and 
evaluated."
Managing opportunities and risks was also explained in detail.
"RWE bears the 
cost of this training."
"As explained on  
page 39, Katja van Doren took office as a member of the Executive Board and Labour 
Director of RWE AG on 1 August 2023."
"She succeeds Zvezdana Seeger, who left the 
Executive Board for personal reasons at the end of July 2023."
"The Supervisory Board also 
saw a change in personnel: after seven dedicated years in office, Erhard Schipporeit  
passed the baton of Chair of the Audit Committee to Monika Kircher in the middle of March."
"On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank Zvezdana Seeger and Erhard 
Schipporeit for their hard work and commitment to our company."
"Having delved into the work of the Supervisory Board, I would 
now like to turn to RWE’s employees."
"It is thanks to their dedication that our company can 
once again look back on a successful financial year."
"And I am by no means only referring to 
the excellent operating result."
"What has impressed me more than anything is how the  
Group has managed to expedite its growth trajectory, despite the challenging environment."
This will pay off both in economic and ecological terms.
"To the Executive Board and all 
employees, that give their all to keeping RWE on track, despite the recent headwinds,  
I extend my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Supervisory Board."
"Germany’s leading index, the DAX, gained 20 % as fears of  
a gas supply crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine dissipated."
"Towards the end of the 
year, markets were buoyed by hopes of looser monetary policies."
"The RWE share 
performed below average, in part due to a drop in wholesale electricity prices."
"Our 
investors also became unsettled as some of our competitors’ renewables projects came 
under pressure from rising costs."
"At the end of November, we announced our revised 
growth targets to the public, giving our investors renewed confidence in the value of 
our green investments."
An unexpectedly strong year for the markets in 2023: DAX up 20 %.
"After a weak 2022, 
impacted by interest rises and the war in Ukraine, the surprising stock market rally in 2023 
caught many off guard."
"On 14 December, the DAX exceeded 17,000 points for the first time 
ever."
"It closed the year at 16,752, which corresponds to a total annual return of 20 %."
"The 
surge was largely triggered by cyclical and tech shares, which had plummeted in 2022."
"Sentiments were further buoyed as the feared gas supply crisis anticipated for winter 
2022 / 2023 failed to materialise, and energy prices fell significantly following record highs 
the year prior."
"Although markets were briefly rattled by the escalation of the conflict in the 
Middle East, the new-found sense of optimism soon returned."
"Hopes of a peak in interest 
rates and looser monetary policies in 2024 spurred markets to end the year with one final 
push."
RWE share records below average performance of 1 %.
"The RWE share could not keep up 
with the DAX, closing the year at €41.18 – not far off its 2022 closing price of €41.59."
"Including the dividend of €0.90 paid in May, our share was up 1 % over the year, which was 
significantly below the STOXX Europe 600 Utilities (+ 14 %)."
"This disappointing stock market 
performance was in part attributable to the fact that prices on electricity wholesale markets 
have dropped."
"Financial analysts and investors therefore revised their forecasts for our 
future generation margins downward."
"In addition, a number of our competitors’ wind power 
projects came under pressure from rising interest rates and the increased cost of materials."
This gave our shareholders cause for concern.
"In late November, we announced our new 
ambitious growth targets for our green core business at our Capital Markets Day."
"In doing 
so, we strengthened our investors’ trust in the value of our renewables projects, which was 
reflected in a positive response from the stock market."
"In view of the Group’s good 
earnings, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of RWE AG will propose a dividend 
of €1.00 per share for fiscal 2023 to the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2024."
"Thereafter, we will look to raise the dividend 5 % to 10 % annually."
"The Executive Board 
envisages that the dividend payment for 2024 will likely be €1.10 per share, which 
represents an increase of 10 %."
Broad international shareholder base.
"Based on our latest survey, at the end of last year, 
an estimated 88 % of the total of 743.8 million RWE shares were held by institutional 
investors, with 12 % owned by individuals (including employees)."
"At the last count, 
institutional investors from Germany owned 21 % of our capital stock."
"This investor group 
accounted for 13 % in the rest of Continental Europe, 15 % in the United Kingdom / Ireland, 
24 % in North America and 11 % in the Middle East."
"At the end of 2023, our single-largest 
shareholder was Qatar Holding, with a stake of 9.1 %, followed by US asset management 
company BlackRock with 6.3 %."
1	 The comparability of some of the figures for various fiscal years is limited due to changes in reporting.
"2	 Dividend proposal for RWE AG’s 2023 fiscal year, subject to the passing of a resolution by the 3 May 2024 Annual General Meeting."
3	 Ratio of the dividend per share to the share price at the end of the respective fiscal year.
4	 The new shares from the conversion of the mandatory convertible bond issued to Qatar Holding on 10 October 2022 have been prorated.
"About 1 % of our stock is owned by our 
current and former staff members."
"In Germany and the UK, we offer our employees the 
opportunity to take shares in RWE on preferential terms."
"Last year, 7,684 people, 
representing 46 % of all qualifying staff members, made use of these offers and bought a 
total of 463,000 shares."
"The preferential terms and the administration of the employee 
share schemes led to an expense of €4.9 million."
RWE represented on numerous stock markets.
"RWE shares are traded on the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange and other stock exchanges in Germany, as well as via electronic platforms 
such as Xetra."
They are also available on stock markets in the rest of Europe.
"In the USA, 
RWE is represented via a Level 1 ADR programme, under which American Depositary 
Receipts – or ADRs for short – are traded in place of our shares."
"ADRs are share certificates 
issued by US depositary banks, representing a certain number of a foreign company’s 
deposited shares."
"Under RWE’s programme, one ADR represents one share."
New placements trigger RWE bond volume rise to €7.2 billion.
"At the end of February 
2024, RWE bonds with a nominal value of around €7.2 billion were outstanding."
"This is 
€1.5 billion more than at the end of 2022."
"To improve our financial headroom for growth 
investments, we issued three new bonds – two in February 2023 followed by another in 
January 2024."
All three are green bonds with a volume of €500 million each.
"The two 
papers issued in February have tenors of 6 years and 12 years and coupons of 3.625 % and 
4.125 %, respectively."
"The debt security issued in January 2024 will mature after eight years 
and has a coupon of 3.625 %."

"The level of our borrowing costs largely depends on 
how independent rating agencies assess of our creditworthiness."
"Moody’s and Fitch make 
such evaluations at our request."
They both assign an investment grade credit rating to us.
"Moody’s gives our long-term creditworthiness a rating of ‘Baa2’, and Fitch has graded us 
one rating higher at ‘BBB+’."
The outlook on our rating is ‘stable’ for both agencies.
"They 
reconfirmed their assessment of RWE’s creditworthiness recently, Moody’s in October 2023 
and Fitch in February 2024."

First call date: 30 March 2026."
"By building and operating renewable assets, battery storage facilities, 
hydrogen-ready gas assets and electrolysers, we are helping to deliver an energy 
system that lives up to society’s high expectations."
"We announced our strategy in 
November 2021, and now two years later, we have already been able to significantly 
raise our growth targets."
"Between 2024 and 2030, we plan to invest €55 billion net  
and expand our generation capacity to over 65 GW."
"This will not only help us become 
greener, but also more profitable: we’re aiming for adjusted EBITDA of more than 
€9 billion in 2030."
This would be almost double our previous target.
Who we are and what we do.
"RWE is a leading international energy company 
headquartered in Essen, Germany, with a focus on electricity generation."
"Renewable energy 
sources such as wind and solar and climate-friendly power stations are an increasingly 
important part of our business."
"Our core activities also include gas and electricity storage, 
energy trading, the hydrogen business and innovative energy solutions for industrial 
customers."
"We generated ­
revenues of €28.6 billion in fiscal 2023."
"Our key markets are 
Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the USA."
"In the field of renewables, our 
activities stretch far beyond these countries to include numerous European states such as 
Poland, Spain, Italy, France, ­
Denmark and Greece as well as markets in the Pacific region 
such as Australia and Japan."
"Balancing climate protection, security and affordability."
"All countries where we do 
business have made their energy policies contingent on ambitious climate protection 
targets."
"They want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels to net zero 
over the long term."
"Another key focus is ensuring their energy supply remains both reliable 
and affordable."
RWE wants to be a major player in the push to make this possible.
"We believe 
we can best support in the following areas:
•	 Decarbonising electricity generation."
"A core component of the energy transition is 
moving away from electricity generation using fossil fuels and embracing renewables."
"Coal and natural gas are finite resources, which when combusted lead to the emission of 
greenhouse gases."
"Wind, sun and water, on the other hand, are available in abundance, 
and do not emit carbon when harnessed."
"Another advantage is that these energy sources 
can also help our European markets become independent of fuel imports and limit the 
impact of commodity prices on the cost of electricity, heat and transportation."
•	 Providing storage and climate-friendly backup plants.
"As energy supplies rely 
increasingly on wind and solar farms, energy storage systems are becoming ever more 
important for stabilising the power grids."
"In addition, we require environmentally friendly, 
flexible generation assets, which can reliably produce electricity when there is no wind and 
no sunshine."
"Modern gas-fired power stations are well-placed to address this need if they 
are retrofitted to run on carbon-neutral fuels such as hydrogen (H2)."
"During combustion, 
this gas does not emit greenhouse gases and producing H2 can also be carbon-free e."
"if 
it is made by electrolysis using renewable energy (green hydrogen)."

•	 Electrification."
"Action also needs to be taken in the manufacturing, heat and 
transportation sectors."
"At present, oil, coal and gas cover around 70 % of energy 
consumption in the EU."
"Switching from fossil fuels to electricity produced using carbon-
neutral methods would also enable cross-sector CO2 emissions to be reduced."
Electrification is therefore indispensable to achieving climate goals.
"To cover the 
additional electricity needed, green generation capacities must be rapidly expanded."
•	 Ramping up the hydrogen economy.
"The economy can only be completely decarbonised 
if solutions are also found for applications which are not suitable for direct electrification."
"This includes the production of steel and fertilisers, for example."
"In these scenarios, 
hydrogen produced using climate-neutral methods would be a viable solution."
"The 
importance of H2 therefore extends far beyond its use within power generation – all the 
more reason to ramp up the hydrogen economy to facilitate the energy transition."
The driving force behind the energy transition.
"RWE is playing its part in transforming the 
energy sector and the broader economy in all of the areas discussed above."
"We do this by 
investing billions of euros in wind power, photovoltaics, battery storage and the hydrogen 
economy, phasing out coal-based generation, building sustainable backup capacities and 
helping industrial customers to optimise energy consumption."
"In parallel, we are working 
with policymakers to ensure security of supply."
"For instance, we are organising imports of 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Germany and helping to develop the necessary LNG 
infrastructure."
"We are aiming to be carbon neutral by 2040 at the latest, ten years earlier 
than the EU."
"Not only does this apply to our own greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1), it also 
covers the upstream and downstream value chain (Scope 2 and 3)."
"By 2030, we want to 
have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 68 % and our Scope 3 emissions by 
42 % compared to 2022."
"At the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, the international 
community set its sights on limiting the increase in average global temperatures to ideally 
no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels."
"Our targets are in line 
with this commitment."
"When this report was published, the independent Science Based 
Targets initiative was yet to confirm this assessment."
Sustainability – at the heart of our corporate culture.
"Our mission statement ‘Our energy 
for a sustainable life’ expresses our purpose as a company and reaffirms our commitment 
to sustainability as a guiding principle of our actions."
"But although cutting greenhouse gas 
emissions is important to us, it is by no means our only priority."
"Sustainability is measured in 
a myriad of ways."
"The expression is generally used within the context of environment, social 
and governance (ESG)."
"Working together with internal and external experts, we defined 
which ESG issues pose the greatest challenges to RWE and determined how we want to 
address them."
"You can find more information on our ESG goals and to what extent we have 
met these targets on page 75 et seqq."
Growing Green – our strategic road map to 2030.
"In 2021, we developed our Growing 
Green strategy and presented it to the public."
"As the name suggests, it is centred on working 
towards profitable growth in our green core business."
"Our initial goal for the period between 
2021 and 2030 was to invest approximately €30 billion net – i."
"after deducting cash flows 
from divestments – in new wind farms, solar assets, battery storage facilities, hydrogen-
capable gas-fired power plants and electrolysers."
"The aim was to double the installed 
capacity in our core business to 50 GW."
"This figure has been prorated, meaning it reflects 
capacity based on our shareholding ratios."
"Our progress in delivering our Growing Green 
strategy has been faster than expected: in the first three years alone (2021 to 2023) our 
net investments totalled €17.9 billion and we were able to add 9.9 GW of installed capacity 
to our portfolio."
"We have since significantly raised our targets, which we announced at our 
Capital Markets Day in November 2023."
"In the seven years between 2024 and 2030, we 
are planning around €55 billion in net investments, which are mostly earmarked for Europe 
and the USA."
"This will allow us to increase our current green installed capacity by 35.5 GW 
(pro rata – as at the end of 2023) to over 65 GW by 2030."
"To this end, we have access to a 
project pipeline which has the potential to deliver projects totalling more than 100 GW."
"We 
want to increase adjusted EBITDA in our core business to over €9 billion by 2030."
"By 
comparison, when we first launched the Growing Green programme back in 2021, our 
original target was to have an EBITDA of around €5 billion by 2030."

Turning to the individual components of our growth programme:
•	 Offshore Wind."
"At the end of 2023, our offshore wind portfolio had a total installed 
capacity of approximately 3.3 GW (pro rata)."
"Another 2.5 GW was under construction, 
namely our two wind farms in the North Sea: Sofia (1.4 GW) located off the east coast of 
England and Thor (1.1 GW) to the west of Denmark."
"We have set our sights on upping our 
offshore wind capacity to 6 GW by the end of 2027 and then to 10 GW by the end of 
2030."
"Geographically, these efforts will focus on North-West Europe and the USA."
"Certain 
countries in the Pacific could also prove relevant, such as Japan, where we entered the 
market in 2023: a consortium comprising RWE, Mitsui and Osaka Gas was selected to 
deliver an offshore wind farm off the west coast of the country (see page 36)."
"Land-based turbines are currently our most important renewable energy 
source."
"In late 2023, these assets contributed 8.7 GW (pro rata) to our generation 
capacity."
"We are in the process of building wind turbines totalling 1.2 GW, and plan to 
expand our onshore wind portfolio to 12 GW by 2027 and again to 14 GW by 2030."
"The 
new assets are expected to be largely sited in North America and Europe."
"We are also 
planning a number of projects in Australia."
"In our solar segment, we took a big step forward in 2023 with our acquisition of 
Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses."
"At the end of the year, we operated 4.2 GW of 
photovoltaic assets (pro rata), 3.3 GW of which stemmed from the aforementioned 
takeover."
A further 3.1 GW were under construction.
"Our growth target for solar power is 
ambitious: we want to increase our portfolio to 12 GW by 2027 and to 16 GW by 2030."
"We are looking to deliver these projects in North America, Europe and Australia."
"The increased dependence on more volatile energy sources such as 
wind and solar calls for more battery storage systems."
"RWE has been looking into 
developing, constructing and operating large-scale batteries for many years now."
"Our 
operational battery storage capacity in late 2023 amounted to 0.7 GW (pro rata) with 
assets totalling 1.1 GW under construction."
"We are expecting to up this figure to 4 GW by 
2027 and again to 6 GW by 2030."
"During 2023, we completed a key battery project in 
Fresno County, California, taking a 137 MW battery storage facility online – our biggest to 
date."
It is connected to a 150 MW solar farm.
"This synergy allows us to optimise electricity 
feed-ins to the local grid, thereby improving the yield of the solar farm."
"We also develop 
battery storage to provide grid services."
"Examples include our two batteries at our 
German power generation sites Hamm and Neurath, boasting capacities of 140 MW  
and 80 MW respectively."
•	 Flexible gas-fired power stations.
"Coal-fired power stations continue to make a 
significant contribution to the security of supply in our domestic market Germany in 
particular."
"The planned exit from this technology cannot be covered by new renewable 
assets and battery storage solutions alone."
"Instead, we need flexible, climate-friendly 
generation capacities that can bridge fluctuations in solar and wind energy feed-ins."
Gas-fired power plants play a key role in this regard.
"At the end of 2023, our generation 
portfolio included 15.7 GW (pro rata) of gas-fired capacity."
"We see a particular need for 
investments in Germany, where we expect to have built hydrogen-capable gas-fired 
power stations with a total capacity of 3 GW by the end of the decade."
"The plants will 
largely be constructed on sites which have until now been utilised for coal-fired 
generation."
"That said, we will only make these investments if the government provides the 
necessary economic incentives."
"Furthermore, conditions must be in place for us to 
operate our gas-fired power stations using green hydrogen over the longer term."
"We are 
planning the necessary retrofits throughout Europe for existing assets and have already 
finalised the overall concepts."
"In addition to adapting stations to run on green hydrogen, 
another option would be carbon capture and storage."
"Using this method, carbon dioxide  
is separated from the flue gases and stored underground."
"We have already explored this 
option in great detail through a range of research and development initiatives."

•	 Hydrogen."
"The hydrogen economy is a crucial part of the energy transition and aligns 
seamlessly with our business model."
"We want to be active along the entire value chain, 
from green electricity generation to electrolysis-based hydrogen production, hydrogen 
trading and hydrogen storage right through to the conclusion of individual supply 
agreements with major industrial customers."
"We have set our sights on building 2 GW (pro 
rata) of electrolyser capacity by the end of 2030."
"Our regional focus for these activities is 
on Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom."
"In recent years, we have forged 
numerous partnerships with businesses and research institutes seeking to work closely 
with us to develop a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure."
"One example is the German 
GET H2 initiative, as part of which we expect to deliver 300 MW of electrolyser capacity at 
our Lingen site by 2027."
"One lighthouse project that we launched independently is 
OranjeWind in the Netherlands, where we plan to build an offshore wind farm which is 
complemented by extensive infrastructure to allow for demand-oriented feed-ins into the 
public grid."
"Electrolysers play a key part in this regard as they can be used to turn some of 
the electricity into hydrogen."
"More information on our hydrogen strategy and other major 
projects can be found at ­
www.rwe.com/hydrogen."
•	 Energy trading and customer solutions.
"Trading electricity, fuel and other energy-
related commodities form part of our core competencies."
"These activities are managed 
by RWE Supply & Trading, our interface to the international energy markets."
"The company’s 
activities extend far beyond proprietary trading."
"For example, they sell power generated  
by the Group and procure the fuel and emission allowances required to produce said 
electricity."
The objective here first and foremost is to limit price risks.
"On top of that, 
RWE Supply & Trading is in charge of the commercial optimisation of our power generation 
dispatch, with associated earnings going to the individual operating companies."
"Businesses outside of the RWE Group can also benefit from the expertise of our trading 
subsidiary through a wide range of products and services, ranging from traditional energy 
supply contracts and energy management solutions to sophisticated risk management 
concepts."
RWE Supply & Trading also oversees our business with pipeline gas and LNG.
"The company 
enters into long-term supply agreements with producers, organises gas transportation by 
booking pipelines, LNG tankers and regasification terminals as well as using storage 
facilities to time deliveries."
"True to the principle: the greater the size and diversification of 
the procurement and supply portfolios, the better the chances to commercially optimise 
them."
The gas business also opens up opportunities for hydrogen activities.
"For example, 
in Brunsbüttel (near Hamburg), we are planning to build a second terminal next to the LNG 
terminal which we are already co-developing with our partners."
"The plan here is to be able 
to import green ammonia, which could then be converted into hydrogen."
Socially acceptable phaseout of coal-fired generation.
"Our growth programme is flanked 
by an accelerated coal exit."
"Our use of hard coal is limited to our Dutch stations Amer and 
Eemshaven, where it is co-fired with biomass."
"By 2025 and 2030, respectively, we will either 
have retrofitted these plants to only run on biomass or we will have shut them down."
"Conversely, the phaseout of lignite, which we produce and use to generate electricity in the 
Rhenish region to the west of Cologne, is significantly more complex."
"We agreed with the 
German government and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to stop producing electricity 
from lignite by 2030."
"We will do our utmost to protect our employees from any resulting 
social hardship."
"Comprehensive compensatory measures will be taken for the affected 
individuals, such as a statutory adjustment allowance."
"Our responsibility to the people in the Rhenish region does not end at the gates of our 
plants: we are helping ensure that the region remains structurally resilient and integrated 
within the energy sector despite the coal phaseout, e."
"through the expansion of renewable 
energy."
"We intend to build no less than 500 MW of wind and solar capacity in the Rhenish 
region by 2030, where parts of the recultivated land are ideally suited for this purpose."
"We 
also want to repurpose our power station sites."
"A noteworthy example here is the mega 
battery that we are currently constructing in Neurath."
"Another option would be to build new, 
hydrogen-capable gas-fired power stations at the sites."
"The Niederaussem Innovation 
Centre, where we are exploring Power-to-Gas technologies among other things, also plays 
an important part in our plans."

Nuclear power – our focus is on safe and efficient dismantling."
"Germany’s last three 
nuclear power stations were shut down on 15 April 2023, including RWE’s Emsland reactor 
in Lingen."
"Aside from our 30 % stake in the Dutch nuclear power station Borssele, this also 
marked the end of RWE’s involvement in nuclear technology."
"We are now focused on 
ensuring all assets that have been shut down are safely and efficiently dismantled."
"Launching new energy-industry-related undertakings on the former nuclear power sites is 
also a key concern."
"One example of this is our gas-fired power plant in Biblis, which was 
commissioned in early 2023 and is used to stabilise grid frequency, thereby helping to 
ensure security of supply."
RWE AG’s management system.
"Our management system is geared towards sustainable 
growth that creates value and is based on RWE’s strategic guidelines."
"To develop these 
guidelines, we analyse the market environment and competitiveness of our segment 
activities, identify growth potential and weigh up the opportunities and risks involved."
"Which 
projects are ultimately realised is at the discretion of the management of the operating 
company concerned."
Larger investments are approved by the Executive Board of RWE AG.
"It also determines the allocation of capital, the long-term portfolio development and the 
type of financing."
"To operationally manage the Group’s activities, RWE deploys a groupwide planning and 
controlling system, which allows for timely, detailed insights into the current and prospective 
development of the company’s financial position, assets and earnings."
"Based on the targets 
set by the Executive Board and management’s expectations regarding the development of 
the business, once a year we deliver our medium-term and long-term plans, in which we 
forecast the development of key financial indicators."
"The medium-term plan contains the 
budget figures for the following fiscal year and planned figures for the two years thereafter."
"The Executive Board submits the plan to the Supervisory Board, which reviews and approves 
it."
"We compile an internal forecast for each fiscal year, which is updated every quarter."
"Members of the Executive Board of RWE AG and the main operating companies meet 
regularly to analyse the company’s assets, financial position and earnings and revise the 
forecast."
"In the event that the forecast figures deviate significantly from the budget figures  
during a fiscal year, we analyse the underlying reasons and take necessary 
countermeasures."
"We also immediately notify the capital market if published forecasts need 
to be modified."
"Among other things, we use key earnings indicators such as 
EBITDA, EBIT and net income to manage our business; however, we adjust these indicators 
by removing special items."
"EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortisation."
"In order to improve its explanatory power in relation to ordinary business 
development, we carry out adjustments: non-operating or non-recurring effects are 
removed and presented in the non-operating result."
"This applies to capital gains or losses, 
temporary effects from the fair valuation of derivatives, goodwill impairments, other 
relevant special items and – from 2024 onwards – total earnings from our phaseout 
technologies coal and nuclear."
"Subtracting operating depreciation and amortisation from 
adjusted EBITDA yields adjusted EBIT."
"Adjusted net income is another key operating 
indicator for us."
"We calculate it by correcting net income to exclude the non-operating 
result."
"Instead of the actual tax rate, which contains one-off effects, we apply the budgeted 
rate of 20 %, which we have derived in consideration of the (expected) taxable earnings in 
our core markets and the tax rates applicable there."
Expected minimum return on investments.
"We primarily use the internal rate of return (IRR) 
to evaluate the attractiveness of investment projects and only pursue projects if – at the 
time of the investment decision – the expected IRR stays above a defined minimum 
threshold."
"We determine this key figure using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), 
i."
the average cost of capital weighted according to debt and equity financing.
"The 
expected minimum returns are calculated by taking the WACC plus project-specific risk 
premiums, which usually range from 100 to 300 basis points, depending on the technology 
or region."
"Using this approach, we derived minimum IRR thresholds that vary between 7 % 
and 11 % for offshore wind."
"We require rates no lower than 6 % to 10 % for our onshore wind, 
solar and battery projects."
"The thresholds for new gas-fired power stations and hydrogen 
activities are between 8 % and 12 %."

Safeguarding our financial strength and creditworthiness."
"The RWE Group’s financial 
position is analysed using cash flows from operating activities, amongst other things."
"We 
also attach special importance to the development of free cash flow, which is derived by 
deducting capital expenditure from cash flows from operating activities and adding 
proceeds from divestments and asset disposals."
"We also determine adjusted cash flow for 
the technologies which we are phasing out (lignite and nuclear), which serves as a key 
performance indicator for these activities."
"Net cash / net debt is another indicator of RWE’s 
financial strength."
"It is calculated by deducting provisions for pensions and similar 
obligations for the dismantling of renewable assets and for nuclear waste management 
from RWE’s net financial position."
"Conversely, mining provisions and financial assets that we 
assign to these obligations are disregarded."
"The latter includes our 15 % stake in E.ON and 
our claim for compensation for the German lignite phaseout less the payments already 
made by the state."
"In managing our indebtedness, we orientate ourselves towards the leverage factor, i."
"the 
ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA in our core business."
"As of 31 December 2023, the 
leverage factor was 0.9."
"In future, we expect net debt to increase, as we will partially finance 
our growth investments by raising debt capital."
"However, for the time being we have set our 
leverage factor cap at 3.0."
"The aim here is to stay financially flexible whilst maintaining our 
solid investment grade rating."
"For the period after 2025 we believe that an upper limit of 
3.5 is acceptable, as the expansion of renewables will further enhance our financial stability."
The transformation of the energy sector presents us with many such questions.
"And  
we want to provide answers."
"Last year, RWE and partners from industry and science 
launched and drove forward around 200 innovation projects."
"Most of the ventures  
had the same mission: to develop solutions to the technical challenges of the  
energy transition."
Solutions for a sustainable energy system.
"Our contribution to the energy transition is not 
simply defined by the volume of our investments, but also by how innovative we are."
"RWE is 
constantly seeking new ways to make the energy transition more efficient and cost-
effective."
"We initiate research projects, provide the necessary funding, infrastructure and 
expertise and are often the first to put novel ideas into practice."
"Our activities in this area 
focus on developing solutions that help us advance the utilisation of renewable energy, 
expand energy storage and drive the ramp-up of large-scale hydrogen production."
"Our 
1,366 patents and patent filings based on 226 inventions (as of the end of 2023) 
demonstrate how active we are when it comes to research and development (R & D)."
"Last 
year, we drove forward around 200 R & D projects, with around 350 RWE employees 
working full or part time on these endeavours."
"In so doing, we often work with other 
companies or research institutions, which allows us to benefit from their valuable insights."
"This approach is also financially advantageous, as the costs are then shouldered by many 
stakeholders."
"Last year, our R & D spending therefore amounted to a moderate €17 million 
(previous year: €20 million)."
"On the following pages, we present a small selection of our current innovation projects."
"They 
illustrate the breadth and depth of the challenges we face in light of the energy transition 
and demonstrate the creativity with which we are tackling them."
The wake effect: a challenge for wind farm planning.
"Whenever we plan new wind farms, 
we calculate a whole host of parameters that affect both output and yield."
"One of these 
factors is the wake effect."
"This is the phenomenon caused by wind slowing and swirling once 
it hits a turbine."
"Wind turbines located in the ‘shadow’ of the first wind turbine experience a 
reduced yield."
"The effect must therefore be factored into planning offshore wind farms so it 
can be minimised."
"To date, we have calculated it using conventional computer models with 
which we are able to map a large number of scenarios in a short period of time."
"However, 
increasingly densely positioned wind farms, a development anticipated in the North Sea for 
instance, call for highly precise calculations, meaning that our models will need to be refined."
RWE initiates and supports research ventures that will help us make progress in this area.
"One example is our contribution to the X-Wakes project supported by the German Ministry 
for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK)."
"We provided the researchers with 
extensive data from our wind farms and enabled them to carry out wind measurements 
using sensors mounted to buoys in the vicinity of our wind turbines."
"This project was 
completed in 2023 and will allow for changes in wind conditions resulting from the planned 
large-scale expansion of wind farms in the North Sea to be predicted with greater accuracy."
"A second undertaking, named OWA-GloBE, which we carried out with partners from the 
wind industry and which was also concluded in 2023, related to a phenomenon known as 
the ‘blockage effect’."
"This describes a drop in wind speed just before the wind hits the 
turbine, which has an impact on the wind farm’s yield."
"Only if the global blockage effect is 
calculated accurately can the wake effect be simulated precisely."
"Data obtained through 
OWA-GloBE is now being used to optimise computer models deployed throughout the 
industry."
"Last year, we initiated a further project called ‘C2-Wakes’, which we are planning to 
deliver together with research partners at three adjacent RWE offshore wind sites in the 
North Sea."
"This project – which is also supported by the BMWK – will also help us to gain a 
better understanding of the effects of offshore wind generation on wind patterns."

Floating wind turbine in the Bay of Biscay starts operating."
"Almost all offshore wind 
turbines have one thing in common: they are built on the seabed."
"This is why they can 
currently only be constructed in shallow waters."
"But the tide is turning – thanks to the 
development of floating turbines, which are mounted on buoyant platforms made of steel or 
concrete and secured to the seabed using mooring systems."
"These units unlock the 
possibility of generating power in deeper, hitherto uncharted waters."
"RWE has taken a 
leading role in developing this new potential."
"Before the DemoSATH turbine 
was commissioned, the catamaran-like buoyant structure was launched in the Port of 
Bilbao and towed to its final location in the Bay of Biscay."
"Now we would like to find out how it 
copes with the Bay’s rough weather conditions and analyse its impact on marine life."
Ocean sites – a promising option for solar farms.
"Our goal of tapping into new areas  
to produce renewable energy is not restricted to wind power."
"In the middle of 2022, we 
commissioned our first floating solar farm on a lake in the Netherlands."
"Now we want to 
demonstrate that solar power can be produced under challenging conditions at sea."
"Besides opening up new areas, we can create synergies through joint operations with 
offshore wind farms."
"RWE has teamed up with technology partners to conduct pilot projects 
involving offshore photovoltaics."
"For example, we are participating in the EU-SCORES 
research project supported by the European Union."
"This undertaking consists of testing a 
2.6 MW offshore PV system produced by Oceans of Energy."
"The solar panels form a carpet 
over the water."
"Although forgoing a substructure offers cost advantages, the solar cells are 
exposed to higher strain as they are in direct contact with seawater."
"A more expensive 
alternative which offers the advantage of putting less stress on the modules is being tested 
within the scope of the Merganser project, a collaboration between RWE and Dutch-
Norwegian startup SolarDuck."
"Our partner is building a 0.5 MW pilot plant off the Dutch 
coast, consisting of solar panels installed on floating platforms several metres above the 
surface of the sea."
"This keeps them drier and cleaner, which is expected to reduce maintenance costs and 
increase service life."
"We hope that these pilot projects provide us with valuable insights 
which help us to commercialise offshore photovoltaics."
Photovoltaics and agriculture – from competing for space to synergy.
"Competition for 
available land is often a challenge when expanding renewable energy, above all in densely 
populated regions."
"Wind turbines in the vicinity of residential areas are good examples of 
this."
"Ground-mounted solar PV systems take up a lot of space which could be used in other 
ways, e."
"We are seeking to answer these questions by launching a demonstration 
project backed by the Julich Research Centre and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy 
Systems."
"In late 2023, we commissioned an agri-PV system with an output of 3.2 MW on 
seven hectares at the Garzweiler opencast mine."
"Its solar panels were mounted in three 
different ways, each of which enables the land to also be used for agriculture."
"The project 
aims to explore the pros and cons of the individual system designs."
"The first variant features 
perpendicular modules that allow tractors to move between them."
"The second design 
involves movable modules connected to a tracker system that automatically turns them to 
face the sun."
"This flexibility enables the modules to be temporarily positioned in a way that 
makes room for agricultural machines."
"The third setup consists of panels forming a pergola-
like structure two to three metres above the ground."
"This allows crops that thrive in the 
shade such as raspberries and blueberries to grow beneath."
"Moreover, shared land usage is 
actually beneficial to the plants as the panels protect them from excessive sunshine, wind 
and hail."
"Our demonstrator project in the Rhenish lignite-mining region is supported by the 
state of North Rhine-Westphalia via the progres.nrw programme and is expected to deliver 
initial findings in 2024."

Hydrogen – the energy source of the future."
"Hydrogen is an all-rounder when it comes to 
the energy transition."
"It can be produced climate-neutrally, for example using electrolysis 
with power from renewable sources, and it can also be re-electrified if necessary."
"This makes 
it an ideal storage medium for wind and solar power."
"Moreover, hydrogen is a sustainable 
fuel that can be used in the transportation sector or in order to decarbonise industrial 
processes that cannot run on green electricity."
"Together with partners, RWE is currently 
working on around 30 hydrogen projects centred on Germany, the Netherlands and the UK."
"The objective is to produce hydrogen on a large scale and build an expansive hydrogen 
network."
We report on our most important projects at www.rwe.com/hydrogen.
First steps towards large-scale hydrogen production.
"One of the first cross-sector 
hydrogen initiatives in Germany is GET H2, in which we work with numerous companies  
and research institutes."
"The project spans the entire hydrogen value chain, from production 
and transport to usage, with the long-term objective of building a nationwide hydrogen 
infrastructure in Germany."
"As part of the initiative, in 2020 we joined forces with partners in 
the vicinity of our Lingen power station to launch the GET H2 Nukleus project and apply for 
the necessary state subsidies."
"By 2027, three electrolysers are set to be built on the site, 
each with a capacity of 100 MW."
"We ordered the first two from Linde Engineering in early 
2023 and expect to start producing hydrogen on a large scale as early as 2025."
"A 14 MW 
pilot plant was also commissioned in early 2024 that deploys electrolysis technology from 
Linde and Sunfire in order to explore the pros and cons of various production methods."
"The 
trial is currently scheduled to last three to four years and the state of Lower Saxony will cover 
€8 million of the costs."
GET H2 TransHyDE: small-scale hydrogen economy.
"Powerful, reliable transport and 
storage infrastructure is necessary to ramp up the hydrogen economy."
"The GET H2 
TransHyDE project that we started in 2021 with a number of partners aims to determine 
the ideal design."
"The initiative seeks to analyse unanswered questions in quasi-real life 
conditions."
"For this purpose, we built a test environment including a pipeline at the Emsland  
gas-fired power station in Lingen."
"The infrastructure model comprises a 250 kW Sunfire 
electrolyser."
"We produced the very first batch of hydrogen at the Lingen site with this plant  
in September 2023."
"The reliability and stability of hydrogen infrastructure greatly depend on the materials used 
to build it."
"This is why, as part of the GET H2 TransHyDE initiative, we are looking into the 
behaviour of various materials under real-life operating conditions."
"We set up a laboratory 
at our innovation centre in Niederaussem designed to verify and assess their suitability for 
use in a pure hydrogen environment."
"We are exploring the reactions of materials to elevated 
temperatures that occur when innovative methods are used to produce hydrogen and the 
effects of changes in surface structure caused by corrosion."
"Our investigations cover both 
new components as well as parts that have already been subjected to the stresses of 
operational deployment."
"Furthermore, we are looking into improving the methods used to 
test materials."
Widespread support for the H2ercules infrastructure project.
"Another major project 
driving the development of the German hydrogen economy is H2ercules, which we launched 
in the spring of 2022 with gas network operator OGE."
"By 2030, the initiative aims to build a 
network spanning approximately 1,500 kilometres that will connect electrolysers, storage 
facilities, and import terminals in the north with industrial customers in the west and south 
of Germany."
"H2ercules is therefore contributing to the creation of the core hydrogen grid, 
which the German government plans as the basic framework for the German hydrogen 
infrastructure."
"The roles in the delivery of the project are clearly assigned: RWE contributes 
green hydrogen, while OGE transports it to customers."
"The plan is to construct electrolysers 
with a total capacity of 1 GW along the pipelines and also import large volumes of hydrogen 
by the end of the decade."
"We also intend to connect at least 2 GW of hydrogen-capable 
gas-fired power stations to the network."
"As the initiative is something of a herculean task, 
we searched for project partners early on."
"These efforts were successful as nearly 
30 companies are involved in H2ercules, including thyssenkrupp, Evonik and Uniper."
"They are paid 
to operators of firm generation capacities for participating in the market, and thus 
contributing to security of supply."
"This is due to the fact that conventional power plants  
(e."
"gas-fired power stations) will operate increasingly less frequently due to the expansion 
of renewables, which will weigh on electricity revenues."
"However, the plants are still needed 
to bridge phases of fluctuating wind and solar feed-ins."
"The reform package does not 
include a regulation that would have allowed countries to reintroduce future temporary 
special levies on electricity producers’ revenues."
"EU member states had previously briefly 
been granted the right to do so in response to the extreme electricity and fuel price rises  
due to Russia’s attack on Ukraine."
EU directive to accelerate renewable energy expansion.
"The European Parliament and 
the Council of Ministers passed a reform of the Renewable Energy Directive on 18 October 
2023."
"The now third version of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) entered into force 
on 20 November and must be translated into national law within 18 months."
"The 
amendment was made to account for the increase in the EU’s greenhouse gas reduction 
target for 2030 from 40 % to 55 % compared to 1990."
"Accordingly, RED III defines a more 
ambitious goal in relation to expanding renewable energy."
"The new target envisages green 
sources accounting for 42.5 % of energy consumption as early as 2030, as opposed to the 
32 % previously aimed for."
"It is the first time objectives have been introduced for individual 
sectors: the portion of renewable energy consumed by the manufacturing industry, for 
example, is required to increase by 1.6 % annually."
"The directive is designed to help member 
states overcome legal hurdles to expand renewable energy and to accelerate approval 
processes."
"From now on, green electricity projects will permanently be given legal priority."
This had already been granted by a temporary EU emergency directive in 2022.
"These 
projects are now treated as being of ‘overriding public interest’."
"Areas suitable for expanding 
renewables can now be designated as priority areas for such projects."
"The regulatory framework conditions for investments in renewables continued to 
improve in 2023."
"The European Union issued a directive outlining ambitious expansion 
targets, designed to help member states expedite approval procedures."
"The EU also 
agreed on an electricity market reform to incentivise investment in climate-friendly 
generation technologies."
"For now, it will not restore the special levy on electricity 
producers’ revenues."
"The decision was taken in light of calmer commodity markets and 
lower electricity prices compared to the record highs seen in 2022."
"Regulatory environment
Agreement on EU electricity market reform."
"At the end of 2023, the European Parliament 
and the Council of Ministers reached an agreement on an electricity market reform in a 
trilogue with the European Commission."
"It still needs to be formally approved before it is 
enshrined in law."
"The reform was triggered by Russia’s war on Ukraine and the resulting 
disruptions in the energy sector."
"By introducing the measures, the EU wants to reduce the 
electricity market’s dependence on fuel imports and optimise it for the expansion of 
renewable energy."
"The EU states decided to refrain from changing the way in which prices 
are formed, i."
based on supply and demand.
"They are, however, looking to rely increasingly 
on contracts for difference (CfD) to bolster planning security for investments in renewables 
and nuclear assets."
"These contracts guarantee asset operators a fixed remuneration: if the 
price the plant operators realise on the market is below a contractually guaranteed level, 
they can claim the difference from the state."
"If it exceeds the strike price, they must pay back 
the difference."
"The Parliament and Council of Ministers also endorse the use of CfDs to 
extend the lifetimes of existing power stations."

EU aligns Emissions Trading System with new climate goals."
"In its quest to hit its 
ambitious climate targets, the EU also reformed the European Emissions Trading 
System (EU ETS)."
The amendment became effective on 5 June 2023.
"It obliges the sectors 
covered by the EU ETS (energy, industry, and internal European aviation) to reduce their total 
greenhouse gas emissions by 62 % by 2030 compared to 2005."
"This replaces the former 
goal of 43 %."
"To accelerate decarbonisation, the EU will reduce the number of certificates 
placed on the market by an annual 4.3 % (from 2024) and 4.4 % (from 2028)."
"Until recently, 
the reduction factor had been 2.2 %."
"Another measure is designed to target the excess 
emission allowances in circulation: over the course of the current decade, 24 % of the 
surplus will continue to be retained annually and transferred to the market stability reserve."
"According to the former legislation, the quota would have been lowered to 12 % in 2024."
"The reform also envisages a separate emissions trading scheme (EU ETS 2) for the 
transportation and building sectors, which should be set up by 2028."
EU establishes criteria for ‘green’ hydrogen.
"In July 2023, an EU directive entered into 
force defining the criteria that electrolysed hydrogen must meet to be classed as ‘green’."
"Green hydrogen is likely to be eligible for state support, as it is produced with electricity that 
was generated using renewables."
"Following the EU directive, hydrogen can be classed as 
green even in cases where the electrolysers used for its production are not directly 
connected to a renewable energy facility but instead rely on electricity from the public  
grid."
"Companies producing hydrogen in countries where the power supply does not 
predominantly come from zero-carbon energy sources must satisfy certain conditions:  
they are required to conclude power purchase agreements with additional, non-subsidised 
renewables plants located in the same market."
"In addition, the directive stipulates that 
timing of the hydrogen production must coincide with the electricity being fed into the grid."
Extraordinary levy on electricity revenues expires.
"On 30 June 2023, Germany’s special 
levy on power producers’ revenues expired as planned."
"It had been introduced on 
1 December 2022 in response to the soaring energy prices and was established to help 
finance relief packages for electricity customers among other things."
"The federal 
government had the option of extending the levy period to 30 April 2024, which it did not 
take advantage of."
"The EU had enshrined the cornerstones for national electricity revenue 
levies in European law in September 2022."
"Mid-2023 was the recommended expiry 
deadline, however, it was exceeded by a number of countries."
"Poland, for example, applied 
the levy until the end of 2023."
"Conversely, the Dutch government set the same levy period 
as Germany (1 December 2022 to 30 June 2023)."
German government formalises funding plans for new power stations.
"In February 2024, 
the German government presented the cornerstones of its power station strategy."
"The 
approach comprises two stages: tendering processes for new low-carbon power stations 
and the introduction of a capacity mechanism."
"The state is looking to utilise these measures 
to ensure that, despite the planned coal exit, there is sufficient back-up capacity to bridge 
phases with low wind or solar feed-ins."
"Incentives are needed to ensure these backup assets 
remain economically viable as they are expected to only be deployed for a relatively short 
amount of time."
"The German government is looking to start the tendering processes for the 
construction of gas-fired power stations with a total capacity of up to 10 GW as quickly as 
possible."
"The plants must be retrofitted to run exclusively on hydrogen instead of natural gas 
by 2035 to 2040."
A decision as to the exact deadline is expected by 2032.
"The incentives 
will be financed by the German government’s flagship Climate and Transformation Fund."
"The second stage of the strategy is dedicated to the introduction of a technology-neutral 
capacity mechanism, which is expected to be up and running by no later than 2028."
"Operators of reliably available generation assets receive the capacity payments as a 
secondary compensation component in addition to electricity revenue (see page 30)."

As a next step, the German government will liaise with the EU Commission on the tender 
processes."
"There is expected to be a public consultation and the governing parties will also 
need to agree on the capacity mechanism design."
Details of additional US support for renewable energy published.
"The USA’s national tax 
authority (Internal Revenue Service) has specified the criteria which companies must meet 
in order for investments in green technologies to become eligible for additional funding 
beyond conventional tax incentives."
"The Inflation Reduction Act, a legislative package 
approved in 2022 to finance social measures and climate protection, provides the legal 
basis for these criteria."
"New wind and solar farms as well as other green projects can now 
apply for additional funding if large parts of their value chain are carried out in the USA."
"The 
government expects the measure to bolster the local supply chain."
"An additional incentive is 
also targeting investments in regions with certain disadvantages (e."
"pollution) or that are 
particularly impacted by changes within the energy industry."
"The aim here is to create new 
local job opportunities."
"Projects can receive multiple incentives at once if they meet the 
necessary criteria."
"The bonuses are granted on top of traditional production tax credits and 
investment tax credits, which can be used to offset tax liabilities."
"The value of these credits 
depends on the volume of electricity generated or – alternatively – the investment costs."
"Market environment
Weak economic growth in Europe."
"Based on current data, global economic output in 2023 
was some 3 % higher year on year."
Growth figures in Europe were much lower.
"Germany’s 
economic performance was particularly disappointing: it shrank by 0.3 %."
"Conversely, the 
UK and the Netherlands grew by around 0.5 %."
"The ongoing war in Ukraine, rising interest 
rates and energy costs continued to weigh on growth."
"Although electricity and commodity 
prices dropped below the record highs seen in 2022, they remained high compared to the 
long-term average."
"The US economy experienced a comparatively solid development: 
according to preliminary estimates, the country’s economy grew by 2.5 %."
Power consumption down in RWE’s core markets.
"Provisional surveys carried out by the 
German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW) indicate that electricity 
consumption in Germany dropped by 3 % compared to 2022."
"Experts believe that this was 
primarily due to weak industrial production and energy savings in response to high prices."
"In 
the UK, power consumption decreased by 2 %, whereas in the Netherlands, it dropped only 
slightly below the previous year’s level."
"Estimates for the USA have power consumption 
declining by around 1 %."
Wind speeds rise in Europe and fall in the USA.
"Utilisation of renewable assets is largely 
weather-dependent."
Wind velocities are particularly important for our business.
"In 2023, 
they matched or exceeded the long-term average at most RWE sites in Central Europe, 
whereas they were mostly below it in South and North-West Europe as well as North 
America."
"Wind speeds at our wind farms in Europe tended to be more favourable than in 
2022, whereas they were poorer in the USA."
"Utilisation of our run-of-river power plants 
strongly depends on precipitation and meltwater volumes."
"In Germany, our main 
hydropower region, these volumes were roughly in line with the long-term average and were 
significantly higher compared to 2022."

Fuel prices drop significantly from 2022 record highs."
"The utilisation and earnings of our 
conventional power plants are dependent on how electricity, fuel and emission allowance 
prices develop."
"Commodity markets eased at the beginning of 2023, after the extreme 
price spikes in the previous year due to the war in Ukraine."
"Quotations declined significantly 
especially in gas trading, which had been surrounded by particular uncertainty due to 
disruptions in supply from Russia."
"Averaged for the year, spot prices at the Dutch Title 
Transfer Facility (TTF), the reference market for Continental Europe, amounted to €41 / MWh 
in 2023, i."
just a third of the prior-year level (€124 / MWh).
"This was due to the easing of 
the gas supply situation despite the continued war in Ukraine."
"Low consumption as a result 
of the mild winter of 2022 / 2023 and the weak economy as well as increased LNG imports 
ensured healthy gas storage levels."
"The more favourable supply situation was also reflected 
in gas forward trading prices."
The TTF forward for 2024 averaged €52 / MWh last year.
"By way of comparison, in 2022, the 2023 TTF forward traded at €114 / MWh."
"Deliveries to ARA ports (ARA = Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp) including freight 
and insurance were settled on the spot market for an average of US$129 / metric ton in 
2023."
The prior-year figure stood at US$290 / metric ton).
"Global supply chains were 
reconfigured following the disruption triggered by the war in Ukraine."
"Russian coal deliveries 
to Europe, which had dominated the market until the start of 2022, were replaced by 
supplies from Colombia, South Africa and the USA."
"A weaker Chinese economy and 
comparatively low utilisation of European coal-fired power stations had a dampening effect."
Forward trading prices also declined significantly.
"In 2023, the 2024 forward (API 2 Index) 
traded for an average of US$127 / metric ton."
"This is US$95 less than had been quoted for 
the 2023 forward the year prior."
CO2 emission allowance prices: record highs followed by downward trend.
"The cost of 
procuring CO2 emission allowances is an important factor for fossil fuel-fired power 
stations."
"A European Union Allowance (EUA), entitling the holder to emit one metric ton of 
carbon dioxide, traded at an average of €89 in 2023 – compared to €84 the year prior."
"This 
figure is based on forward contracts that mature in December of the following year."
"In the 
first quarter, EUAs traded for up to €105, after which they became cheaper, intermittently 
dropping below the €70 mark in late 2023."
"The record prices early in the year were in part 
caused by the EU establishing the regulatory framework for a faster reduction of the 
number of available emission allowances, with a view to achieving its new greenhouse gas 
emission target for 2030 (see page 31)."
"However, there were also factors which drove down 
demand for emission allowances and thus had a dampening effect on prices: these 
included the decline in industrial production and lower utilisation of coal-fired power plants."
"In addition, the EU started putting further emission allowances on the market in the second 
half of the year."
"The proceeds are being used to finance the REPowerEU package of 
measures, with which the European Union seeks to accelerate the green transition and put 
an end to its dependence on Russian fuel."

In the UK, which has its own CO2 emissions trading system, the price of certificates dropped."
"During 2023, UK Allowances (UKAs) traded at an average of £59 compared to £83 last 
year."
"This trend is due in part to a drop in industrial production, which reduced the need for 
certificates."
"The United Kingdom introduced stricter rules to its emission trading system,  
in order to align it with the country’s ambitious net-zero target."
"However, the British 
government also decided to place additional certificates on the market from 2024 to 
2027, in order to facilitate the transition for market participants."
"The announcement of this 
measure made a major contribution to the decline in price."
Electricity prices fall as fuel markets relax.
"Wholesale electricity prices also dropped 
considerably, but remained elevated, mirroring the development of the commodity markets."
"In the fiscal year that just ended, base-load power traded for an average of €95 / MWh on 
the German spot market, compared to €235 / MWh in 2022."
"Spot prices declined from 
£206 / MWh to £94 / MWh in the United Kingdom and from €243 / MWh to € 96 / MWh in 
the Netherlands."
"Electricity forward trading painted the following picture: in Germany, the 
2024 base-load forward cost an average of €137 / MWh, whereas companies paid 
€298 / MWh for the 2023 forward the year prior."
"The price of the one-year forward declined 
from £265 / MWh to £125 / MWh in the United Kingdom and from €263 / MWh to 
€128 / MWh in the Netherlands."
"The North American electricity market is subdivided into different regions, which are 
managed by independent grid companies."
"Currently, the most important market for us is 
Texas, where the power grid is operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)."
This is the grid most of our US wind farms are connected to.
"Here, the electricity spot price 
averaged US$55 / MWh in 2023 compared to US$66 / MWh in the prior year."
"The one-year 
forward dropped from US$57 / MWh to US$46 / MWh."
"One reason was that natural gas has 
also become cheaper in the USA."
"This lowered the generation costs of gas-fired power 
plants, which are often the price-setters on the North American electricity market."
Improved margins on electricity forward sales.
"In order to mitigate risks associated with 
earnings, we sell most of our power generation forward and hedge the prices for the 
necessary fuel and emission allowances using forward transactions with a lead time of up to 
three years."
"The margins realised in the past fiscal year were thus greatly defined by the 
conditions of the 2023 forward contracts, which were concluded in previous years."
"We 
achieved better margins with these forward sales for most of our power stations than we did 
in 2022."
"Margins realised for spot trading were markedly down on the previous year’s level, 
reflecting the decline in power prices."
"Energy markets continued to be volatile in 2023, 
which once again enabled us to achieve high earnings from the short-term optimisation of 
our power plant dispatch."
Supply chain pressures in the energy industry.
"Beyond the regulatory framework and 
energy prices, our business can also be shaped by events in the supply chain."
"Companies 
such as RWE that have set themselves ambitious renewables expansion targets source a 
large portion of their plant components and logistics services from international suppliers."
"In recent years, procurement has become increasingly challenging."
"Bottlenecks can often 
only be avoided by placing orders early on and sourcing products from a broad range of 
suppliers."
"Rising inflation and resulting cost increases also created problems for the 
industry, while geopolitical tensions posed challenges when planning investments."
"This 
affected the procurement of solar modules from Asia, among other things."
"Potential trade 
embargoes or import duties could disrupt supply chains and force companies to source 
expensive substitutes in other markets."
"Our acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses positioned 
us as one of the biggest solar power producers in the United States."
"We paved the way 
for offshore wind projects in Germany, Ireland and Japan by successfully participating 
in the respective auctions and also secured an offtake contract for a wind farm we are 
planning in the New York Bight."
"Furthermore, we reached an agreement to take over 
three large-scale projects from Vattenfall which will now play an important part in our 
wind expansion plans for the British North Sea."
"In this chapter, we present the major 
events that occurred in the period between January 2023 and February 2024."
"We will 
focus on developments which have not been discussed in more detail elsewhere in the 
review of operations."
RWE acquires Con Edison’s renewable energy business.
"­
On 1 March 2023, we purchased 
Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, a former subsidiary of US-based firm Con Edison 
specialising in renewables."
"We have gained power generation assets totalling 3.1 GW, 
approximately 90 % of which are solar systems."
"We also received a development pipeline for 
plants with a total installed capacity of more than 7 GW."
"Following the transaction, we are 
now positioned as one of the largest renewables players in the USA."
"The purchase price for 
Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses was US$4.1 billion."
"Including assumed net debt this 
results in an enterprise value of US$6.8 billion."
"The move was financed in part with the 
issuance of a mandatory convertible bond to Qatar Holding, a subsidiary of the Qatar 
Investment Authority."
"The €2,428-million bond was issued on 10 October 2022 and 
converted into 67,621,169 new RWE shares on 15 March 2023."
"The total number of our 
shares now amounts to 743,841,217."
"The shares held by Qatar Holding represent 9.1 % of 
the increased capital stock."
"As soon as the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses had been completed, we 
consolidated our American onshore wind, photovoltaic and storage activities to form the 
new company RWE Clean Energy."
"The firm had more than 1,600 employees at the end of 
2023 and renewable assets totalling 9.2 GW."
RWE acquires three UK offshore wind projects from Vattenfall.
"We will be taking over 
three large-scale offshore wind power projects off the coast of Norfolk in the east of 
England from Swedish energy company Vattenfall."
"The transaction was agreed in 
December 2023 and is expected to be completed in the spring of 2024 once all the 
necessary approvals have been granted."
"The purchase price corresponds to a portfolio 
value of £963 million."
"The majority of the funds covers Vattenfall’s historical development 
expenditure."
"The three projects – Norfolk Vanguard West, Norfolk Vanguard East and 
Norfolk Boreas – each have a planned capacity of up to 1.4 GW."
"After 13 years of 
development, all the relevant permits and grid connections have been granted."
"Norfolk 
Vanguard West and Norfolk Vanguard East are the most advanced and come with 
preliminary contracts for the procurement of key components."
"Next in the development of 
these projects, they will need to be granted Contracts for Difference (CfD) at an upcoming 
auction, guaranteeing a set price for any power generated."
"Vattenfall had put the third 
project, Norfolk Boreas, on hold."
"However, we plan to continue developing it."
"All the offshore 
wind farms in the Norfolk pipeline are expected to become operational over the course of 
the current decade."

RWE and Masdar join forces to develop Dogger Bank South wind power projects."
"We 
have formed a partnership with Abu Dhabi-based clean energy firm Masdar to realise two 
offshore wind projects, which are planned for the southern section of Dogger Bank in the 
British North Sea."
"The agreement was reached in late 2023 with the joint venture becoming 
effective at the end of February 2024, once all the necessary regulatory approvals had 
been received."
"Masdar now holds a 49 % stake in both Dogger Bank South projects and has 
contributed to the already incurred project costs accordingly."
"RWE owns 51 % and is 
responsible for building and running the assets."
"Dogger Bank is a significant expanse of 
shallow sandbank off the north-east coast of England."
"The two wind farm projects are 
expected to each have an installed capacity of up to 1.5 GW and be completed by late 
2031."
"We are currently also building our 1.4 GW wind farm Sofia on Dogger Bank, which is 
set to take all turbines online in 2026."
"This project is being delivered by the RWE Group 
alone."
New York to purchase power from RWE offshore wind farm.
"We hit a key milestone in the 
delivery of our offshore wind project located off the coast of New York."
"In October 2023, the 
state of New York agreed to purchase the electricity from turbines with a total capacity of 
1.3 GW at our tendered conditions."
"This followed an auction process in which a total of three 
projects were successful."
"The weighted average strike price for the three projects came to 
US$145.07 / MWh over 25 years."
"The agreed price for RWE’s project has not yet been 
announced."
"Until the construction and operation plan has been approved, it will be indexed 
based on a number of factors – certain price indices, for example."
"A joint venture, in which 
we hold a 73 % stake and National Grid Ventures has a 27 % holding, is responsible for the 
offshore wind project near New York, known as ‘Community Offshore Wind’."
"In early 2022, 
this venture had secured a lease to a site which could accommodate turbines with a total 
installed capacity of more than 3 GW."
"If the project progresses according to plan, we will 
commission the first Community Offshore Wind turbines by the end of the decade."
Auction success for RWE’s first Irish offshore wind farm.
"We are one step closer to 
realising our first offshore wind farm project in Ireland."
"In an auction run by the Irish Grid 
operator EirGrid, we secured a two-sided contract for difference for Dublin Array, our 
824 MW wind farm project."
The contract has a term of 20 years.
"It guarantees us an 
attractive power price, which is confidential."
"The weighted average strike price of all 
successful bids at the auction was €86.05 / MWh."
"Dublin Array will be located approximately 
10 kilometres off the coastline of counties Dublin and Wicklow."
"RWE is developing the 
project together with Irish wind developer Saorgus Energy."
"The partners each hold a 50 % 
stake."
We expect to complete the wind farm in 2028.
RWE enters the Japanese market with a winning bid for offshore wind project.
"In late 
2023, we celebrated a breakthrough in the development of our first offshore wind power 
project in the Asia-Pacific region."
"In a tender process, the government of Japan selected a 
consortium comprising RWE, Mitsui and Osaka Gas to deliver an offshore wind project off 
the coast of the island nation."
"The project will be realised in Niigata Prefecture, where the 
partners plan to build and operate a wind farm with a total installed capacity of 684 MW."
"They will be able to market the electricity freely, and the state has guaranteed a minimum 
strike price of JP¥ 3,000 / MWh (€20)."
"The wind farm is expected to comprise over 
38 turbines, which are scheduled to go online in 2029 provided the project progresses  
as planned."
RWE secures wind power sites in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.
"In Germany and 
the USA we successfully participated in a number of auctions for the rights to develop 
offshore wind sites."
"In August 2023, the Federal Network Agency announced that we had 
been awarded two sites in the North Sea, N-3.5 and N-3.6 (Nordseecluster B), where we 
want to build wind farms with 900 MW of total installed capacity."
"We were awarded the 
development rights at no cost, but the electricity we generate will not be eligible for a 
guaranteed price."
Both sites are located around 50 kilometres north of the island of Juist.
"We had already secured two neighbouring sites, N-3.7 and N-3.8 (Nordseecluster A), at an 
auction in 2021."
The sites could accommodate a total potential capacity of 660 MW.
"We 
are the sole owner of the Nordseecluster projects."
"Our previous partner, Canadian power 
producer Northland Power sold us their 49 % stake for €34 million in May 2023."
"Our success streak continued in August when our winning bid of US$5.6 million secured a 
lease area in the Gulf of Mexico which one day could be home to 2 GW of installed offshore 
wind capacity."
"The site is located around 70 kilometres off the coast of the US state of 
Louisiana and is noted for having shallow waters."
"If the project progresses as planned, the 
wind farm will be commissioned in 2035."
Kaskasi wind farm in the North Sea inaugurated.
"In March 2023, we inaugurated Kaskasi 
our new German offshore wind farm in the presence of Robert Habeck, Federal Minister for 
Economic Affairs and Climate Action."
"The 342 MW facility is located 35 kilometres to the 
north of Heligoland."
All 38 of its turbines have been online since late 2022.
"The ceremony 
marked Kaskasi’s move into regular operations, following a test period during which it was 
already producing electricity."
"We are the sole owner of the wind farm and have invested 
around €850 million in the project."
"Three turbines have been fitted with recyclable rotor 
blades from Siemens Gamesa, which were manufactured using a novel resin."
"This allows for 
the composite materials to be separated after use."
"Kaskasi is the first wind farm in the world 
to use these environmentally friendly blades."
RWE now a leading solar developer the UK.
"By acquiring London-based project developer 
JBM Solar in March 2023, we laid the foundation for the rapid expansion of our British 
photovoltaics business."
The purchase price amounted to £318 million.
"At the time of the 
acquisition, JBM Solar had a 6.1 GW development pipeline comprising 3.8 GW of 
photovoltaic assets and 2.3 GW of battery storage."
"The transaction has placed RWE among 
the top three solar developers in the UK."
"Most of JBM Solar’s projects are being developed in 
the Midlands and the South of England."
"We expect the first assets in the pipeline to become 
operational in late 2024."
RWE’s largest battery completed.
"Midway through the year, we took our largest battery 
storage system to date online in Fresno County, California."
"The plant has the ability to 
discharge 137 MW into the grid over a four-hour period, giving it a storage capacity of 
548 MWh."
"The battery forms part of the Fifth Standard project, which also comprises a  
150 MW solar farm, completed in September 2023."
"The system comprises 370,000 solar 
panels spanning 1,600 hectares."
"With the help of solar trackers, the modules follow the 
position of the sun, which improves energy output."
"In addition, the storage system is able to 
optimise the timings of feed-ins to the local grid."
Czech Republic: Grid operator ČEPS buys gas storage business from RWE.
"In September 
2023, we sold our Group company RWE Gas Storage CZ to the Czech state-owned 
transmission system operator ČEPS for €372 million, resulting in a book gain of 
€128 million."
"RWE Gas Storage CZ is the Czech Republic’s market leader and operates six 
underground gas storage facilities with an operating volume of 2.7 billion cubic metres."
"The 
company was no longer considered to be part of our core activities."
"We will, however, be 
retaining our German gas storage facilities."
"They are located in salt caverns, which are 
particularly well-suited for storing hydrogen due to their geological composition."
Dutch gas-fired power station Magnum now owned by RWE.
"On 31 January 2023, we 
acquired the Magnum gas-fired power plant in the Netherlands from Vattenfall."
"The facility 
has been in operation since 2013, and has a net capacity of 1.4 GW."
"It is considered to be 
one of the most modern power stations in the Netherlands."
"We paid €430 million for the 
plant."
The transaction includes a neighbouring solar farm with a capacity of 5.6 MW.
Magnum is located a stone’s throw away from our Eemshaven power station.
"The joint use 
of the local infrastructure will allow us to leverage considerable synergies."
"Magnum would 
only need minor technical retrofits to run on 30 % hydrogen."
"There is also the option to 
transition to 100 % hydrogen in the long term."
"This will allow the power station to be part of 
the future hydrogen infrastructure which we are looking to build together with local energy 
and manufacturing partners in the province of Groningen."

RWE and Equinor agree strategic partnership."
"In January 2023, RWE and Norwegian 
energy company Equinor entered into a strategic partnership to drive the ramp-up of the 
hydrogen economy and the expansion of renewables."
"The two companies want to harness 
Norwegian hydrogen to help decarbonise the German energy industry through a number of 
large-scale projects."
"The plan is for Equinor to create up to 2 GW of capacity for producing 
blue hydrogen in its domestic market of Norway by 2030."
"Blue hydrogen is derived from 
natural gas and the resulting carbon dioxide is stored underground."
"The hydrogen would be 
transported via a North Sea pipeline to Germany, where it could be used e."
"In addition, RWE and Equinor are considering building offshore wind farms and 
electrolysers near the North Sea pipeline, so green hydrogen, which is expected to slowly 
replace blue hydrogen, can be fed into the grid."
"Furthermore, there are plans to potentially 
collaborate with Equinor on building hydrogen capable gas-fired power stations at German 
sites."
"Wind energy projects in Norway and Germany that are exclusively focused on power 
generation are also on the cards."
"The realisation of these major joint ventures is largely 
contingent on the completion of the aforementioned North Sea pipeline."
"Furthermore, 
Germany would need to have a suitable regulatory framework for investments in new  
gas-fired power plants as well as sufficient hydrogen infrastructure."
Grid stability reserve plant commissioned in Biblis.
"Our new 300 MW gas-fired power 
station in Biblis, South Hesse, Germany, went online in March 2023."
"It took about two years 
to build."
"The facility will not be used to generate power for the electricity market, but will 
instead only fire up when prompted by the transmission system operator."
"Its sole purpose is 
to help stabilise grid frequency, thus contributing to security of supply."
RWE proves successful at British capacity market auctions.
"We secured capacity 
payments for all RWE power plants participating in two British capacity market auctions in 
February 2023 and 2024."
"The first auction related to the period from 1 October 2026 to 
30 September 2027 and RWE power stations with a combined secured capacity of 
6,638 MW were successful."
Almost all of the assets in question are gas-fired.
"The auction 
cleared at £63 / kW (plus inflation adjustment)."
"We will receive this amount for making our 
assets available during the above period and thus contributing to power supply."
"The second 
auction was dedicated to the period between 1 October 2027 and 30 September 2028, 
where RWE capacity totalling 6,353 MW was successful."
"We will receive a capacity payment 
of £65 / kW (plus inflation adjustment)."
Three RWE lignite units temporarily back online.
"In early autumn 2023, our lignite-fired 
units Niederaussem E and F as well as Neurath C returned to the grid in order to allow for 
natural gas savings in electricity production, if necessary."
"The German government had 
passed the necessary ordinance in early October."
"The motion was rooted in the German 
Substitute Power Stations Act, which had been enacted in 2022 against the backdrop of 
the war in Ukraine and the sharp reduction in Russian gas supplies."
"In doing so, the Federal 
government allowed for numerous coal-fired power stations and one oil-fired power plant 
to go back online in order to bridge potential shortages."
"Our three lignite-fired units initially 
returned to the market until June 2023."
"Operations will draw to a close at the end of March 
2024."
We will then shut them down for good.

EU approves compensation for lignite exit."
"At the end of 2023, the European Commission 
greenlit the €2.6 billion in compensation payments agreed in 2020 for the early phaseout 
of lignite-fired power generation in the Rhenish coal-mining region."
"The compensation was 
rooted in the Coal Phaseout Act as well as a public-law contract between the German 
government and RWE, but was still subject to EU state aid approval."
"It will be paid in annual 
instalments until 2030."
"At the end of last year, the state transferred all instalments for the 
period between 2020 and 2023 totalling €692 million."
"The payment will have no impact on 
our earnings."
"It reduces compensation claims against the state, which were already 
accounted for."
"We have met our obligations under the Coal Phaseout Act according to the 
prescribed timeline."
"Since late 2020, we have shut down five lignite-fired units and halted 
our briquette production operations in Frechen, which has weighed significantly on earnings."
"In addition, we have shouldered considerable costs from the premature closing of our 
Hambach opencast mine and socially acceptable redundancy schemes."
"Since then,  
we have taken the decision to go further than required by the 2020 legislation."
"In 2022,  
we reached an agreement with the Federal government and the state of North Rhine-
Westphalia to bring our lignite exit forward to 2030 – eight years earlier than originally 
envisaged."
The Coal Phaseout Act has been amended accordingly.
"We will not be receiving 
any additional compensation for expediting the exit."
Netherlands: RWE to be compensated for limited coal usage in 2022.
"The Dutch 
government has resolved to pay us €332 million in compensation for restricting coal-fired 
generation in the first half of 2022."
"The cap was imposed as part of an amendment to coal 
phaseout legislation enacted in 2021, which stipulated that between 2022 and 2024, 
annual CO2 emissions from coal-fired power generation should not exceed 35 % of the 
individual power plant’s theoretical capacity."
"The operators have been granted 
compensation."
"Motivated by the war in Ukraine and the strained energy supply situation,  
the Dutch government lifted the cap on coal-fired generation in June 2022."
"The agreed 
compensation is subject to approval by the EU Commission under state aid law."
"It has been 
included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements as a contingent asset with no effect 
on profit or loss."
Gersteinwerk proves successful at German capacity reserve auction.
"Our natural gas 
combined-cycle units F, G and K 1 at the Gersteinwerk site in Werne (Westphalia) have all 
been accepted into the German capacity reserve for the period between 1 October 2024 
and 30 September 2026."
"The decision was made in February 2024 as part of a tender 
process by the Federal Network Agency."
"Altogether, the sites will provide a total of 820 MW 
of reserve capacity, which can be used to ensure grid stability as required."
"We will receive a 
capacity payment of €99.99 per kilowatt and year."
"Units F and G had already submitted 
winning bids at the first two tenders of this kind."
"As reserve power stations, they have not 
operated on the regular electricity market since 1 October 2020, and can only be fired up 
when required to do so by the transmission system operator."
"This was the first time unit K 1 
participated in the capacity reserve tender."
Emsland nuclear plant taken off the grid.
"On 15 April 2023, our last German nuclear 
power station went offline."
"The Emsland plant in Lingen had a net capacity of 1,336 MW 
and had securely produced zero-carbon electricity since 1988."
"It was one of three German 
nuclear power plants that were still online last year."
"Originally, the assets should have been 
decommissioned at the end of 2022 due to the German nuclear phaseout."
"However, the 
German government delayed regulatory decommissioning by three-and-a-half months to 
mid-April to ensure security of supply in the 2022 / 2023 winter."
Katja van Doren assumes role of Chief Human Resources Officer at RWE AG.
"On 
1 August 2023, Katja van Doren took office as Chief Human Resources Officer and Labour 
Director of RWE AG."
"Her Executive Board mandate also includes responsibility for IT, Internal 
Audit & Safety and Corporate Transformation."
"She succeeds Zvezdana Seeger, whose 
Executive Board contract was not extended at her own request."
"Katja van Doren studied 
business management, before working for KPMG as an auditor and tax consultant."
"She then 
moved to RWE in 1999 and joined the Board of RWE Generation at the beginning of 2018, 
where she was responsible for Finance and HR."
"Our activities relating to renewable energy, gas-fired 
power plants, energy ­
storage, hydrogen and energy trading are distributed among  
the first four segments."
"They make up our core business, which we intend to grow."
"The 
fifth segment covers our lignite and nuclear operations, which are of no strategic 
significance to us due to legally mandated phaseout ­
roadmaps."
Group structure with five segments.
"This report is based on a Group structure comprising 
five segments."
"Operating responsibility for the activities they encompass is borne by 
subsidiaries of RWE AG."
"The segments, the first four of which represent our core business, 
are divided as follows:
1."
"
Offshore Wind: We present our business relating to offshore wind here."
"It is overseen  
by RWE Offshore Wind."
"
Onshore Wind / Solar: This is the segment in which we pool our onshore wind and solar 
business as well as parts of our battery storage activities."
"Depending on the continent, 
they are managed by RWE Renewables Europe & Australia or RWE Clean Energy, which 
operates in America."
"
Hydro / Biomass / Gas: Our run-of-river, pumped storage, biomass and gas-fired power 
stations are pooled here."
"The segment also includes the Dutch Amer and ­
Eemshaven 
power plants, which run on biomass and hard coal, as well as individual ­
battery  
storage systems."
"The project management and engineering consulting company 
RWE Technology International and our 37.9 % stake in Austrian energy utility KELAG are 
also allocated to this segment."
"The activities are overseen by RWE Generation, which is 
also responsible for designing and implementing our hydrogen strategy."
"
Supply & Trading: Proprietary trading of electricity and other energy commodities is at 
the core of this ­
segment."
It is managed by RWE Supply & Trading.
"The company oversees  
a broad range of activities."

"Added to this are our remaining nuclear 
activities including RWE’s investments in Dutch nuclear power plant operator EPZ (30 %) 
and Germany-based URANIT (50 %), which holds a 33 % stake in uranium enrichment 
specialist Urenco."
Operating responsibility in this segment is borne by RWE Power.
"We 
have assigned the shareholdings in EPZ and URANIT to other segments as of 1 January 
2024."
The remaining activities have been renamed ‘phaseout technologies’.

Restatement of prior-year figures."
"We adopted a different accounting policy for changes 
in quotations of money market funds at the beginning of fiscal 2023."
"These used to be 
assigned to the non-operating result."
"For reasons of consistency, we now recognise them  
in the adjusted financial result, where we also record income streams from these funds."
"To ensure the comparability of current and prior-year figures, we restated the latter."
We also changed the recognition of compensation received for redispatch measures.
"These are requests by transmission system operators for generation assets to adjust power 
feed-ins, aiming to protect grids from overloads."
"In the past, compensation received for 
production losses caused by redispatch measures were stated under other operating 
income."
Now we recognise them in revenue.
"This adjustment was made with effect from 
1 January 2023 and is reflected retrospectively in fiscal 2022 figures."
Forward-looking statements.
"This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements 
regarding the future development of the RWE Group and its companies as well as economic 
and ­
political developments."
"These statements are assessments that we have made based 
on information available to us at the time this document was prepared."
"Despite this, actual 
developments can deviate from our expectations, for instance, if underlying assumptions do 
not materialise or unforeseen risks arise."
"Therefore, we cannot assume responsibility for the 
correctness of forward-looking statements."
"Adjusted EBITDA totalled 
€8.4 billion, which was substantially higher than the expected range of €5.8 billion to 
€6.4 billion."
"This was due to our continued very strong trading performance and 
significant income from the commercial optimisation of our power plant dispatch."
We also easily surpassed the year-earlier figure.

solar farms as well as our acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses had a

electricity from waste-to-energy plants).
More electricity from renewables than coal for the first time.
"Last year, RWE generated 
129,701 GWh of electricity."
"Renewable energy sources contributed 35 % of this total, 
surpassing coal (30 %) for the first time in our corporate history."
"Generation volumes were 
17 % down on 2022."
"Production from our lignite-fired power stations decreased 
significantly."
Unfavourable market conditions were a major factor.
"In addition, there were 
prolonged, unplanned outages for maintenance."
"Further volume shortfalls resulted from the 
German nuclear phaseout."
"As set out on page 39, we shut down Emsland, our last German 
nuclear power plant, on 15 April 2023."
"Utilisation of our two Dutch hard coal and biomass-fired power stations in Amer and 
Eemshaven was also down on 2022 due to worsening market conditions for these assets 
and limited availability due to repair work."
"Electricity generation from natural gas varied  
by region."
"Volume reductions in the United Kingdom and Germany were contrasted by 
increases in the Netherlands and Türkiye."
"This development is due in part to local market 
conditions."
"Other factors included prolonged outages for maintenance in the UK and the 
first-time consideration of production volumes from our newly acquired Dutch power 
station, Magnum, which joined our fleet on 31 January 2023."
"The single-largest gain came  
from solar."
"This was thanks to our acquisition of US energy firm Con Edison Clean Energy 
Businesses as of 1 March 2023, which we have included in our reporting since then."
"More 
detailed information on this transaction can be found on page 35."
"In the wind business, we 
registered 9 % growth, which was primarily driven by more favourable weather conditions 
and the continued expansion of our generation capacities."
"2023 was the first year our two 
North Sea wind farms Triton Knoll (857 MW) off the east coast of England and Kaskasi 
(342 MW) near Heligoland, Germany, had all their turbines online."
"Conversely, German 
offshore wind energy feed-ins had to be curtailed multiple times due to grid congestion."
"In addition to our in-house generation, we procure electricity from suppliers outside of the 
Group."
"In 2023, these purchases amounted to 36,499 GWh (previous year: 43,168 GWh)."
Significantly more renewable generation capacity.
"As of 31 December 2023, we had an 
installed power generation capacity of 44.4 GW, compared to 39.3 GW in the previous year."
The increase was predominantly driven by our Growing Green strategy.
"We made significant 
progress thanks to the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses."
"This transaction 
added solar and wind farms with a total capacity of 2,726 MW and 341 MW to our portfolio, 
making us one of the leading renewables companies in the USA."
"In addition, we completed 
several solar and wind projects last year."
"Our conventional generation capacity also rose, 
albeit marginally."
"This was mainly due to the acquisition of the Dutch 1,386 MW gas-fired 
power station Magnum and the commissioning of the 300 MW grid stabilisation facility in 
Biblis."
"Conversely, we lost 1,336 MW in generation capacity due to the shutdown of our 
Emsland nuclear power plant."
"Our biggest source of renewable energy is wind 
(11.9 GW), followed by solar (4.2 GW), biomass (0.8 GW) and hydro (0.5 GW)."
"The geographic focus of our generation business is Germany, where 34 % of our installed 
capacity is located, followed by the United Kingdom in second place at 24 %."
"As a result of 
the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, the USA advanced to third (20 %)."
"Taking renewable energy capacity alone, the United States takes the lead, with 47 %."

"Carbon dioxide emissions from power generation 
declined by 27 % to 60.6 million metric tons compared to 2022."
"The main reason for this 
was that utilisation of our coal and gas power stations was down considerably on the 
previous year."
"the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per megawatt 
hour of electricity generated, decreased from 0.53 metric tons to 0.46 metric tons."
"In 
addition to lower generation volumes from coal, the increased usage of climate-friendly 
generation technologies, i."

"Commercial rounding can result in inaccurate 
sum totals."
"We procure most of the fuel we need to 
generate electricity on international trading markets."
"However, lignite is sourced from 
proprietary opencast mines."
"In our Rhenish mining area west of Cologne, we produced 
48.2 million metric tons of lignite last year."
"This was 17.1 million metric tons less than in 
2022, owing to the marked decline in electricity generated by our lignite-fired power 
stations."
"We used the lion’s share, or 40.5 million metric tons, of the mined lignite to 
generate electricity."
"The remainder went towards manufacturing refined products  
(e."
"lignite powder and hearth furnace coke) and, to a limited extent, to generating process 
steam and district heat."
Electricity sales down 18 % year on year.
"In fiscal 2023, we sold 159,679 GWh of 
electricity and 42,391 GWh of gas."
"These volumes are largely attributable to the company 
RWE Supply & Trading, which markets most of the electricity generated by our power stations 
externally and is responsible for the gas business."
"We sold 18 % less of our main product, 
electricity, than in 2022, which reflected the decline in generation volumes."
"Deliveries in the 
gas business rose by 7 %."
"This was due in part to the acquisition of renewable energy 
company Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, which sells gas via a subsidiary to a limited 
extent."
"The rise was countered by a fall in demand from some of the key accounts we supply 
due to persistently high energy prices."
Electricity and gas revenue clearly down.
"Our external revenue (excluding natural gas 
tax / electricity tax) was down 26 %, amounting to €28,566 million."
"Electricity revenue 
dropped by 19 % to €25,082 million – largely due to a decrease in sales."
"Gas revenue 
declined by 62 % to €1,750 million, predominantly as a result of lower prices."
"1	 
Excluding natural gas tax / electricity tax."
Some prior-year figures restated; see commentary on page 41.
"At 20 %, the share of our coal-related revenues was slightly higher than the previous year, 
although we produced much less electricity from coal, and carbon dioxide emissions 
decreased accordingly."
"This was because we realised higher prices above all from forward 
sales of electricity produced by our coal-fired power stations, which offset the volume effect."
"Our adjusted earnings 
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) amounted to 
€8,378 million."
This is more than we had forecast.
"The outlook which was drawn up in March 
2023 and published on pages 63 et seq."
"of the 2022 Annual Report envisaged a range of 
€5.8 billion to €6.4 billion."
"We raised this forecast in July 2023 to between €7.1 billion and 
€7.7 billion."
"This new range was, again, exceeded."
"The fact that we performed much better 
than planned is due to the strong income from energy trading and commercial optimisation 
of power plant dispatch."
"Adjusted EBITDA posted by our core business amounted to 
€7,673 million."
"Our forecast in March envisaged this figure being between €4.8 billion and 
€5.4 billion."
"In the Coal / Nuclear segment, which does not form part of our core business,  
we recorded €705 million."
We had forecast €0.8 billion to €1.2 billion.
"Compared to the preceding year, our adjusted EBITDA improved by 33 %, driven in part by 
the aforementioned factors."
"What also came to bear was the impairment that we had to 
recognise for coal purchasing agreements with Russian producers which had weighed on 
2022 earnings (see page 38 of the 2022 Annual Report)."
"In addition, we benefited from the
first-time recognition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, acquired on 1 March 2023, 
as well as the commissioning of new wind and solar farms."
"Earnings contributed by German 
transmission system operator Amprion (RWE stake: 25.1 %) reported in ‘other, consolidation’ 
were exceptionally high due to a federal subsidy."
"The state funds are to cover additional 
expenses for system-related services, some of which have not been incurred yet."
"The following developments were observed in the segments: 
•	 Offshore Wind: At €1,664 million, adjusted EBITDA was within the forecast range of 
€1.4 billion to €1.8 billion and recorded an 18 % gain compared to 2022 (€1,412 million)."
"Wind levels were more favourable than in the prior year, especially at our UK offshore sites."
"In addition, electricity volumes which are not subject to guaranteed remuneration 
agreements and which we traded on the forward market, sold well."
"Our Kaskasi wind farm 
(342 MW) in the North Sea increased its contribution to earnings, as this was the first full 
year all its turbines were online."
"Increased operating and development costs weighed on 
earnings."
"•	 Onshore Wind / Solar: In this segment, adjusted EBITDA totalled €1,248 million, 
confirming our outlook which envisaged a range of €1.1 billion to €1.5 billion."
"The year-
earlier figure (€827 million) was exceeded by 51 %."
"This was mainly due to the takeover of 
Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses: the company’s business activities, acquired on  
1 March 2023, contributed €420 million to adjusted EBITDA."
"Capital gains from the sale 
of equity holdings in Italy among other things, as well as the commissioning of new wind 
and solar farms had a positive effect."
"However, realised electricity prices failed to match 
2022 levels."
"Furthermore, operating and development costs increased."
"Due to the volatility of the 
energy markets, we achieved unusually high earnings from the commercial optimisation 
of our power plant dispatch."
"This was one of the reasons why adjusted EBITDA was also up 
on the previous year (€2,369 million)."
"Higher margins on electricity forward sales were 
another contributing factor."
"Moreover, we realised capital gains on the sale of former 
plant premises."
"•	 Supply & Trading: Our energy trading performance clearly exceeded expectations  
yet again."
"Adjusted EBITDA recorded by this segment totalled €1,578 million, easily 
surpassing the forecast range of €0.3 billion to €0.6 billion."
"We also registered a 
substantial gain compared to the previous year (€1,161 million)."
"One particular factor 
reflected here is that the previous year’s figure was curtailed by the aforementioned 
impairment of €748 million recognised for contracts relating to hard coal purchases  
from Russia."
"•	 Coal / Nuclear: At €705 million, adjusted EBITDA was below the forecast range of 
€0.8 billion to €1.2 billion."
"During the year under review, our lignite-fired power stations 
were faced with less favourable market conditions than anticipated."
"We were therefore 
forced to accept a significant decline in earnings for the portion of generated power that 
had not been hedged in advance."
"This was also one of the reasons we closed fiscal 2023 
down on the previous year’s figure (€751 million)."
"Prolonged planned and unplanned 
outages for maintenance work also came to bear."
"In addition, the Emsland nuclear power 
station only contributed to earnings until it was shut down on 15 April 2023."
"The fact that 
we sell most of our electricity forward at an early stage had a positive impact as these 
margins proved to be higher than in the previous year."
Adjusted EBIT 39 % up year on year.
"The RWE Group’s adjusted EBIT advanced by 
€1,781 million, or 39 %, to €6,349 million."
"We had forecast a figure between €3.6 billion 
and €4.2 billion in March 2023."
"This substantial improvement was driven by the same 
factors as adjusted EBITDA."
"The difference between these two key figures is that  
operating depreciation and amortisation, which totalled €2,029 million (previous year: 
€1,742 million), is included in adjusted EBIT, but not in adjusted EBITDA."
"The 
reconciliation from adjusted EBIT to net income was characterised by a notable increase in 
the non-operating result, which had been weighed down by significant temporary losses 
from the valuation of derivatives the year prior."
"We present the development of the 
reconciliation items below."
The adjusted financial result declined by €78 million to – €495 million.
"The rise in market 
interest rates triggered a number of developments, which largely netted each other out."
"The components of the financial result changed as follows:
•	 Net interest declined by €78 million."
"In part this was because we had to redeem more 
RWE bonds than in the preceding year due to new issuances."
"We were also faced with 
elevated short-term financing costs."
"However, we also achieved higher income on bank 
deposits."
"•	 Burdens on earnings from the interest accretion to non-current provisions rose by 
€316 million."
"In addition to higher interest rates, the larger volume of provisions 
compared to the previous year also came to bear."
•	 The other financial result improved by €316 million.
"In the year under review, we no longer 
had to pay negative interest rates for our bank deposits."
"Furthermore, the return on our 
investments in money market funds increased."
"1	 
Adjusted figure; see commentary on page 41."
"1	 
Adjusted figure; see commentary on page 41."
"Its main items developed as follows: 
•	 The adjustments made to EBIT curtailed earnings by €1,867 million."
"In the prior year, we 
recorded a much more significant loss (– €4,680 million), which could primarily be traced 
back to timing effects on earnings from the valuation of derivatives."
"In the year under 
review, such effects led to income of €1,386 million."
"The result reported in the ‘other’ line 
item dropped to – €3,374 million."
"Impairments recognised for lignite units and opencast 
mines (– €1.1 billion) as well as for our Dutch power plants (– €0.6 billion) played a major 
role."
They were necessary because the market conditions for these activities deteriorated.
"We reversed the write-backs that we had recognised last year when earnings prospects 
looked brighter."
"Increased provisions for impending losses for long-term power purchase 
agreements weighed on earnings."
"Unlike in 2022, we recorded capital gains in the non-
operating result (€121 million)."
"This was due to the sale of RWE Gas Storage CZ, on which 
we report on page 37."
"1	 
Adjusted figure; see commentary on page 41."
"•	 At €19 million, adjustments to the financial result had little impact."
"The previous year’s 
figure was significantly higher due to one-off effects (€1,244 million): an increase in 
discount rates used to calculate mining and nuclear provisions reduced the present value 
of obligations, which had a positive effect on earnings."
"Income before tax amounted to €4,006 million (previous year: €715 million)."
"Taxes on 
income resulted in a charge of €2,409 million after the tax gain of €2,277 million in 2022."
The effective tax rate for 2023 was thus 60 %.
"This figure is significantly higher than the 
budgeted rate of 20 % which we established, having taken account of projected income in 
our markets, local tax rates, and the use of loss carryforwards."
"The discrepancy is due to the 
fact that we wrote off deferred tax assets."
"These are claims for future tax relief resulting 
from differences in the recognition and / or valuation of assets and liabilities between the tax 
and IFRS balance sheets."
"Recognising them is subject to the prerequisite that taxable profits 
arise in future fiscal periods which allow the tax reduction to be used."
"This is currently not 
foreseeable for RWE AG’s tax group."
"The write-downs reversed the write-backs from the 
previous year, when we had expected to be able to utilise the deferred taxes."
"Non-controlling interests declined by €128 million to €147 million, driven mainly by reduced 
after-tax earnings from UK offshore wind farms in which third parties own minority 
shareholdings."
"Our net income, which reflects income attributable to RWE shareholders, amounted to 
€1,450 million, which was markedly down on the previous year (€2,717 million)."
"Adjusted net income came to €4,536 million."
"Due to the unexpectedly positive earnings of our operating activities, it was far above the 
guided range of €2.2 billion to €2.7 billion."
"The prior-year figure of €3,253 million was also 
exceeded."
"To calculate adjusted net income, first we deducted the non-operating result 
from the reconciliation statement."
"Then, instead of applying the actual tax rate we used the 
aforementioned budgeted rate of 20 %."
"Adjusted net income per share totalled €6.10, based on 743.8 million shares."
"The previous 
year’s figure (€4.71) was calculated based on 691.2 million shares as the new shares from 
the conversion of the mandatory convertible bond issued to Qatar Holding on 10 October 
2022 were taken into account on a prorated basis as per IFRS."

"In the past fiscal year, our 
capital spending totalled €9,979 million, which is more than twice as much as in 2022 
(€4,484 million)."
"69 % of the funds were used for our Onshore Wind / Solar segment, 15 % 
went to Offshore Wind and 10 % was allocated to Hydro / Biomass / Gas."
"We spent €5,146 million on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (previous 
year: €3,303 million)."
"Wind and solar projects in Europe and the USA received the bulk of 
these funds."
"The single-largest expenditure item was the construction of the Sofia offshore 
wind farm in the British North Sea."
"We also invested in the establishment of LNG and 
hydrogen infrastructure in Germany."
"Our capex on acquisitions and financial assets was exceptionally high, totalling 
€4,833 million (previous year: €1,181 million)."
"We used the lion’s share of this sum to 
acquire Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses."
"Additional funds were dedicated to financing 
the acquisition of UK solar developer JBM Solar and Dutch gas-fired power plant Magnum."
We have provided information on these transactions on page 35 et seqq.
"In the year under review, 89 % of our capital expenditure was taxonomy-aligned, meaning 
that these funds were spent on projects classified as sustainable according to the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation."
"This proportion was higher than in 2022 (83 %), which was 
attributable to the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses."
"This percentage is 
based on total capital expenditure of €11,997 million."
"The amount differs from the above 
figure (€9,979 million) because non-cash transactions are also taxonomy-relevant and we 
consider the resulting additions to assets rather than associated acquisition expenditure."

Headcount significantly higher thanks to green growth.
"As of 31 December 2023, the 
RWE Group had 20,135 people on its payroll, of which 13,385 were employed in Germany 
and 6,750 worked abroad."
"These figures are full-time equivalents, meaning that part-time 
positions are considered on a pro-rata basis."
"Headcount grew significantly compared to the 
end of 2022, rising by 1,825 full-time equivalents at the Group level and by as many as 
2,164 in the core business."
"The acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses (+ 471) 
played a major role."
"Furthermore, our growth projects created new jobs, above all in the 
renewable energy and hydrogen business."
"The sale of the Czech gas storage business had a 
counteracting effect (– 261)."
"The increase in personnel in the core business was contrasted 
by a decline in the Coal / Nuclear segment (– 339) where our employees accepted partial 
and early retirement offers, many doing so as part of the German coal phaseout."
Personnel figures do not include apprentices.
"At the end of 2023, 707 young people were 
learning a profession at RWE, compared to 742 in the previous year."
RWE has this base covered.
"Our financial needs are largely covered using 
cash flow from operating activities, which totalled €4.2 billion in 2023."
"This was 
notably higher than last year’s level – in part due to our strong earnings."
"These cash 
flows ensure net debt remains at a moderate level, despite significant investment."
"the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA in our core business, 
reached 0.9 in the year under review."
"It remained well below 3.0, which is the upper 
threshold we have set for this key figure."
"Our ambitious growth strategy means that we require significant 
financial resources to be available long term."
"However at times, we also need ­
substantial 
liquidity at short notice, for example as collateral for commodity futures."
"RWE’s most 
important source of financing is our cash flows from operating activities."
"We are also 
financed by debt ­
capital and rely on the following tools to this end:
•	 Our Debt Issuance Programme (DIP) gives us latitude in raising debt capital for the long 
term."
It currently allows us to issue senior bonds with a total face value of up to €10 billion.
"In 2023 and early 2024, we issued bonds totalling €1.5 billion within the framework of 
our DIP."
"By late February 2024, we had used €6.6 billion of our debt issuance headroom."
Our two hybrid bonds are not part of the programme.
"We plan to bolster our DIP to ensure 
long-term access to the necessary debt capital to fund our growth investments."
"•	 We utilise two commercial paper programmes for our short-term financing: one is 
European (ECP) and the other is American (USCP)."
"We have used our US Commercial 
Paper Programme since February 2023."
"Our ECP allows us to raise up to €5 billion in 
funds on the European money market."
"The USCP enables us to source up to US$3 billion 
from investors in the USA."
"During the year under review, the volume of commercial paper 
still outstanding intermittently reached up to €2.7 billion (ECP) and US$1.4 billion (USCP)."
"•	 To secure our liquidity, we can also access three syndicated credit lines totalling 
€10 billion, which are extended by a consortium of 35 international banks."
"The first two 
credit lines, one of €3 billion and one of €2 billion, were secured in 2019 and 2022, 
respectively."
They are due to expire in April 2026.
"The third line of credit was granted in 
July 2023 to give us more financial leeway when securing commodity forward 
transactions."
It has a volume of €5 billion and is due to expire after a year.
"However, we 
reserve the right to extend its term twice by six months per extension."
"At our request, the 
conditions of all three credit lines are linked to sustainability criteria."
"Among other things, 
the conditions depend on the development of the following three indicators: the share of 
renewables in RWE’s generation portfolio, the CO2 intensity of our plants and the 
percentage of our capex that is classified as sustainable in accordance with the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation."
We have set goals for all three of these criteria.
"If we do not achieve 
them, we would be required to pay higher interest and commitment fees."
"Half of the 
additional expenses would be directed to non-profit organisations."
"This was largely due to significant spending on property, plant, equipment, 
financial assets and acquisitions."
"Proceeds from sales of securities, however, helped 
partially offset these sums."
"Our financing activities also gave rise to liquidity outflows, namely in the amount of 
€1,557 million (previous year: inflows of €8,615 billion), partially due to our decision to 
settle a large portion of our short-term bank debt and commercial paper."
"Dividend 
payments to RWE shareholders and minority shareholders came to €943 million  
(previous year: €913 million)."
"Conversely, we saw significant inflows from initial margins  
and collaterals."
"Unlike variation margins, these sureties are reported in cash flows from 
financing activities."
"The two €0.5 billion green bonds we issued in February 2023 also 
improved cash flow."
"On balance, the aforementioned cash flows from operating, investing and financing 
activities decreased our cash and cash equivalents by €71 million."
"Cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditure, plus proceeds from 
divestments and asset disposals, results in free cash flow."
"This indicator dropped by 
€2,614 million to – €4,582 million."
"At €4.2 billion, operating cash flow significantly higher than last year."
"Cash flows from 
operating activities are the RWE Group’s most important source of finance."
"This item 
amounted to €4,235 million in 2023, which was significantly higher than last year 
(€2,406 million)."
The increase was partly attributable to improved operational earnings.
"In addition, we paid much lower variation margins for commodity derivatives compared to 
2022."
"These margins are sureties for exchange-traded futures contracts pledged during 
the term of the contracts."
"Cash 
flow also increased in December 2023 when the German government paid the first 
instalments of our compensation for the lignite phaseout."
"However, we saw significant 
counteractive effects from the rising cost of CO2 emissions certificates."
"In the consolidated financial statements as at 
31 December 2023, we report net debt of €6,587 million, having recorded net cash in the 
amount of €1,630 million at the end of 2022."
"This change is largely attributable to the 
acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses."
"In all, investments in property, plant and 
equipment (€5.1 billion) and dividend payments (€0.9 billion) were higher than operating 
cash inflows, which had a debt-increasing effect."
Pension provisions also increased.
Leverage factor of 0.9 significantly below our set cap.
"One of our key management 
parameters is the ratio of net debt to the adjusted EBITDA of the core business, also referred 
to as the leverage factor."
"We set the upper limit for the leverage factor at 3.0 in order to 
secure our financial flexibility."
"On the balance-sheet date, this indicator stood at 0.9, i."
significantly below this upper threshold.
"However, in future our debt ratio is likely to be higher, 
above all due to growth investments in our green core business, which we will finance using 
debt capital."
Notably reduced off-balance-sheet obligations from fuel purchases.
"Net debt does not 
include our off-balance-sheet obligations, which largely stem from long-term purchase 
agreements for commodities."
"As of the balance-sheet date, our payment obligations from 
key fuel procurement contracts amounted to €3.9 billion (previous year: €4.5 billion)."
"In 
relation to electricity procurement, they totalled €5.6 billion (previous year: €7.2 billion)."
"The 
figures are based on assumptions regarding the prospective development of commodity 
prices."
"Our contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment 
amounted to €8.1 billion compared to €5.7 billion last year."
"Further off-balance-sheet 
obligations result, inter alia, from liabilities for pension commitments that employees of our 
former subsidiary innogy had earned up to its IPO in 2016."
"1	 
Mining provisions are not included in net debt."
The same holds true for the assets which we attribute to them.
"
At present, this includes our 15 % stake in E.ON and the portion of our claim for state compensation for the German 
lignite ­
phaseout which has not yet been settled."
"In the 2023 consolidated financial statements, 
we reported total assets of €106.5 billion compared to €138.5 billion in last year’s financial 
statements."
"This change was largely driven by the decline in the value of commodity 
derivatives: they fell by €25.3 billion to €23.3 billion on the assets side of the balance sheet 
and by €35.2 billion to €17.1 billion on the equity and liabilities side."
"In addition, our 
marketable securities portfolio decreased by €5.7 billion."
"Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment conversely grew by €9.2 billion, which 
was in part due to the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses."
"Equity increased 
by €3.9 billion to €33.1 billion."
"Its share in the balance sheet total (equity ratio) was 31.1 % 
and thus 10.0 percentage points higher than at the end of the previous year."
"RWE AG prepares its 
financial statements in compliance with the rules set out in the German Commercial Code 
and the German Stock Corporation Act."
"The financial statements are submitted to 
Bundesanzeiger Verlag GmbH, located in Cologne, Germany, which publishes them in the 
Company Register."
They can also be downloaded from www.rwe.com/financial-reports.
"RWE’s annual financial statements dated 31 December 2023 record €63.8 billion 
in total assets (previous year: €59.2 billion)."
"The increase is largely attributable to the rise 
registered by accounts receivable and payable to affiliated companies."
"However, there were  
also factors that weighed on total assets: on the assets side of the balance sheet, marketable 
securities and cash and cash equivalents dropped, as did commercial paper and accounts 
payable to credit institutes on the equity and liabilities side."
"RWE AG’s equity amounted to 
€12.1 billion, registering a rise of €3.0 billion over the previous year’s figure."
"Its share of total 
assets rose by 3.7 percent to 19.0 %."
"This was largely due to the increase in capital due to the 
issuance of the mandatory convertible bond to Qatar Holding in 2022."
"The bond had already 
been reported with an equity-raising effect in the IFRS consolidated financial statements upon 
issue."
"However, in accordance with German commercial law, this was only possible for the 
financial statements once the bond had been converted into RWE shares in 2023."
"At €1.3 billion, RWE AG’s net profit for the past year remained largely unchanged 
compared to 2022."
Profit transfers by the subsidiaries increased significantly.
"However, 
a write-back we reported last year did not recur, which had a dampening effect."
"Distributable profit amounted to €744 million, which corresponds to the ­
intended 
distribution to RWE shareholders: we plan to propose a dividend of €1.00 per share to 
the Annual General Meeting taking place in May 2024."
"RWE AG has a solid economic position with high levels of cash and cash 
equivalents and a number of financing tools at its disposal that it can use flexibly."
"Our long-
term credit ratings from Moody’s (Baa2) and Fitch (BBB+) are classified as investment 
grade."
"Last year, both these rating agencies reaffirmed their positive assessments."
"Detailed 
information on RWE’s financial situation is available on page 54 et seqq."
"RWE AG’s earnings position remains largely unchanged compared to 
2022."
"The individual items on the income statement developed as follows:
•	 Income from financial assets rose by €190 million to €1,392 million."
"The main 
contributing factor here was the exceptional performance of RWE Supply & Trading."
RWE Nuclear also contributed to earnings following a weak 2022.
"Conversely, RWE Power 
and RWE Generation closed the year with a loss."
"Earnings were also impacted by the fact 
that the positive effect of significant write-backs we recognised in 2022 for RWE Power 
did not recur in 2023."
•	 Net interest improved by €447 million to – €356 million.
"This was in part due to a rise in 
capital gains from the management of fund assets used to cover our pension obligations."
"•	 Other income and expenses amounted to – €3 million, falling significantly short of last 
year’s figure (€818 million) which had been exceptionally high due to write-backs 
recognised for receivables against a subsidiary."
"•	 The presented earnings figures and tax income of €252 million (previous year: €118 million) 
result in a net profit of €1,285 million."
This is €50 million less than in 2022.
•	 Distributable profit came to €744 million.
"This figure corresponds to the intended 
payment of a dividend of €1.00 per share to our shareholders."
"RWE AG’s earnings position in the current fiscal year will largely depend 
on the business performance of its subsidiaries."
"Our current assessment makes us 
confident that net profit in 2024 will provide the necessary headroom for the intended 
dividend of €1.10 per share."
"Corporate governance declaration in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of  
the German Commercial Code."
"On 15 February 2024, the Executive Board and the 
Supervisory Board of RWE AG issued its Corporate Governance Declaration in accordance 
with Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code."
"The declaration contains 
the Corporate Governance Report and has been published at www.rwe.com/corporate-
governance-declaration."
We communicated our guidance at a Capital Markets Day last November.
"This 
forecast remains unchanged."
"It envisages adjusted EBITDA of the core business within 
a range of €5.2 billion to €5.8 billion."
"Due to the recent significant drop in prices on the 
wholesale electricity market, we currently expect a figure at the lower end of the range."
"The same applies to adjusted net income of the core business, which we anticipate will 
amount to between €1.9 billion and €2.4 billion."
"Income from energy trading and the 
commercial optimisation of power plant dispatch is likely to come in clearly below  
the high level recorded in 2023."
"Conversely, we anticipate positive stimulus from the 
commissioning of new wind and solar farms."
Subdued economic prospects in RWE’s core markets.
"Economic developments in our 
markets remain overshadowed by geopolitical uncertainty."
"Moreover, high rates of inflation 
limit latitude to loosen monetary policy."
"The German Council of Economic Experts (GCEE) 
forecasts global growth of some 2 % for the year underway (source: Annual Report 
2023 / 2024 of the GCEE)."
"Based on this assessment, Germany’s gross domestic product 
will rise by a mere 0.7 %."
"The Council expects the UK economy to expand by about 0.5 %, with 
the Netherlands registering about 1 % growth."
"The outlook for the United States of America 
is slightly more favourable, as the Council predicts the country posting a gain of 1.5 %."
Electricity demand expected to recover.
"Our expectations regarding this year’s electricity 
consumption are based on the economic outlook set out above among other things."
"Demand for electricity in our core markets Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands 
and the USA should trend back upward slightly after the declines witnessed last year."
Adjustment in reporting on phaseout technologies.
"We changed the way we report on  
our coal and nuclear business with effect from 1 January 2024."
"Moving forward, we will no 
longer assign earnings from these activities to adjusted EBITDA, but to the non-operating 
result."
"The Coal / Nuclear segment, in which these activities are pooled, has been renamed 
‘Phaseout Technologies’."
"It no longer includes RWE’s stakes in URANIT (50 %) and Dutch 
nuclear power plant operator EPZ (30 %)."
"We have allocated the former to ‘Other, 
consolidation’ and the latter to the Hydro / Biomass / Gas segment, which has been renamed 
‘Flexible Generation’."
"The change in reporting reflects the way in which we manage the 
phaseout technologies, which is largely based on operational cash flows less capital 
expenditure."
"We will present the financial development of these technologies based on 
adjusted cash flow going forward."
"To ensure comparability, we will also apply the new 
method to figures from the previous year in our 2024 financial reporting."
November 2023 earnings forecast will probably just be met.
"Over the current fiscal year, 
our operating result will most likely remain far below the high level recorded in 2023."
"We 
forecast €5.2 billion to €5.8 billion for adjusted EBITDA in the core business on the Capital 
Markets Day on 28 November 2023."
"However, we expect this figure to 
close the year at the lower end of the guidance."
"This is because power prices have dropped 
considerably in the last few months."
"In November 2023, we envisaged adjusted EBIT in our 
core business to come in between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion."
"Here, too, we anticipate a 
figure at the lower end of the range."
The same applies to adjusted net income.
"Here the 
range is €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion."
"The decline in earnings compared to 2023 is based on 
the expectation that the trading performance, generation margins and income from the 
commercial optimisation of power plant dispatch will fall short of the high levels achieved 
last year."
"We expect positive effects from the commissioning of new wind farms, solar parks 
and battery storage solutions."
"We believe a figure in the lower half is highly likely, owing to 
the recent development of electricity prices."
This would represent a decline year on year.
"The main contributing factors are lower realised prices for volumes that were sold on the 
electricity forward market."
"•	 Onshore Wind / Solar: We expect adjusted EBITDA in this segment to close the year 
between €1.5 billion and €1.9 billion."
"As some of our generation in this segment will also 
be impacted by the subdued market prices, we believe a figure in the lower half of the 
range is highly likely."
"Nevertheless, this would represent a substantial gain year on year."
"We 
expect positive effects from the commissioning of new generation assets."
"In addition, the 
activities of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, which we acquired as of 1 March 2023, 
will contribute a full twelve months of earnings for the first time."
"•	 Flexible Generation: We expect the renamed segment, which encompasses the 
Hydro / Biomass / Gas activities and the 30 % shareholding in EPZ, to post adjusted 
EBITDA at the lower end of the forecast range of €1.8 billion to €2.2 billion."
"This would 
represent a significant decline in earnings compared to 2023."
"The main reasons for this 
are lower realised margins on electricity forward sales and reduced income from the 
commercial optimisation of power plant dispatch."
"However, we will receive slightly higher 
payments under the British capacity market scheme."
"•	 Supply & Trading: Assuming a normal business trend, adjusted EBITDA should total 
between €0.1 billion and €0.5 billion, falling far short of last year’s very high level."
"Phaseout Technologies: As set out on page 60, we manage our coal and nuclear activities 
based on adjusted cash flow."
"This figure is calculated by deducting net capital expenditure 
from operating cash flows."
"We expect Phaseout Technologies to achieve adjusted cash flow 
of between €0.3 billion and €0.6 billion in 2024."
"The pro-forma figure for the previous year 
was €117 million."
"Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment much higher year on year."
"We 
intend to increase our capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets significantly compared to 2023 (€5,146 million)."
"Our main areas of investment are 
wind, solar and battery projects in Europe and the USA."
"Substantial funds have been 
earmarked for the construction of the Sofia (United Kingdom) and Thor (Denmark) wind 
farms in the North Sea."
Leverage factor likely to be well below the 3.0 cap.
"The ratio of net debt to adjusted 
EBITDA of the core business (leverage factor) was 0.9 in 2023, clearly below the ceiling of 
3.0 which we established for this key performance indicator."
"The factor is likely to increase in 
2024 due to our significant growth investments."
"However, it is expected to remain well 
below the aforementioned cap."
Dividend for fiscal 2024.
"The Executive Board of RWE AG envisages a dividend of €1.10 
per share for fiscal 2024."
"This represents an increase of €0.10 compared to the dividend 
proposed for 2023."

Development of risks and opportunities
Distribution of risk management tasks."
"Responsibility for risk and opportunity 
management within the Group lies with the parent company RWE AG."
"Its Executive Board 
monitors and manages the Group’s overall risk."
"In addition, it determines the general risk 
appetite of RWE and defines upper limits for single risk positions."
"At the level below the 
Executive Board, the Controlling & Risk Management department has the task of applying 
and constantly refining the risk management system."
"It derives detailed limits for the 
individual business fields and operating units from the risk thresholds set by the Executive 
Board."
"Its tasks also include checking that the risks have been identified in full and are 
plausible before aggregating them."
"In so doing, it receives support from the Risk 
Management Committee, which is composed of the heads of the following five RWE AG 
departments: (1) Controlling & Risk Management (Chair), (2) Finance & Credit Risk, 
(3) Accounting, (4) Legal, Compliance & Insurance, and (5) Strategy & Sustainability."
"The 
Controlling & Risk Management department provides the Executive Board and the 
Supervisory Board of RWE AG with regular reports on the company’s risk exposure."
"A number of additional organisational units and committees have been entrusted with risk 
management tasks: 
•	 The Group’s financial and credit risks are managed by the Finance & Credit Risk 
department of RWE AG."
•	 Accounting ensures that financial reporting is free of material misstatements.
"It uses the 
aforementioned accounting-related internal control system for this purpose."
"A committee 
consisting of officers from Accounting and other departments relevant to accounting 
assists in securing the quality of our financial reporting."
"The risk situation of RWE is largely defined by potential changes to the regulatory 
context."
"The future development of energy prices is also of great importance to our 
business, particularly the recent sharp drop in wholesale market prices."
"Companies 
such as RWE need to recognise their various risks and prepare for them."
"We do so with 
the help of a professional control and risk management system, which we will elaborate 
on in the following chapter."
RWE’s control and risk management system.
"Our internal control and risk management 
system provides a solid methodological basis for the early detection, assessment and 
management of business-related risks."
It also helps us identify and leverage opportunities.
"Our analyses and actions primarily relate to events that impact the success of our business, 
while also taking sustainability matters of material relevance to us into consideration."
"To 
ensure our financial reporting is accurate and reliable, we use an accounting-related 
internal control system (see pages 70 et seq.)."
"We also rely on a compliance management 
system (CMS), designed to ensure compliance with the regulations and standards 
applicable to RWE (see page 71)."
"Internal Audit regularly verifies the quality and functionality of our control and risk 
management system."
"Such assessments were again carried out in 2023 and gave no 
cause to doubt the appropriateness and effectiveness of our control and risk management 
system."
"The Executive Board of RWE AG confirmed the Group’s risk bearing capacity by way 
of a resolution dated 24 November 2023."
"We also employ Group 
compliance officers, who dedicate their time to ensuring Group-wide rules and 
regulations are implemented uniformly."
•	 Risks from changes in commodity prices are monitored by RWE Supply & Trading.
"This 
company not only manages these risks in relation to energy trading but also with regard 
to electricity generation and our gas business."
"•	 The Commodity Strategy Group is responsible for the strategic management of the 
commodity positions we take in relation to our power generation activities."
"RWE AG is 
represented by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Head of 
Controlling & Risk Management."
"The managing directors of RWE Supply & Trading are also 
represented in the committee."
"•	 The Commodity Management Committee is responsible for implementing the risk 
management strategies developed by the aforementioned committee."
"This expert panel 
consists of the Chief Financial Officer of RWE AG, the managing directors of 
RWE Supply & Trading and a representative of the Controlling & Risk Management 
department."
"•	 Risks relating to data confidentiality, integrity and availability (information security) and 
the security of IT systems are overseen by the Group Cyber Security department of 
RWE AG."
"It analyses risk exposure and sees to it that our Group companies implement 
necessary safeguards."
"Under the expert management of the aforementioned organisational units, RWE AG and  
its subsidiaries are responsible for identifying risks early, assessing them correctly and 
managing them in accordance with corporate standards."
Risk identification and assessment.
"Risks and opportunities are defined as negative or 
positive deviations from expected figures."
"Their management is an integral and continuous 
part of our operating processes."
"We assess risks every six months, using a bottom-up 
analysis."
We also monitor risk exposure between the regular survey dates.
"The Executive 
Board of RWE AG is immediately notified of any material changes."
"The executive and 
supervisory bodies are updated on the Group’s risks once a quarter."
"Our risk analysis normally covers the three-year horizon of our medium-term plan, but can 
extend beyond that in individual cases."
"We measure the potential damage based on the 
possible effects on net income, liquidity, net debt and equity."
"The key indicator which is most 
impacted determines the risk classification, taking hedges into account."
We display the material risks using a matrix (see next page).
"They are categorised by 
potential damage and probability of occurrence."
"Where possible, we aggregate risks that 
share the same cause to one single risk."
"To clearly assign them to the matrix fields, we have 
established damage potential thresholds, which are oriented towards the RWE Group’s 
ability to bear risks."
They are presented in the table below the matrix.
"Depending on their 
position in the matrix, we distinguish between low, medium and high risks."
"Through this 
systematic risk identification, we determine whether there is a need for action and – if so – 
initiate measures to mitigate the risks."

Development of risks  
and opportunities
Main risks for the ­
RWE Group."
"Depending on their causes, our risks can be divided into 
seven classes, which are shown in the table above."
"The highest individual risk determines the 
classification of the risk of the entire risk class."
"Our classification reflects the situation in 
February 2024."
"The assessment has remained unchanged since March last year, as 
presented in the 2022 Annual Report on page 67 et seqq."
"Market risks along with regulatory and political risks continue to be the only classes which 
we have classified as ‘high’."
"We currently see ourselves particularly exposed to political 
uncertainties resulting from the upcoming elections in Europe and the USA."
"Depending on 
the outcome, both regions could yet review their energy and climate policies."
"This would 
have an impact on our business and our investment plans, in particular."
"Our most apparent 
market risks pertain to the development of wholesale electricity prices."
"Most recently, 
wholesale quotations were in significant decline."
"We have therefore had to carry out 
downward revaluations on the margin forecasts of a portion our generation portfolio."
"If prices continue to stagnate, we expect this to further weigh on the business."
1	 Aggregated over the planning horizon.
"We will also explain the 
measures we take to counter the threat of negative developments."
"In most of the countries in which we are active, the energy sector is 
characterised by the free formation of prices."
"This gives rise to opportunities as well as 
risks."
"The supply situation in Europe has relaxed despite the considerable reduction in 
Russian fuel imports."
"Quotations on our most important European electricity markets 
have therefore fallen significantly short of the record highs seen in 2022."
"Weak economic 
growth caused energy prices to drop further than we had anticipated."
"Margins realised for 
a portion of our generation portfolio in 2024 have therefore been lower than anticipated."
"If electricity prices stagnate at a low level, this would further dampen our earnings 
prospects, particularly for the coming years."
"This would not only affect power stations, but 
would also impact renewable assets which generate electricity that is then sold at market 
conditions."
"However, there is also a chance that the economy will recover, pushing 
electricity prices up."
"We assess the price risks to which we are exposed on the markets taking account of 
current forward prices and expected volatility."
"For our power plants and parts of our 
renewable energy portfolio, we limit the earnings risks by hedging a significant portion of 
the electricity."
"We also secure the prices of fuel and CO2 emission allowances needed to 
produce power."
"However, by selling electricity forward, we run the risk of having to make 
expensive purchases on the market to fulfil supply commitments in the event of 
production outages or non-delivery of fuel."
"In addition, collateralising forward contracts 
can lead to significant temporary cash outflows."
"We address this risk when deciding how 
much power to hedge."
"RWE Supply & Trading plays a central role when it comes to managing commodity  
price risks."
"It functions as the Group’s interface to the global wholesale markets for 
electricity and energy commodities."
"On behalf of our power generation companies, 
RWE Supply & Trading markets large portions of our electricity output and purchases the 
necessary fuels and CO2 certificates."
"In compliance with risk thresholds, the company also 
takes commodity positions to achieve a profit."
"Our risk management system for energy trading is aligned with the best practice 
standards as applied to the trading businesses of banks."
"As part of this, we only conclude 
transactions if the associated risks are within approved limits."
"Our commodity positions 
are constantly monitored."
"Risks from trades conducted by RWE Supply & Trading for its 
own account are monitored daily."
The Value at Risk (VaR) is of central importance for risk measurement in trading.
"It 
specifies the maximum loss from a risk position not exceeded with a given probability over 
a certain planning horizon."
"In the Group we generally base our VaR figures on a 
confidence interval of 95 % – with a holding period of one day."
"This means that, with a 
probability of 95 %, the daily loss will not exceed the VaR."
"The VaR for the price risks of 
commodity positions in the trading business must adhere to a €60 million ceiling."
"In the 
year under review, the actual daily figures were usually significantly lower."
"They averaged 
€16 million."
"In addition, limits derived from the VaR thresholds have been set for each individual 
trading desk."
"Furthermore, we develop extreme scenarios and factor them into stress 
tests, determine their consequences for earnings and take countermeasures if we deem 
the risks to be too high."
"These activities are also subject to a daily 
VaR cap, which is set at €40 million."
The actual average VaR for 2023 was €13 million.
We also use financial instruments to hedge our commodity positions.
"In the consolidated 
financial statements, we present these instruments, inter alia, through the statement of 
on-balance-sheet hedges."
"We take the same approach to financial instruments serving 
the purpose of limiting interest rate and currency risks."
"More detailed information on this 
can be found on pages 139 and 192 et seqq."
•	 Regulatory and political risks.
"Most countries in which we are active have set their sights 
on ambitious climate protection goals."
"Having designed our business model around the 
energy transition, our company is now able to leverage a range of opportunities for 
growth."
We are cutting our CO2 emissions whilst contributing to security of supply.
"By 
doing so, we ensure that regulatory intervention to improve climate protection does not 
disrupt our business."
"Despite the growing proportion of carbon-free and low-carbon technologies in our 
generation portfolio, we see ourselves exposed to a range of regulatory and political risks."
"These result, not least, from our ambitious growth plans."
"Projects we are planning to 
invest in could become less attractive if the regulatory framework were to deteriorate."
"We would then possibly have to put these projects on hold and write off any investments 
already made."
"The upcoming elections in the EU, the UK and the USA could trigger a 
redesign of energy and climate policy in these regions."
"It is possible that the framework for 
the delivery of our growth strategy could worsen."
"However, there is also a chance that 
politicians continue to expand on the regulatory framework for green investments, 
making it more attractive."
"One example is the planned European electricity market 
reform, which is designed to drive renewables expansion and help the EU become 
independent of Russian fuel imports (see page 30)."
"One focal point of the reform is to 
promote the use of contracts for difference or capacity payments, which make the 
earnings for environmentally friendly generation technologies more predictable."
"The fact that Brussels’ electricity market reform leaves no room for a reintroduction of the 
extraordinary levy on electricity generators’ revenues and will not change the market 
design is encouraging."
"Fears that the EU could curtail or revoke the price formation 
mechanism on the electricity market have proven to be unfounded."
"This has reduced our 
risk exposure."
"One significant barrier to the creation of a green energy infrastructure can prove to be 
political limitations on international supply chains."
"Examples include the USA’s anti-
dumping levies and bans, which complicate or block solar module imports from Asia."
"We therefore take particular care when selecting our suppliers and are focusing on 
identifying local sources."
"Our 2022 agreement with the Federal government and the state of North Rhine-
Westphalia to bring our exit from lignite forward to 2030 has given us planning security 
for the future in this part of our business."
"As set out on page 39, the European 
Commission approved €2.6 billion in compensation in December 2023 which we are 
legally and contractually entitled to for the coal phaseout."
"The only outstanding risks 
relate to possible claims being filed, which in our view would be factually unfounded."
"We 
are also entitled to compensation in the Netherlands."
"In September 2023 it was set at 
€332 million by the government, but is still pending the green light from the EU."
"It will be 
paid to us for a statutory limitation on electricity generation from hard coal in the first half 
of 2022, which was abolished early due to the Ukraine crisis (see page 39)."
"Economic sanctions, similar to those in place 
against Russia, can also restrict trade."
"Major losses can result from our failure to honour 
contracts."
"Furthermore, we have to be prepared for our contractual parties making claims 
for damages and our becoming involved in litigation."
"Dismantling decommissioned power stations is also associated with regulatory risks, 
particularly in relation to nuclear energy."
"Stricter legal or regulatory requirements can lead 
to unexpectedly high expenditure."
"There is also potential to make better progress than 
expected and to achieve cost savings."
"The present regulatory environment also exposes us to risks, for instance, in relation to 
approvals for constructing and operating production facilities."
"This particularly affects  
our opencast mines, power stations and wind and solar farms."
"The danger here is that 
approvals are granted late or not at all and that granted approvals are withdrawn 
temporarily or permanently."
"Furthermore, delays in the transfer of land that has been 
assigned to us for lignite mining are also possible."
"Individual RWE Group companies are involved in litigation and arbitration 
proceedings due to their operations or M & A transactions."
"Out-of-court claims are 
sometimes filed against some of them."
"Furthermore, Group companies are directly 
involved in various procedures with public authorities or are at least affected by their 
outcomes."
"To the extent necessary, we have accrued provisions for possible losses 
resulting from pending proceedings before ordinary courts and arbitration courts."
We classify our legal risks as low.
"This assessment did not change compared to the 
previous year."
"­
RWE operates technologically complex, interconnected generation 
assets."
"Despite all the precautions taken, damage and outages cannot be entirely 
excluded."
Unplanned downtime can result in significant earnings losses.
"Conversely,  
there is also potential for additional earnings, if plant availability is better than expected."
"To mitigate risks, we ensure that our power supply commitments are not too high, as we 
may be forced to buy electricity at a high cost to meet these obligations in the case of 
production outages."
"Furthermore, we regularly maintain our facilities and take out 
insurance policies if economically viable."
Utilisation of our wind and solar farms primarily depends on weather conditions.
"Longer 
periods of low wind, cloud coverage or darkness can cause generation volumes and 
revenue in individual years to remain below estimates."
"We minimise the impact of weather 
conditions on Group earnings by dispersing our green assets geographically."
"This helps us 
to at least partially compensate for less favourable meteorological conditions at one 
location with more favourable weather at another."
"We also benefit from operating our 
flexible power plants, as market conditions for these assets tend to be more favourable 
during periods when wind and solar power feed-ins are low."
"When production facilities are built and modernised, delays can occur, for example due to 
time-consuming approval processes, logistical bottlenecks, delayed or inadequate 
performance by suppliers, and supply chain disruptions due to global trade conflicts."
Project costs can then be higher than anticipated.
"With the help of circumspect planning 
and diligent project management, we do everything within our power to deliver projects 
within the expected time frames."

Development of risks  
and opportunities
RWE has ambitious growth targets."
"When making investment decisions, we take care to 
ensure that our return requirements are satisfied."
"However, there is a chance that actual 
project earnings deviate from our forecasts."
"These risks and opportunities also play a part 
in acquisitions, where the purchase price can prove to have been too high or too low."
"We 
prepare our investment decisions diligently."
"In doing so, we lean on comprehensive 
analyses, which portray the financial and strategic impact of these projects as realistically 
as possible."
"RWE also has differentiated responsibility regulations and approval channels, 
which are to be observed when preparing and actioning investment decisions."
Our business processes are supported by secure data processing systems.
"However, 
cyber attacks are always possible."
"If these attacks prove successful, they could severely 
impact the functioning of our systems and jeopardise confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of RWE data."
"We limit this risk with high security standards and group-wide 
cyber security training programmes."
"In addition, we regularly invest in hardware and 
software upgrades as well as the optimisation of our processes."
"As in the previous year, we classify our operational risks as ‘medium’."
"Interest rates, foreign exchange rates, securities prices and rates of 
inflation are subject to fluctuations, which can be difficult to predict and can have a major 
impact on our net worth and earnings."
Changes in interest rates give rise to risks and opportunities in several respects.
"Market 
interest rates, for example, can impact our provisions, as they are the point of reference 
for the discount rates used for determining the net present values of obligations."
"This 
means that, all other things being equal, provisions decrease when market interest rates 
rise and increase when market interest rates fall."
"of the Notes, we 
present the effects of changes in interest rates on the net present values of our pension 
obligations and on nuclear and mining provisions."
Financing costs rise and fall in line with interest rates.
"We measure the possible impact 
using the Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR), applying a confidence level of 95 % and a holding 
period of one year."
The average CFaR at RWE AG in 2023 was €95 million.
"Rises in market interest rates can lead to reductions in the prices of the securities we hold 
and vice versa."
This primarily relates to fixed-interest bonds.
"We measure this relationship 
using sensitivity analyses."
"As of the balance-sheet date, an increase in market interest 
rates of 100 basis points would have lowered the value of the bonds on our books by 
€22 million."
"We are also exposed to price risks in relation to our 15 % stake in E.ON, which had a fair 
value of €4.8 billion at the end of 2023."
"Security price fluctuations not only have an impact on RWE’s financial assets but also on 
pension funds."
"In the case of unfavourable capital market developments, we might have 
to increase our pension provisions in order to compensate for our fund assets losing 
value."
"Conversely, favourable developments would allow us to reduce these provisions."
"We control risks and opportunities from changes in the price of securities with a 
professional fund management system."
"Range of action, responsibilities and controls are 
set out in internal guidelines which the Group companies are obliged to adhere to when 
concluding financial transactions."
"All financial transactions are recorded using special 
software and are monitored by RWE AG."
Foreign exchange risks are also centrally managed by RWE AG.
"We aggregate foreign 
currency payments made and received across all Group companies to net financial 
positions for each currency and hedge the latter almost in full using currency derivatives."

Development of risks  
and opportunities
General price fluctuations also pose risks."
"Investment projects can become more 
expensive during times of high inflation."
"If income streams do not rise in tandem, this 
impacts the returns yield."
"Rising costs in industries which supply products and render 
services for the disposal of nuclear waste and for the recultivation of opencast mines, 
could prompt us to consider upping provisions for future obligations."
"However, inflation 
rates are already comparatively elevated."
"The likelihood of them falling again is therefore 
relatively high."
Cash collateral pledged for forward transactions also harbours a risk.
"The amount of the 
payments depends on the extent to which the contractually agreed prices deviate from 
market quotations as of the respective cut-off date."
"Substantial differences in collateral 
may weigh heavily on our liquidity."
"Thanks to our robust financial position and use of 
financing instruments at our disposal, we have always been able to provide the required 
funds so far."
Failure of or delays to firmly planned divestments expose us to another financial risk.
"Our growth strategy envisages capital expenditure being partly financed through the 
proceeds from divestments, which we raise, for example, by selling stakes in projects."
"Without the necessary funding, we may have to forego attractive projects due to financial 
restrictions."
"The conditions at which we finance our debt capital are in part reliant on the credit  
ratings we receive from independent rating agencies."
"Moody’s and Fitch classify our 
creditworthiness in the investment grade category."
"If our rating deteriorates, we may incur 
additional costs if we have to raise debt capital."
"The liquidity requirement when pledging 
collateral for forward transactions would also likely increase."
"The assessment of our creditworthiness by rating agencies, banks and capital investors 
depends in part on the level of our leverage factor, i."
"the ratio of net debt to the adjusted 
EBITDA of our core business."
"We have determined a cap for this key indicator, which is 
currently set at 3.0, and is expected to be raised to 3.5 after 2025."
"We are optimistic that 
we will be able to adhere to this limit, but cannot rule out the possibility that we may 
temporarily exceed it, for example if significant collateral is needed for commodity 
forward contracts."
We continue to classify our financial risks as ‘medium’.
•	 Creditworthiness of business partners.
"Our business relations with key accounts, 
suppliers, trading partners and financial institutions expose us to credit risks."
"Therefore, 
we track the creditworthiness of our partners closely and assess their credit standing 
based on internal and external ratings, both before and during the business relationship."
"We determine credit limits prior to concluding transactions above a certain size and all 
trading transactions."
"These thresholds are adjusted if necessary, for instance in the event 
of a change in the business partner’s creditworthiness."
"At times, we request cash collateral 
or bank guarantees."
"In the trading and financing business, credit risks and the utilisation of the limits are 
measured daily."
"We agree on collateral when concluding most over-the-counter trading 
transactions."
"Furthermore, we enter into framework agreements, e."
"those of the 
European Federation of Energy Traders."
"For financial derivatives, we make use of the 
German Master Agreement for forward financial transactions or the Master Agreement 
of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association."
"As in the previous year, our risks stemming from the creditworthiness of our business 
partners do not exceed the ‘medium’ category."

"This risk class includes the potential effects of damage to our reputation, 
compliance infringements and criminal acts."
"We continue to classify our other risks as 
‘low’."
RWE’s risks and opportunities – general assessment by management.
"The risk situation 
has remained largely unchanged since March 2023."
"We still consider changes to the 
regulatory framework and market conditions to harbour our greatest risks and 
opportunities."
"Energy and climate policy changes following elections in the EU, the UK and 
the USA could significantly impact the economic viability of green investments."
"A protracted 
period of weak economic growth combined with low electricity prices continues to be our 
greatest market risk."
"This would weigh on the margins of a portion of our generation 
portfolio."
"However, the economy could also recover and push wholesale electricity prices up."
"Geopolitical uncertainties also continue to expose us to risks, in particular due to the 
substantial importance of functioning international supply chains for our investment 
programme."
"One potential consequence of political tensions could be bans on purchasing 
commodities or components from certain regions."
"If this happens, we may have to abandon 
projects and adjust our growth strategy."
"Despite the aforementioned unknowns, there are no identifiable developments that 
jeopardise the continued operation of RWE AG or the RWE Group."
"Thanks to the measures 
we take to safeguard our financial and earning power over the long term and our 
comprehensive controlling and risk management system, we are confident that we can 
manage all emerging risks."
"At the same time, we are establishing the prerequisites for 
ensuring this remains the case in the future."
Accounting-related internal control system – statements in accordance with Sec.
4 of the German Commercial Code.
"Our financial reporting is 
exposed to the risk of misrepresentations that could have a significant influence on the 
decisions made by their addressees."
"This may cause capital investors to invest in a company 
based on incorrect assumptions."
"Capital market law regulations and RWE’s Code of 
Conduct require that we inform the public of our business performance and important 
company-specific events completely, objectively, accurately, clearly and in a timely manner."
We use a series of tools to meet this ambition.
"Examples of this are our IFRS accounting 
regulation and the high minimum standards to which we subject the IT systems used to 
record and process accounting-related data."
"Furthermore, we use an accounting-related 
Internal Control System (ICS) for quality assurance purposes."
"The ICS aims to prevent 
potential errors and misrepresentations that result from non-compliance with accounting 
standards."
"The Accounting department of RWE AG is responsible for designing the ICS and reviewing 
its effectiveness."
"In doing so, it applies groupwide rules."
"In addition, it receives assistance 
from the ICS Committee, which ensures that the ICS is applied throughout the Group 
following uniform principles and meets high ambitions in terms of correctness and 
transparency."
"The Committee consists of representatives from the Accounting, 
Controlling & Risk Management and Internal Audit & Security Departments, along with 
officers from functions which are closely related to accounting: human resources, 
procurement, trading, finance, tax and IT."

We subject the ICS to a comprehensive review every year."
"First, we examine whether the risk 
situation is presented appropriately and whether suitable controls are in place for the 
­
identified risks."
"Then, we test the effectiveness of the controls."
"ICS reviews that pertain to 
accounting-related processes, for example to the preparation of financial statements or to 
consolidation matters, are conducted by the Accounting department."
"When it comes to 
processes handled by service centres on our behalf, for example invoice ­
processing, an 
auditor certifies the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls."
"The representatives 
of the finance, human resources, procurement, trading and IT functions document whether 
the agreed ICS quality standards are adhered to by their respective areas."
"Our Internal 
Audit & Security department provides assistance for the ICS reviews."
"The results of the 
reviews are documented in a report to the Executive Board of RWE AG."
"The review 
conducted in 2023 once again demonstrated that the ICS is effective."
"When in session, the 
­
Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee regularly concerns itself with the effectiveness of the 
ICS."
"Once a year, the Executive Board of RWE AG submits a report on this to the Committee."
Notes on the compliance management system.
"The RWE Group operates a compliance 
management system (CMS), which is designed to ensure observance of legal provisions and 
compliance with company-specific guidelines and requirements."
"The purpose of the CMS is 
to enshrine compliance as a core value, solidifying it in the thoughts and actions of our staff 
and thereby avoiding potential misconduct."
"We pay particular attention to identifying and 
avoiding the risk of corruption."
"Our catalogue of measures comprises consultations on 
individual cases and training courses."
"We regularly carry out compliance-related risk 
analyses."
"Our employees can also use a whistleblower system – where they can choose to 
remain anonymous – to notify compliance officers if they witness violations or activity that 
could damage the business."
More information on the CMS is available on page 88 et seqq.
"Executive Board members are appointed and dismissed in accordance 
with Section 84 et seq."
"of the German Stock Corporation Act in conjunction with Section 31 
of the German Co-Determination Act."
"Amendments to the Articles of incorporation are 
made pursuant to Section 179 et seqq."
"of the German Stock Corporation Act in conjunction 
with Article 16 Paragraph 5 of the Articles of Incorporation of RWE AG."
"Pursuant to Article 10, 
Paragraph 9 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Supervisory Board is authorised to pass 
resolutions in favour of amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that only concern 
formal matters, without having a material impact on the content."
Executive Board authorisation to implement issuances and buybacks of RWE shares.
"The mandatory convertible bond issued to Qatar Holding was supported by an 
authorisation passed by the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2021 concerning the 
issuance of bearer convertible and / or option bonds."
"This authorisation was largely 
exhausted with the issuance of the mandatory convertible bond."
"The Annual General 
Meeting on 4 May 2023 cancelled the remaining authorisation."
"The Annual General Meeting conditionally increased the capital stock by up to 
€190,423,349.76 (conditional capital), divided into up to 74,384,121 bearer shares, in 
order for the holders of convertible or option rights to be issued shares in the company."
"The following disclosures are in accordance with sections 315a and 289a of the 
German Commercial Code as well as with Section 176, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of  
the German Stock Corporation Act."
"They relate to company-specific regulations, for 
example regarding adjustments to the capital structure by the Executive Board or  
a change of control of the company."
"At RWE, these provisions are in line with the 
standards of German listed companies."
"RWE AG’s capital stock amounts to €1,904,233,515.52."
"It is divided 
among 743,841,217 no-par-value bearer shares."
"This includes 67,621,169 new shares 
that were issued in March 2023 following the conversion of a mandatory convertible bond 
provided to Qatar Holding in October 2022."
Limitation of voting rights or share transfers and employee share schemes.
"One share 
grants one vote at the Annual General Meeting and determines the proportion of the 
company’s profit to which the shareholder is entitled."
"This does not apply to RWE AG’s 
treasury stock which does not confer any rights to the company."
"Voting rights are excluded 
by law in cases where Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act applies."
"Shares that the company issues within the scope of an employee share plan are generally 
subject to a restriction on disposal."
"Usually, the shares may only be sold after a set period."
"RWE shares that are acquired by Executive Board members as part of their contractual 
investment obligation are also subject to minimum holding periods."
"Shares in capital accounting for more than 10 % of voting rights and special rights  
with control powers."
"As of 31 December 2023, no holding in RWE AG exceeded 10 % of  
the voting rights."
There are no RWE shares with special rights that confer control powers.
"On 4 May 2023, 
the Annual General Meeting therefore renewed this authorisation granted by the Annual 
General Meeting on 28 April 2021."
"The new authorisation enables the Executive Board to 
increase the company’s capital stock, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, by 
up to €380,846,702.08 through the issuance of up to 148,768,243 shares (authorised 
capital)."
The authorisation shall remain effective until 3 May 2028.
"New shares from authorised capital and the aforementioned bonds may be issued in 
exchange for contributions in cash or in kind."
"These shares must generally be tendered to 
the shareholders for subscription."
"In sum, shares issued with a waiver of subscription rights from authorised capital or in 
connection with convertible or option bonds may not exceed 10 % of the capital stock."
"The 
aforementioned upper limit is defined by the amount of capital stock at the time the 
­
resolution providing the authorisation was adopted or when the authorisation is exercised,  
if the capital stock is lower at that time."
"Other measures taken waiving subscription rights 
count towards the upper limit."
"At the Executive 
Board’s discretion, the purchase can be made on the stock exchange or via a public offer."
Shares acquired in this manner may be used for all purposes described in the authorisation.
"Shareholder subscription rights may be waived depending on the purpose for which the 
shares are used."
Effects of a change of control on financing instruments.
"Our debt financing instruments 
often contain clauses that take effect in the event of a change of control."
"Such provisions 
are in place e."
"in respect of our €10 billion in syndicated credit lines, requiring drawings to 
be suspended until further notice."
"The lenders shall enter into negotiations with us on a 
continuation of the respective credit line."
"The time limit for doing this is 30 days from the 
notification of the change of control."
"On expiry of the time limit, lenders who are not satisfied 
with the outcome of the negotiations may revoke their loan commitment or cancel the loan 
if it has already been paid out, and request immediate repayment."
"The RWE bonds that we have placed publicly since 2021 are also subject to change-of-
control clauses."
"In the event that a change of control is announced or implemented, 
­
investors may request that their bonds be redeemed by a certain deadline, if RWE’s ­
long-
term credit rating falls below investment grade due to the change of control or if the rating 
agencies stop issuing us a credit rating."
"A similar rule applies to the senior bond that 
matures in 2037, a small portion of which remains on our books as it could not be fully 
transferred to innogy, an RWE subsidiary we have since sold, in 2016."
"If they are not redeemed and our long-term credit rating falls below investment 
grade or credit ratings are no longer issued, their annual yield rises by 500 basis points."
"Compensation agreement with the Executive Board and employees in the event of  
a takeover offer."
"The current version of the German Corporate Governance Code dated 
28 April 2022 recommends that no commitments to additional benefits be made in the 
event that Executive Board members terminate their employment contract early due to  
a change of control."
"We fully adhere to this principle, meaning that we have not included 
clauses envisaging a special right of termination or rights to severance subject to a change 
of control in any of the current employment contracts of the members of the Executive 
Board of RWE AG."
"Share-based compensation for Executive Board members and executives is subject to  
the following provisions: in the event of a change of control, RWE will pay out all the 
performance shares that have been finally granted, but have not been paid out yet on expiry 
of the holding period."
"Performance shares granted on a preliminary basis on the date of a 
change of control are valued based on the degree to which the targets have been achieved 
up to that point in time."
"Performance shares granted on a preliminary basis in the year of 
the change of control lapse."
"They are replaced by a new plan of equal value for the Executive 
Board members and executives for the fiscal year in which the change of control occurs and 
the following years."

For RWE, green growth and responsible action go hand in hand."
"We have been reporting 
on approaches, goals and progress in the field of corporate responsibility for over 
20 years and are committed to operating sustainably along our entire value chain."
"By 
building renewable assets, battery storage facilities, hydrogen-capable gas-fired 
power plants and electrolysers, we are making a decisive contribution to the creation of 
a climate-friendly, reliable and efficient energy system."
"The necessary structural 
changes require us to take responsibility from a social and ecological perspective."
"We 
advocate for our employees as well as the communities we operate alongside and are 
engaged to protect the environment."
"We have set targets to bring greenhouse gas 
emissions in line with the global 1.5-degree climate benchmark as part of our 
commitment."
"Moreover, we are committed to the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and the objectives of 
the Paris Climate Agreement."
Non-financial statement compliant with clear targets and standards.
"In accordance 
with Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e of the German Commercial 
Code, this statement for the RWE Group and RWE AG, sets out our approach and progress 
in relation to the sustainability issues which are considered to be material to our business."
"The concepts and management approaches discussed in this statement apply in equal 
measure to RWE AG, which is now also required to report independently."
"We determine 
whether an issue is material and describe concepts based on our years-long reporting and 
on the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)."
"Our non-financial reporting covers all fully consolidated 
companies, in line with the consolidated financial statements."
"Period-related disclosure 
pertains to the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023."
"Information per the 
cut-off date is reported as at 31 December 2023, in line with the scope of consolidation."
"The non-financial statement has been reviewed and approved by the Supervisory Board of 
RWE AG."
"The external audit was conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, which subjected key figures in this statement to various 
audit depths."
"Key figures, which have been audited with reasonable assurance, can be found 
in chapter 4.11 Report from the independent auditor."
"From fiscal year 2024, RWE is required to adhere to the reporting obligations under the 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) of the European Parliament and of the 
Council dated 14 December 2022 (Directive (EU) 2022 / 2464)."
"We will therefore be basing 
RWE’s future sustainability reporting on this regulatory requirement."
Our road to a sustainable business model.
"RWE ranks among the world’s leading energy 
companies."
"We want to shape the green energy world and have aligned our business model 
to our ‘Growing Green’ growth and investment strategy."
"Our operating activities focus on 
energy production, with an emphasis on wind and solar."
"At the end of 2023, 37.6 % of our 
total generation capacity (pro rata) was dedicated to renewables."
"Our core activities also 
include electricity and gas storage, the hydrogen business, trading in energy commodities 
and offering innovative energy solutions to industrial customers."
"Power generation from 
coal and nuclear fuel as well as lignite mining in the Rhenish region west of Cologne no 
longer form part of our core business."
"Our key markets are Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the USA."
"Our 
renewable energy business is also active in a number of other countries such as Poland, 
Spain, Italy, France, Denmark and Greece as well as markets in the Pacific region such as 
Australia and Japan."

It also helps us identify and leverage opportunities.
"This 
includes opportunities and risks arising from sustainability matters that exceed the

systematic concept for introducing an internal control system (ICS) for sustainability KPIs, 
which we began setting up."
"We also started implementing the necessary processes and risk 
control matrices for relevant KPIs."
"Adressing sustainability-related issues can prove challenging given the variety of potential 
influencing factors, each with varying probabilities of occurrence, and the fact that many 
changes can occur over a longer time horizon."
"When identifying sustainability topics which 
could prove relevant to our own business activities or which may arise from business 
relationships, we analysed possible non-financial risks in preparation for our materiality 
analysis."
"Possible implications for the company as well as its business environment and 
stakeholders were analysed in consideration of financial significance and material impact."
Attempting to quantify the aforementioned criteria proved particularly challenging.
"The possible non-financial risks identified 
taking this approach have been outlined in this statement and listed in the following table."
"They served as a basis for our materiality test, among other things."
Sustainability strategy with a broad focus.
"Our mission statement ‘Our energy for a 
sustainable life’ expresses our purpose as a company and reaffirms our commitment to 
sustainability as a guiding principle of our actions."
"Although cutting greenhouse gas 
emissions is very important for us, it is not our only priority."
"Sustainability can take many 
forms and this chapter is dedicated to the most significant sustainability topics."
"More 
information on our business model can be found in chapter 2.1 Strategy."
"We want to be a trailblazer in transforming a conventional business model to a sustainable 
one."
"The nine major topics of our sustainability strategy underpin our ambition to grow 
worldwide while adhering to environmental, social and ethical corporate principles and 
aspirations."
"In partnership with our employees and taking external assessments – for 
example from industry representatives, investors and representatives of civil society – into 
consideration, we identified the topics most relevant to our business."
"This provided the basis 
for developing our sustainability strategy, which was then adopted by the Executive Board of 
RWE AG."
"The Executive Board discussed the sustainability strategy with the Supervisory 
Board, which fully supports the strategic positioning of the Executive Board."
"The nine priority topics cover aspects from across the environmental, social and 
governance spectrum."
"•	 We Act – we preserve the environment for future generations based on scientific facts and 
methods."
"In doing so, we dedicate ourselves to addressing climate protection, biodiversity 
and recultivation as well as the ­
circular economy."
"•	 We Care – we honour the interests of our stakeholders and act responsibly wherever we 
operate."
"Our focus in this area lies primarily on social and societal responsibility, diversity, 
compliance as well as occupational health and safety."
Group-wide organisation for sustainability processes.
"Our company’s strategic 
orientation is determined by the Executive Board of RWE AG, which is responsible for 
establishing and achieving the Group’s objectives."
"The Supervisory Board is directly involved in the corporate and sustainability 
strategy and in making decisions of fundamental importance to the company and does so, 
to some extent via the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, in dialogue with the Executive 
Board."
"A breakdown of accountabilities by Executive Board member can be found in the 
schedule of responsibilities."
"Each Executive Board member is responsible for their own area, 
which is why responsibility for our main topics is distributed with a joint responsibility."
"The 
Strategy & Sustainability department is assigned to the portfolio of the CEO and is in charge 
of developing the Group’s sustainability strategy, reporting, and implementing initiatives of 
strategic relevance."
The department supports the Executive Board as a whole in this regard.
"This work covers topics such as climate protection, biodiversity and the circular economy as 
well as other strategic topics that pertain to overarching issues."
"This happens in close 
coordination with the relevant departments and Group companies, which may have their 
own sustainability officers."
"The Strategy & Sustainability department provides the Executive 
Board with quarterly updates on progress made on the variety of sustainability activities 
within the Group."
"The Legal, Compliance & Insurance department is also overseen by the 
CEO."
Personnel matters are within the Chief Human Resources Officer’s remit.
"This includes 
responsibility for the Employee Relations and People Management & Talent Attraction 
departments."
"The Chief HR Officer is also responsible for Group-wide coordination and 
assessment of occupational health and safety."
"The degree to which sustainability targets are achieved determines both the short-term and 
long-term remuneration of the members of the Executive Board of RWE AG."
"More 
information can be found in the Remuneration Report, which we publish separately."
"This 
document can be viewed and downloaded at www.rwe.com/remuneration."
Our Executive Board and employees are guided by RWE’s corporate values.
"These values 
form part of our culture and demonstrate how we want to be perceived by customers, 
partners and society."
"They are: passion, trust and performance."
"In the year under review, we 
associated our corporate values with essential behaviours."
"These desired behaviours are 
intended to foster qualities such as collaboration and courage, and contribute to the 
continued success of RWE."
"Moreover, our Code of Conduct establishes Group-wide 
behavioural rules and obliges our employees to demonstrate responsibility, honesty, loyalty 
and respect to both people and the environment."
"The values and principles are set out in 
further documents and policies on specific topics."
Topics covered by the report are embedded in our strategy.
"We observed legal 
requirements and the results of our materiality analysis when identifying topics for the non-
financial statement."
"Selected topics are based on a comprehensive analysis conducted in 
2021 and updates from 2022 and 2023, evaluating the effects the topics have on RWE as 
a company as well as the impact RWE has on sustainability topics."
"A list of potential topics 
based on discussions with stakeholders was compiled in consideration of relevant 
sustainability rankings and standards."
"The survey on the assessment of the topics was 
conducted in 2021 via an online questionnaire for external stakeholders, such as business 
partners, investors, politicians as well as community groups and associations."
"The 
Strategy & Sustainability department of RWE AG assessed and evaluated the responses with 
assistance from decision makers within the Group."
"We have an impact on 
the climate, on nature and on the environment through our conventional and renewable 
assets."
"In the following sections, we report on our major strategic topics: climate 
change, innovation, biodiversity and the circular economy."
"We also comment on our 
environmental management system as well as how we record environmental events."
Clear pledge to protect the climate.
"We are committed to the goals of the Paris Climate 
Agreement, which seeks to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius above 
pre-industrial levels."
Decarbonisation of the electricity sector is a major factor in this regard.
We emit greenhouse gases above all from our conventional power stations.
"At the same 
time, however, our investments in renewable energy are driving the transition to climate-
friendly electricity production."
"Our business activities also cause emissions beyond our own 
operations, which are referred to as Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, e."
"from the 
production of goods and services which we purchase or from sales of gas and lignite 
products to end customers."
We are aiming to reach net-zero by no later than 2040.
"Not only does this apply to our own 
greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1), it also covers emissions in the upstream and 
downstream value chain (Scope 2 and 3)."
"We remain focused on our medium-term climate 
targets as we move towards climate neutrality."
"During the year under review, we raised our 
targets for 2030, setting our sights on reducing total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 67.6 % 
and our Scope 3 emissions by 42 %."
Our base year for these assessments is 2022.
"Our 
targets are designed to bring greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5-degree climate 
benchmark."
"We are currently working to become certified in accordance with the standards 
of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which focuses on reducing rather than 
neutralising emissions in the energy sector."
"Our strategy is geared towards helping 
decarbonise the electricity system through the rapid expansion of renewables."
"A core 
component of the energy transition is moving away from electricity generation from fossil 
fuels and embracing renewables."
"In 2023, the topics were also validated during interviews with investors."
"For the purposes of this statement, we have assigned the identified topics to the five aspects 
set out in the German Commercial Code."
"The supply gap 
caused by the coal phaseout cannot be closed with additional renewable assets and battery 
storage solutions alone."
"RWE wants to build flexible backup capacities to help bridge 
generation fluctuations from solar and wind."
"This is why we are planning to build our new 
hydrogen-capable gas-fired assets largely in Germany, which will then be used to generate 
carbon-free electricity."
"We have also developed road maps that outline how our existing 
gas-fired power stations can sustainably generate electricity, e."
"with climate-friendly 
hydrogen."
Our Dutch power stations are currently fired with hard coal and biomass.
"We will 
be retrofitting them to run exclusively on biomass by late 2024 (Amer 9) and late 2029 
(Eemshaven) respectively or will shut them down."
"This will allow us to wind down our hard 
coal-fired power generation by 2030."
"In the year under review, we updated our ‘Growing Green’ strategy and announced more 
ambitious growth targets."
"We are now aiming to build 65 GW of global capacity by 2030 to 
decarbonise our portfolio, with plans to invest €55 billion in renewables, storage 
technologies, flexible generation and hydrogen projects."
"Other measures are designed to 
reduce emissions from our supply chain, e."
from procuring wind farm components.
"We 
continued to formalise new partnerships in our renewables business to gradually scale back 
our emissions from the production of key input materials such as steel."
"For example, we 
have signed an agreement to use Siemens Gamesa’s GreenerTowers at Thor, an offshore 
project we are in the process of building."
"Manufacturing the steel plates for these towers 
emits at least 63 % less CO2 compared to conventional steel."
"RWE is also a partner of the 
Carbon Trust’s Offshore Wind Sustainability Joint Industry Programme, which was launched 
in January 2023 to develop an industry-backed methodology and guidance on how to 
measure and address offshore wind farms’ carbon emissions throughout their life cycle."
"As a company, we engage in the political and social discourse on climate and energy-
related topics."
"In this regard, we expect the industrial associations of which we are members 
to be aligned with our key positions on climate matters – this means supporting the Paris 
Climate Agreement and committing to the expansion of renewables among other things."
"We 
regularly evaluate the positioning of associations we are affiliated with."
"The most recent 
assessment took place in in the spring of 2023, which involved examining and evaluating 
the public statements of some 34 renewables associations."
"No deviations from RWE’s core 
positioning were identified during these evaluations."
"We are looking to re-examine 
associations that are aligned with conventional generation in 2024."
"In preparation for the long-term effects of climate change, we conducted our first climate 
risk analysis in 2022."
"Based on this analysis of over 250 RWE locations worldwide, we 
continued our climate-risk assessments in 2023, with a focus on new assets."
"In doing so, we 
prioritised technology-specific risks pertaining to the major expansion of our Offshore and 
Onshore Wind segments."
"Most assets in our pipeline were considered for the period ending 
2039 using the most recent data, e."
"the sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) report."
"In addition to technology-specific risks, we also included a 
technology-independent analysis for new locations based on the modelled probabilities of 
extreme weather events due to precipitation, wind speeds and temperatures."
"The aim here 
is to identify relevant risks of significant damage to infrastructure."
"To date, we have noted no 
foreseeable risks, which could have a material impact on our activities, see the section on 
EU taxonomy."
"Last year, our power stations emitted around 62 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
equivalent, i."
23 million metric tons less that the year prior.
"This was attributable to lower 
emissions from conventional power generation, in particular."
"We were able to improve the 
database for Scope 2 emissions compared to the previous year."
"Our indirect Scope 3 
emissions dropped notably in 2023."
"Fuel- and energy-related emissions (category 3.3) and 
the utilisation of sold products (category 3.11) contributed significantly to this reduction."
"Scope 1 and 2 emissions per unit of electricity generated – therefore 
dropped to 0.48 CO2e / MWh."
"In order to develop and enhance our data acquisition and evaluation methods we made a 
number of changes in 2023 to improve accuracy."
"Comparative information from previous 
years has been restated accordingly."
Further information can be found at www.rwe.com/emissions.
"2	 
Electricity generation from our own power stations amounted to 129,701 GWh in the year under review."
"In 2022, our 
portfolio generated 156,794 GWh."
"Prior year figures have been restated due to a change in the calculation method 
applied."
"Emissions from power supply contracts have therefore been reported under category 3.3 since 2022 rather 
than Scope 1, provided RWE controls the deployment of the power plants."
"Before 2022, our Scope 1 emissions 
contained biogenic emissions, which are reported separately as of 2023."
"3	 
Indirect energy-related emissions (Scope 2) are calculated using the location based method, i."
"location-specific 
emission factors are applied."
Prior year figures have been restated due to a change in the calculation method applied.
"Since 2022, Scope 2 figures have been retroactively recorded for each location individually, making them more 
precise."
"4	 
We continue to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions based on our procurement volume."
"In the year under review, 
we updated the way in which we calculate certain renewables product groups, i."
"capital goods, by taking a 
material / usage based approach and applied the relevant emissions factors."
"The calculation process for all other 
product groups has not changed compared to 2022."
"5	 
Includes adjusted figures since 2023 to avoid double counting with category 3.3."
"This change has been retroactively 
implemented for fiscal 2022."
"6	 
As of 2023, we now also include emissions from waste for third-party processing in addition to third-party disposal."
This change has been retroactively implemented for fiscal 2022.
"7	 
Emissions factors applied do not take radiative forcing into account."
"8	 
Includes emissions from the sale of lignite refining products and gas to end customers."
"9	 
Retroactively included in reporting since 2022."
"Category 3.15 subsumes relevant financial holdings of the 
RWE Group that were not fully consolidated in accordance with our accounting policies and are therefore not already 
included in Scope 1 or 2."
We base our selection on our prorated equity and the emissions intensity of the business.

Technologies driving sustainable development."
"The transformation of the energy industry 
presents us with many challenges, which we at RWE are looking to tackle head-on."
"We want 
to find solutions by collaborating with our partners in industry and sciences and have 
launched or further progressed innovation projects for this purpose, e."
"to develop new 
renewable generation technologies, storage solutions or large-scale hydrogen applications."
"During the period under review, we also 
succeeded in gaining the necessary permits for our GET H2 Nukleus project in just seven 
months."
The planned 2 x 100 MW electrolyser in Lingen is the first of its size.
"In total, the 
project will have a capacity of 300 MW."
We intend to use it to help decarbonise industry.
"More 
information on our activities is set out in chapter 2.2 Innovation."
Growth in harmony with biodiversity.
"Worldwide biodiversity loss and damage caused to 
ecosystems pose a risk to our planet."
"Current findings indicate that climate change will 
exacerbate these trends."
"Both the use of renewable energy and the preservation of 
biological diversity are crucial to ensuring the planet remains habitable."
"However, 
construction work and producing electricity from renewable energy also have an impact on 
nature."
"Our lignite mining activities consume natural resources and affect ecosystems, too."
We want all new assets to have a positive net effect on biodiversity from no later than 2030.
"Special consideration should be given to the local flora and fauna when developing and 
operating energy systems and projects along with the necessary infrastructure – no two 
projects or plants are the same, each has their own, unique natural environment."
"At present, 
there are no standardised methods for measuring these influences, but we are helping to 
develop them in initiatives such as the Science Based Targets for Nature (SBTN)."
"Environmental legislation and approval conditions, which are often strict, set the framework 
for our operating activities in the regions in which we operate."
"The operating units are 
responsible for fulfilling our legal obligations related to planning, building, operating and 
decommissioning our assets."
We have experts in every area for this purpose.
"We try to avoid, 
reduce or, as a last resort, offset negative effects."
"These principles are rooted in our 
biodiversity policy."
"Since 2015, RWE has had a set of rules that establishes measures to 
protect and promote biodiversity in the Rhenish lignite mining region."
"We apply the highest 
standards in restoring biodiversity when recultivating land used for mining."
"In our growth 
business, we implement a variety of audits and measure to meet permit conditions, which 
can be extensive."
"By taking early and continuous measures such as environmental 
compatibility audits and monitoring, we gain insights which allow us to ensure that our 
activities have the least possible impact on existing ecosystems and the flora and fauna 
they include."
The capacity figures are prorated.
"2	 
Figure adjusted to exclude exogenous effects that cannot be controlled by RWE."
"These relate to exceptional 
circumstances, e."
mandatory lifetimes of our Emsland nuclear power station and of our lignite-fired power plants.
"This key figure allows for carbon 
dioxide emissions to be measured independently of load fluctuations caused by the weather 
and the market."
"In 2023, this figure dropped to less than 0.35 metric tons of CO2 per MW 
for every full-load hour, which reflects our transition to more environmentally friendly power 
generation."
"More detailed information can be found in the Remuneration Report, which is 
published separately."
"We carried out an environmental 
impact assessment according to the preliminary SBTN guidelines, for example, and shared 
learnings made while determining freshwater targets with the initiative."
"We are currently 
helping SBTN ensure their guidelines are applicable to the energy industry."
"Our commitment 
to protecting biodiversity is also reflected in the fact that we were one of the first companies 
to join the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD)."
"Operationally, we have progressed and launched pilot schemes, one example being 
our onshore wind farm in Nysäter (Sweden), where we are examining how best to encourage 
biodiversity in a forest setting."
"An environmental impact assessment encouraged us to build 
a ‘creotope’ to develop habitats for ecologically important plants and animals, e."
"by 
transforming meadows with deadwood and sand piles."
"Redesigning these areas is expected 
to improve biodiversity."
"These pilot projects help us identify which measures can be best 
implemented in a forest environment."
"We will continually monitor the impact these changes 
have on biodiversity over the lifetime of the wind farm and apply learnings to other projects."
"RWE is also part of the Dutch Black Blade study: seven RWE wind turbines in Eemshaven 
have each been fitted with one black and two white rotor blades."
"One of the goals is to find 
out whether painting rotor blades black can help birds fly between the turbines more safely."
"The study is based on the assumption that the black blade provides more contrast and 
therefore improves the visibility of the turbine."
"The study is still ongoing, but here too we 
expect to apply any insights gained to other projects."
"Adhering to high standards and applying internal environmental processes is of key 
importance to us."
"Each RWE company nominates an environmental officer, who sits on its 
management board."
"These officers work within the environmental management system to 
ensure that environmental protection is reliably actioned in accordance with applicable 
operator duties and our sustainability principles."
"Above and beyond this, environmental 
management officers and central environmental coordinators regularly review, evaluate 
and improve the relevant environmental management systems."
"Within the framework of 
integrated compliance reporting, the Chief Compliance Officer also reports environmental 
protection matters as well as severe environmental events to the Executive Board and Audit 
Committee of RWE AG."
"In certain cases, the responsible departments also report directly to 
the Executive Board."
"The goals and processes we have in place to protect the environment 
are set out in Group-wide rules."
"For example, the Group’s environmental directive 
determines uniform principles for environmental protection in line with ISO 14001:2015."
"The policy applies to all affiliated companies reported in the consolidated financial 
statements which have operations involving personnel and / or assets."
"Our environmental management system and established reporting on potential 
environmental events are important mainstays of our endeavours to protect the environment."
"RWE uses the degree of coverage of its environmental management system as a key 
performance indicator."
"We aim to reach a full coverage by environmental management 
systems, either through external certifications or internal audits."
"The coverage is determined 
by the share of the workforce covered by the environmental management system and the 
degree of coverage."
"In 2023, we achieved a coverage rate of 99.1 %."
"The slight deviation from 
our target is due to follow-up measures from some monitoring audits not being fully 
implemented."
"In addition, we aim to avoid severe environmental incidents."
"We define these as 
having serious ramifications that are of substantial public interest and can only be controlled 
or managed with external support."
"They also include permit infractions caused by or 
associated with our activities."
"In the year under review, there were, once again, no incidents to 
report."

Driving the circular economy."
"At present, consumption of natural resources clearly 
outweighs replenishment and regeneration."
"To be able to deliver our growth strategy 
successfully, we depend on a steady supply of raw materials and the components or 
products manufactured using these resources."
"Some of them have been identified as 
critical commodities by the European Union and other countries."
"Gradually increasing 
circular quotas enables us to reduce our dependency on primary materials while adding 
value through more efficient use of resources."
"This can keep growth from being curtailed by 
scarcity."
"Furthermore, we expect stakeholders and legislation in the EU, in particular, to call 
for increasingly high standards in the circular economy."
We aim to maximise our circularity by 2050.
"This involves reducing the use of natural 
resources as well as designing plants and processes that enable materials to be reused or 
recycled and waste to be minimised when working with our vendors and service providers."
"When it comes to recycling our material outflows, we have set ourselves a target: to achieve 
a recycling rate of over 90 % in our core business by 2030."
"This figure reflects the share of 
materials and components no longer needed and waste, that is not disposed of in landfill 
sites or incineration plants but is instead put through a recovery, extraction or recycling 
process to ready it for reuse."
"This quota does not consider ash from our lignite-fired power 
generation that is used for example to recultivate land in line with applicable permits."
"In addition to RWE’s Code of Conduct, which contains general goals regarding the 
protection of the environment and the use of resources, we have also set out our efforts to 
help build the circular economy in a Group directive."
"The Group companies are responsible 
for drafting a plan of measures for the period until 2030 and setting targets."
"Implementation is up to the management board members in charge of sustainability and 
the environment."
"They are supported by the sustainability teams and environmental 
management officers."
"The renewables Group companies, in particular, have already 
specified additional steps and targets and have begun to implement them."
"Our Offshore 
segment, for example, is planning to transition to using completely recyclable blades 
wherever possible by 2030 and increase the portion of recycled steel in any new 
procurements to 40 % by 2030."
"In 2023, after successful tests at our German offshore wind 
farm Kaskasi, we opted to fit 44 of the 100 turbines in our largest construction project Sofia 
off the coast of Great Britain with recyclable blades."
"The new rotor blades feature composite 
materials, which can be debonded at the end of their service life and recycled for new 
applications."
"They, thus, help pave the way for fully recyclable wind turbines."

Excluding our US operations due to a reorganisation process that had not yet been completed in 2022."
"In this chapter, we report on some of these stakeholders, e."
"in relation 
to our approach to diversity, health and social responsibility."
"To us, social responsibility 
extends beyond how we treat our employees, to encompass how we engage with local 
communities and municipalities near our sites."
Promoting diversity and inclusion within the company.
"Every day, more than 20,000 
employees give their all to ensure our company’s success."
"Their unique experiences, 
backgrounds and skills have made our company the business it is today."
"Here at RWE, we 
see this diversity as one of our strengths, that helps the company grow and be more 
successful."
"We want to create an inclusive working environment for our employees with a 
zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and where any barriers to continous development 
are removed."
"RWE has introduced a target on the proportion of women in management positions: 
by 2030, 30 % of managerial positions throughout the Group in the core business have to 
be held by women (not including the Coal / Nuclear segment)."
"This objective only applies to 
our core business as setting a goal for the Coal / Nuclear segment is not deemed practical 
given the reduction in personnel necessary in this part of our business."
"Information on targets imposed on supervisory boards and management by law in 
Germany can be found in the Corporate Governance Declaration, which has been published 
separately at www.rwe.com/corporate-governance-declaration."
"It is important to us to create a working environment that enables all our employees to 
reach their full potential and feel supported according to their particular needs."
"Diversity, 
inclusion and anti-discrimination are enshrined throughout the Group in our Code of 
Conduct and we explicitly expect our business partners to adhere these guidelines."
"We 
oppose all forms of discrimination and reaffirmed this commitment in our RWE anti-
discrimination policy and an RWE statement on diversity, equity and inclusion, which was 
published during the year under review."
"In addition to the Corporate Diversity & Inclusion 
team, which prepares Group-wide objectives and measures, companies within the Group 
are also accountable for driving activities going above and beyond this."
"These measures 
address the specific requirements of the respective companies and sites."
"Diversity 
champions help roll out these measures within the Group companies."
"Many employee-led 
groups and networks are active at RWE, including the Representative Body for Severely 
Disabled Employees, the Women’s Network, the LGBT*IQ & Friends Network, Diversity 
Ambassadors and the Empower Network for Disability, Neurodiversity and Mental Health."
Our networks continue to grow across borders.
"The LGBT*IQ & Friends Network has around 
450 international members and our Women’s Network has over 1,200 members worldwide."
Both networks host their own online and offline events.
"Many employees that are not 
affiliated with a network also actively help action measures to foster a lived, inclusive 
corporate culture."
"In 2023, RWE once again hosted a Diversity Week inspired by this year’s theme ‘Energising 
our inclusive culture’."
"Around the world, RWE employees participated in online seminars with 
interesting keynote speakers and attended exciting, innovative on-site sessions."
"Events such 
as these help us nurture and share our inclusive culture."
Digital accessibility was also spurred Group-wide in 2023.
"Over 280 apps were reviewed 
and improvements for employees with disabilities were initiated and implemented."
"For the 
first time, external stakeholders also requested accessible PDF documents."
"In the year under review, we increased the proportion of women in leadership positions to 
23.1 % in part by filling vacancies."
"To continue meeting our targets, we always require a 
woman to be shortlisted for all leadership and management vacancies."
"We also regularly 
review our talent programmes to support representative participation and use demand-
oriented operational levers, including round tables, to eliminate systemic bias."
"To emphasise 
our commitment to gender equality, RWE signed the United Nations’ Women’s 
Empowerment Principles."
"The share of women on the Executive Board of 
RWE AG was 33.3 %."
Staying safe and healthy at RWE.
"The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees are 
particularly important to us as an employer."
"To keep an eye on all matters related to the 
variety of workplaces in which we operate, we have therefore implemented occupational 
health and safety (H & S) as a firm fixture in our corporate policy."
"We aim to optimise the safety of every employee’s workplace, be it at a wind farm, in an 
opencast mine, at one of our power stations or in an office."
"The guiding principle ‘All 
accidents are avoidable – we give priority to occupational health and safety’ reflects our 
commitment in this area."
"The objective of our health management work is to offer staff 
members measures tailored to their needs through which they can maintain and promote 
their physical, mental and social health and wellbeing."
"Occupational safety is of central 
importance to the RWE Group and is thus linked to Executive Board remuneration."
"The key 
performance indicator established for occupational safety is the number of work-related 
accidents among in-house and contract staff resulting in at least one day of absence for 
every 1 million work hours (lost time incident frequency – LTIF)."
"The RWE Group’s target LTIF 
is 1.9."
"We continue to strive to prevent any fatal work-related accidents among our staff or 
the employees of our partner companies."
"We have defined the necessary responsibilities at RWE to firmly embed occupational safety 
across the Group."
"The Chief Human Resources Officer and Labour Director, who sits on the 
Executive Board of RWE AG, is responsible for the Group-wide coordination and assessment 
of occupational H & S."
"She is informed, advised and assisted by the Health and Safety team 
of RWE Power AG which, in addition to providing occupational H & S services to RWE AG, also 
pools expertise throughout the Group and acts centrally in addressing general topics."
"Group 
companies have their own units dedicated to H & S."
"The Group Policy defines principles and 
standards for occupational H & S that are applied across the Group."
"To ensure compliance, 
each Group company appoints at least one responsible member of its executive or 
management board to take responsibility of H & S."
"We have established occupational safety 
management systems in our Group companies to facilitate achieving the company’s H & S 
goals."
"The systems establish structures, goals and procedures."
"Corresponding guidelines 
and processes are monitored systematically and improved continually in accordance with 
the plan-do-check-act cycle."
"Furthermore, Group companies are advised to obtain external 
certification for their occupational safety management systems (e."
"The role 
of the health management system satisfies the legal requirements in the respective country."
"In Germany, it primarily comprises services rendered by company physicians and 
emergency medical technicians, the continued development of measures to promote health 
and prevent illness and injury, ergonomic workplace design and counselling."
"The 
International Health Standard (IHS) of the RWE Group specifies the minimum standard of 
health products and services that must be offered to every RWE employee worldwide."
"These 
include counselling to work through professional and personal challenges, referrals to 
specialised physicians and emergency care on business trips, for example."
"In order to 
convey the main elements of occupational H & S in the context of managing employees, the 
Group companies have implemented prevention programmes aiming to ensure responsible 
behaviour among executives."
"In the year under review, the LTIF remained constant at the previous year’s level of 1.5."
"The 
LTIF for RWE personnel was 1.1 and also remained stable compared to the preceding year."
"In the year under review, there were no fatal accidents."
1	 The Coal / Nuclear segment is not part of our core business.
"Transitioning to new ways of working along with the 
challenging demographics and shortage of skilled labour it brings will change the way in 
which people work."
"As plants are decommissioned, sites that have often been operated for 
years will have to be closed down."
This will affect our staff.
"At the same time, developing and 
expanding new ways to generate electricity presents us with various opportunities and 
harbours potential not just for our own employees, but also for the communities in which we 
operate."
"As a company, we want to ensure this transition is socially acceptable and 
considers input from affected stakeholders."
"The fact that we advocate for our employees and strive to find socially acceptable solutions 
for necessary transitions is part of who we are as a company."
"For us, ‘just transition’ is 
synonymous with treating our employees fairly and responsibly."
"We therefore stand by those 
employees whose jobs are affected by the energy transition, and seek socially acceptable 
solutions and prospects for them, particularly whenever difficult decisions are unavoidable."
"We strive to be a good employer, no matter where our employees work."
"We want to offer a 
working environment that attracts new talent, promotes existing potential and provides fair, 
performance-based pay."
"Our engagement index is an important indicator when it comes to measuring success in this 
area."
"Once a year, we seek to establish how motivated our workforce is and document the 
results in a Group-wide survey."
"Four of the 24 questions in our 2023 survey expressly 
related to the engagement index."
"The indices and figures are determined by calculating the 
percentage of people responding to questions with one of the first two options (‘I agree 
entirely’ and ‘I agree’)."
"In the year under review, our engagement index was again up by 4 % on the previous year, 
coming in at 88 %."
"This exceeded our target value of 80 %, meaning all key indicators have 
improved based on a Group-wide participation rate of 78 % (compared to 74 % in 2022)."
"This was in part attributable to targeted communication in the run-up to and during the 
survey."
"Whereas our growth 
business is focused on recruiting new staff, we are already confronted with necessary 
decommissioning activities in the Coal / Nuclear segment."
"Due to our exit from nuclear and 
coal-fired generation, we will need to cut 9,000 jobs over the short and long term."
"The 
announced accelerated phaseout will have significant ramifications for many employees."
"As 
before, RWE plans to carry out the personnel adjustment to the new decommissioning 
roadmap in a socially acceptable manner."
"For older employees, we are able to offer an 
adjustment allowance (APG) provided by the Federal government or our partial retirement 
scheme (ATZ)."
"We plan to provide younger employees, who cannot take early retirement, 
with opportunities within the company or with other employers."
"Extensive qualification and

We want to make a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate."
"In 2023, 
we took a significant step forward in terms of community engagement."
"We published a 
policy statement and also introduced a central complaints process to ensure we receive all 
feedback from communities."
"RWE values the importance of open dialogue, so we interact 
with a large number of stakeholders on a daily basis."
"We take their interests into account to 
ensure that their views are considered in our goals and plans, from project planning and 
execution to operation."
"Operating functions manage their own contacts with local 
municipalities and communities, paying due regard to national regulations and local 
requirements."
This enables us to cater to local needs and expectations.
"There is no general 
indicator that would enable progress in local engagement to be measured."
"We also ensure that we involve the people who live in the areas adjacent to and surrounding 
our facilities early on and – if possible – share the value added by our plants with them."
"In the 
UK and Ireland, we continue to utilise community funds at the locations where RWE operates 
wind farms."
"In the reporting year, more than £5 million flowed to local communities from 
these funds."
"Thanks to the Renewable Energy Act, we were also able to initiate a similar 
scheme in Germany, where we decided to give all communities with an RWE wind farm or 
ground-mounted solar system a share of the profit."
"This ‘RWE Climate Bonus’, which has 
applied to existing facilities since 1 January 2023 and will future RWE assets upon 
commissioning, will pay €1 million to the municipalities and relevant partners for the 2023 
period."
"In 2023, we created the RWE Foundation, which aims to promote equal opportunities and 
social participation for children and young people."
"To support charitable projects, we gave 
the Foundation €125 million in starting capital in honour of the Group’s 125th anniversary."
Earnings generated will be used to fund the Foundation’s projects.
"More information on the 
RWE Foundation is available at www.rwe-foundation.com/en."
retraining programmes support employees in taking on new roles.
"RWE will help job seekers 
identify new opportunities."
"The Group is strategically navigating the delicate balancing act 
of phasing out conventional assets and expanding its renewables business: the existing level 
of cross-segment collaboration is expected to intensify."
"We are training lignite and opencast 
mining apprentices in our conventional generation division with a view to potentially 
deploying them in our renewables business."
"RWE Power is also taking on the maintenance of 
wind and PV assets in the Rhenish region."
"For RWE, it is important to cement our position as an employer of choice so that we can 
continue to attract new talent and retain skilled employees."
"Throughout fiscal 2023, we 
continued to drive our employer branding, established last year under the strapline “Our 
energy has impact”, as well as our employer value proposition across the Group."
"HR 
guidelines and tool kits designed specifically for recruiters ensure our employer brand 
remains consistent."
We are increasingly focusing on modern ways of working.
"In the year 
under review, we expanded the availability of flexible working hours within the Group to 
optimise work-life balance, for example."
"In 2023, we rolled out our hybrid office concept as 
the Group-wide standard for all new office spaces."
"This mainly involves redesigning team 
rooms and offices in order to create a more comfortable and modern working environment 
and strike a balance between individual workstations and breakout spaces, where 
colleagues can collaborate more effectively."
"Our power stations are the exception in this 
regard."
"The offices at our power plants have to meet fundamentally different requirements, 
which are centred around operations."
"We are working with the individual teams at each site 
to cater to these requirements."
"Here too, we are implementing our hybrid office scheme."
"In 
line with our sustainability goals, we are using large office spaces efficiently and also 
fostering an agile working environment."
"Good company management is indispensable if we want to meet our growth targets 
and create value for our stakeholders."
"In this chapter, we set out our approach and 
progress made in the areas of compliance and ethics."
Integrity and legal compliance are at the heart of everything we do.
"We seek to grow in 
accordance with applicable laws while staying true to our own values and principles."
"To us, 
compliance and ethics therefore translate to preventing corruption and bribery while being 
guided by our values when working with our vendors and partners."
"They must meet the 
standards we impose on ourselves."
All our business activities and decisions meet pre-established compliance requirements.
"We 
do not tolerate compliance infractions of any kind."
"To prevent bribery and corruption, we set 
up a Compliance Management System (CMS) for the RWE Group, which was last reviewed in 
accordance with the IDW 980 Audit Standard of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany 
in 2021."
The system is overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer.
"Group companies in 
Germany and abroad have designated compliance officers, who work to ensure uniform 
implementation of Group-wide compliance policies."
"The compliance officers report to the 
Chief Compliance Officer, who keeps the RWE AG’s Executive Board and Supervisory Board’s 
Audit Committee abreast of relevant compliance issues such as legislative developments, 
CMS updates and leads on potential compliance violations."
"The main objective of the CMS is to permanently ingrain compliant behaviour in the mindset 
and actions of all staff members and strengthen the compliance culture within the Group in 
a sustainable manner."
"In our Code of Conduct, which is binding for all employees, we have 
also listed overarching targets and principles on integrity and observing the law."
"A regular 
compliance risk analysis is an integral component of the CMS."
"Departments and operating 
units are involved in the risk assessment conducted by the Compliance Department, which 
starts by identifying and assessing the key compliance risk fields and ends by deriving from 
the analysis any necessary measures."
"Our employees attend training sessions to learn 
about specific behaviours and measures, in particular to avoid corruption and the 
appearance thereof."
"They take part in annual mandatory compliance courses via an online 
training platform with changing subjects."
"Furthermore, employees attend in-person training 
sessions depending on the risks to which their work is exposed."
"Executive boards and 
management boards also participate in mandatory online courses and in-person training."
It is important to us to have a strong compliance culture throughout the Group.
"All 
managers are obliged to report on the implementation of the Code of Conduct within their 
sphere of responsibility."
"This is referred to as ‘executives’ compliance reporting’, and is 
conducted once a year, in order to create transparency with respect to adherence to the 
Code of Conduct and to provide an overview of compliance awareness at RWE."
"The 
feedback rate of this executives’ compliance reporting serves as an indicator of attention to 
compliance."
We aim to achieve a feedback rate of 100 %.
We met this target again in 2023.

In our efforts to avoid corruption, we concentrated on sensitising our workforce in 2023 
once again."
"During the year under review, the annual mandatory online compliance training 
was dedicated to whistleblowing."
"In addition, our employees are regularly informed via 
in-house media of further compliance matters such as breaking developments, existing and 
new Group policies, the requirements of compliant behaviour, and potential risks arising 
from infractions."
"We empower our employees to share leads concerning potential violations of our Code of 
Conduct or concerning other non-compliant behaviours."
"For example, employees can utilise 
the Group-wide online whistleblower system, where they can choose to remain anonymous."
"Employees and third parties such as suppliers and other business partners all have the 
option to involve an independent external liaison."

We investigate all relevant leads in good time and in a proportionate manner."
"In doing so, we 
ensure the greatest possible protection for whistleblowers."
"Those filing the report in good 
conscience or those who help resolve issues suffer no negative repercussions due to their 
involvement."
"Work-related actions or inactions in response to a report or disclosure and 
which cause or may cause an unjustified disadvantage to the whistleblower will not be 
tolerated."
"We also ensure strict confidentiality is observed when investigating leads, which is 
why we protect the identity of the whistleblower."
"When following leads, we also protect the 
justified interests of individuals affected by a report."
"Incoming leads are checked by the 
Group functions in charge of the investigation."
"Thereafter, if necessary, remedial action is 
initiated as part of a systematic follow-up process."
"We take the necessary and appropriate 
steps in response to all confirmed compliance violations committed by employees and / or 
business partners."
"We seek to minimise the risk of bad business practices by our partners and vendors and to 
ensure ethical and responsible action."
"We aim to contractually commit all suppliers and 
partners that are overseen by Group purchasing to our Code of Conduct."
"When procuring 
fuels, we also aim for all our business partners to be covered by our Code of Conduct 
through our KYC process."
"In the Group, different purchasing teams are responsible for the 
individual buying processes."
"Our Group Procurement Policy provides the common basis for 
purchasing activities and establishes uniform, Group-wide principles of procurement."
"The 
Code of Conduct is a binding element of Group contracts with suppliers."
"By committing to 
our Code of Conduct, service providers and suppliers pledge to observe our or other 
materially equivalent ethical and environmental principles and to action them within their 
supply chains."
"A limited number of purchasing activities are not overseen by Group 
purchasing."
We regularly review our relationships with our business partners.
"If it becomes public 
knowledge that they have violated the principles of the UN Global Compact or other legal 
requirements, we take what we determine to be the requisite and appropriate steps."
"We also 
have standards for purchasing fuel from energy companies on trading markets to minimise 
sustainability-related risks."
"All potential trading partners are reviewed before we engage in 
business relations on the wholesale market and purchase coal, gas or biomass for use as 
fuel from them."

"Since 2023, this law has obliged certain companies to observe due 
diligence obligations relating to human rights and environmental matters in a reasonable 
manner."
"We have introduced a risk management system for all material and relevant 
business activities."
"The system allows us to identify potential human rights and 
environmental risks, avoid or at least minimise these risks and initiate remedial action as 
part of a systematic follow-up process if concrete violations are discovered."
"We recorded 
and published our approach to respecting human rights in a policy statement adopted by 
the Executive Board."
"We appointed the Head of Strategy & Sustainability as the RWE Group’s 
Chief Human Rights Officer, a position which oversees RWE’s human rights-related risk 
management and reports to the Executive Board of RWE AG once a year."
"He is supported by 
a team of experts which collaborates closely and liaises with other stakeholders within the 
RWE Group including legal and procurement professionals."
"We recently also carried out a risk analysis as part of our human rights risk management 
activities."
"An ad-hoc risk analysis was also carried out in light of the Con Edison Clean 
Energy Businesses acquisition in the USA."
"Both analyses identified no significant risks within 
our own business operations."
"However, a number of relevant risks were discovered in our 
direct supply chain."
"As a result, we assessed the prospective and current business partners 
in greater detail to gain a deeper understanding of measures taken to safeguard their 
human rights commitments."
"These audits can either be initiated due to an identified risk or 
an indication of potential human rights violations."
"Appropriate measures were taken on the 
basis of the findings, usually with the aim of improving local conditions."
"In serious cases, we 
do not enter into contractual relationships or reserve the right to end them."

EU Taxonomy
Economic activities are changing and becoming more sustainable."
"This calls for 
investment in sustainable technologies."
"Taxonomy is a classification system in the 
European Union used to identify current and future sustainable economic activities."
"In 
the following, RWE will report on its activities under EU taxonomy."
"The European Commission introduced the European Green Deal to create a modern, 
resource-efficient and competitive economy in order to enable zero net greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050 and decouple economic growth from resource consumption."
"A key 
element of the European Green Deal is EU Taxonomy, which is a classification system to 
establish clear definitions of what constitutes an environmentally sustainable economic 
activity."
"To achieve this, the extent to which economic activities contribute to six defined 
environmental objectives is analysed."
"In the 
year under review, we examined the EU’s new additions to the list of economic activities 
substantially contributing to the first two environmental objectives and also reviewed the 
economic activities that were newly added to the remaining four environmental objectives."
"As before, all RWE activities contribute exclusively to the first environmental objective, 
namely ‘climate change mitigation’."
"Our main economic activities as an energy company 
continue to be renewable energy production and renewable energy storage."
"These activities 
reduce energy generation from fossil fuels, which in turn cuts CO2 emissions and therefore 
makes a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of climate change 
mitigation."
"Previously, the target was to achieve 90 % taxonomy-aligned CapEx by 2030."
This target was raised to 95 % in 2023.
"This is an amendment 
to the EU Taxonomy Climate Act to include activities relating to nuclear energy and natural 
gas."
"We introduced evaluation procedures and reviewed whether our activities are 
fundamentally covered by EU taxonomy (taxonomy eligibility) and whether they comply with 
the criteria set out under EU taxonomy (taxonomy alignment)."
"Our main taxonomy-aligned economic activities are electricity generation from wind, 
photovoltaics and hydropower."
"We also report electricity storage, driving hydrogen 
production and storage as well as bioenergy-fired power generation among our taxonomy-
aligned activities."
"Currently, our natural-gas-fired power generation activities do not yet comply with the 
criteria set out under EU taxonomy."
"The threshold of 550 kg CO2e / KW over an operating 
period of 20 years can only be met by new gas-fired systems that are converted to run on 
hydrogen or a low-carbon gas after a few years."
"We therefore report them as taxonomy-
eligible, but not taxonomy-aligned under activities CCM 4.29 and CCM 4.30."
"The majority of 
our bioenergy activities also do not yet comply with all criteria."
"We therefore currently do not 
report them as taxonomy-aligned (CCM 4.20 and CCM 4.8)."
"At present, individual offshore 
wind farms are awaiting evidence for or clarification of supplementary measures, which 
means they are not currently reported as being taxonomy-aligned but are, however, 
taxonomy-eligible (CCM 4.3)."
"We continue to report the latter as not taxonomy-eligible, as we are 
no longer investing in the expansion of this technology and therefore do not fully comply with 
the requirements of activity 4.28 of the Complementary Delegated Act for gas and nuclear 
energy."
We have assessed taxonomy-alignment in a multi-stage process.
"First, we divided our asset 
portfolio by economic activity in accordance with EU taxonomy and by region, e."
"the USA 
and the European Union."
"Differentiating by region allows screening criteria to be considered 
appropriately through similarities in regional legislation."
"Next, we assessed the substantial 
contribution of the economic activity to climate change mitigation, as this is the EU 
taxonomy objective that all our taxonomy-eligible activities contribute to."
"For most of our 
activities, no additional technical screening criteria have been defined to prove that they 
make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation."
"The delegated legal acts only 
define specific screening criteria with definitive thresholds for hydrogen production, as well 
as electricity generation from hydropower, gaseous fossil fuels and bioenergy."
"With the 
exception of our natural gas activities and the majority of our power generation from 
bioenergy, we comply with these technical screening criteria."
"The aforementioned activities 
do not meet the criteria for alignment."
"Since 2022, we have taken a systematic approach at Group level to criteria under objective 
2 ‘climate change adaptation’ that apply to all our activities."
"In 2023, we expanded our 
cross-portfolio climate risk analysis for our taxonomy-compliant economic activities by 
taking steps to anchor the criteria in our operational processes."
"The analysis focused on 
climate projection scenarios that align best with the lifetimes of our newest assets."
"We also 
considered long-term scenarios and all established and evaluable climate risks referenced 
in the delegated legal act."
"The climate models do not include projection data relating to 
climate risks due to solid matter or certain serious events such as hailstorms."
"Projected 
changes to climate variables were identified based on a group of global climate models."
"Different sources of uncertainty were mitigated by considering various driver scenarios 
among other things."
"Nevertheless, the analysis continues to be most relevant to planned 
assets, assets under construction and recently commissioned assets as projections often 
forecast that climate change will intensify over the longer term."
"Past analyses had already 
considered material environmental risks based on historical data."
"Changes, some of which 
are comprehensive, were implemented to address the findings."
"Noteworthy examples 
include flood protection for run-of-river power stations and retaining basins for plants with 
water-based cooling systems."
"The first step of the vulnerability assessment revealed, among 
other things, changes in wind, sunshine, precipitation and drought duration as being 
technology-specific climate risks."
"We are currently considering specific supplementary data 
such as the age and service life of individual assets to ascertain vulnerability."
"To date, we 
have not uncovered any significant foreseeable risks which could have a material impact on 
our portfolio."
"In accordance with Delegated Legal Act 1 Climate Change Mitigation, Annex 1, certain 
criteria apply to activities that impact on existing bodies of water due to construction and 
operation in order to contribute to objective 3, ‘sustainable use and protection of water and 
marine resources’."
"These criteria apply to our offshore wind, hydropower and hydrogen 
production activities."
"The criteria that must be met are evidenced at project and asset level 
by means of permit applications, environmental impact assessments, surveys, and permit 
requirements in relation to bodies of water in co-ordination with the relevant authorities."
"Objective 4, ‘transition to a circular economy’, is being pursued systematically and is not 
significantly impacted."
"Transitioning to a circular economy is part of our sustainability 
strategy."
Associated processes are therefore implemented throughout the Group.
"In 
addition, we prove that requirements are met by taking measures specific to the circular 
economy at project and plant level."
"The only requirements defined for objective 5, ‘pollution prevention and control’ apply to the 
activity ‘hydrogen production’, which essentially relate to the use of chemicals."
"Due to the 
technology used, we can prove that emissions fall within the referenced ranges based on the 
expert opinions and surveys compiled for permitting processes."
"Here, taxonomy alignment is 
achieved through compliance with requirements under approval procedures and is proven 
at plant level, e."
"g., by furnishing proof of environmental impact assessments and surveys."
"As regards compliance with ‘minimum safeguards’, we lean on the Platform on Sustainable 
Finance reporting for minimum safeguards as well as the FAQ document on minimum 
safeguards published by the EU Commission in 2023 (2023 / C 211 / 01)."
"We have focused 
our review and evidence of compliance on key topics for which compliance with minimum 
guarantees at company level has been defined as relevant in accordance with EU and 
international standards."
"These topics are human rights, corruption and bribery, taxes, 
competition and anti-competition law and data privacy."
"Overall, we comply with all 
requirements defined as minimum safeguards and see this as the minimum socially 
responsible corporate action."
"With regard to human rights, we have established a human 
rights management system for our own activities and supply chain."
"The corresponding 
principles are set out in a declaration of principles."
"The RWE Code of Conduct has guided 
our actions for many years now and leans on the International Labour Organization’s 
general definition of human rights and main labour standards."
"All employees are bound by 
this Code of Conduct, which also forms part of our purchasing teams’ contractual 
relationships."
"To combat corruption and bribery, RWE’s compliance management system, which has also 
been institutionalised in several Group regulations, is designed to prevent and detect 
corruption."
"The management system is regularly reviewed for effectiveness by an external 
auditing firm."
"Our staff members have access to a Group-wide online whistleblower system 
and external liaisons (see the Governance section on page 88)."
"RWE implemented a tax compliance management system based on German audit 
standards in 2019."
Its suitability and effectiveness are monitored internally.
"We track 
compliance risks of major foreign companies of the RWE Group through the international 
management system by reviewing tax declarations, tax payments and tax risks on a 
quarterly basis."
"Similar measures have been taken in the remaining compliance areas with a 
view to ensuring minimum safeguards at all times."
"Our reporting is carried out in accordance with the metrics for the three key performance 
indicators (KPIs): revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx)."
"These metrics are calculated using the EU taxonomy definitions: revenues are defined as 
the portion of net revenue from products and services related to taxonomy-aligned 
economic activities (numerator), divided by total Group revenue (denominator)."
"Expenditure on daily maintenance of our property, plant and equipment primarily relates to 
expenses for the maintenance of wind and solar farms as well as of our conventional power 
plants."
This takes account of purchased and in-house repair measures.
"In addition to the 
service cost, directly attributable material costs, personnel costs and other operating 
expenses are also included."

involved directly assigning individual business units and, in turn, the revenue, CapEx and 
OpEx generated by them to an economic activity in accordance with the Taxonomy 
Regulation."
"This was followed by a review of each economic activity to establish its 
taxonomy alignment."
"If a direct assignment to economic activities was not possible, we were 
able to allocate the KPIs to activities using appropriate allocation procedures."
"To calculate 
revenue, the allocation to our economic activities was essentially based on internal revenue 
from the Supply & Trading segment."
"The reason for this is that power generation is carried 
out at the level of the individual economic activities, whereas the sale of electricity generally 
takes place via the Supply & Trading segment."
"The increase over last 
year was attributable to elevated power generation from photovoltaics, in part from the 
acquisition of Con Edison, the slightly higher prorated earnings from wind power, and the 
boost in hydropower production."
"We expect to be able to further increase the share of 
taxonomy-aligned revenue through the strategic expansion of generation from these 
sources."
"More detailed commentary on the Group’s total revenue can be found on page 143 
of the present Annual Report of RWE AG."

"We aim to significantly expand our green generation portfolio and to 
make the Group climate-neutral by 2040 at the latest."
"Accordingly, we apply an increased 
target of 95 % taxonomy-aligned CapEx to investments as of 2023."
"Total CapEx is 
comprised, among other things, of additions in the schedule of fixed assets presented on 
pages 152 et seq."
"of the Annual Report plus the additions to property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets from changes of control on page 210 of the Annual 
Report."
"We have also invested in renewable energy projects, predominantly wind and solar 
farms and hydrogen, which will be commissioned in the coming years."
"Therefore, we state these activities as CapEx in 
accordance with item 1.2.2.2."
a) of the Taxonomy Regulation.
"We continued to pursue our 
offshore wind project off the north coast of California reported in 2022 as an investment in 
accordance with item 1.1.2.2."
"b) and made further investments in the year under review, 
which are included in the total."
"We invested €502 million in wind and solar power generation, 
hydrogen production and energy storage projects in the year under review."
"over the next three years, we plan to additionally invest we plan to additionally 
invest in these projects, allocating up to €4.3 billion to wind (CCM 4.3), up to €236 million to 
solar (CCM 4.1), up to €672 million to hydrogen (CCM 3.10) and €4 million to electricity 
storage (CCM 4.10)."
"We thus state these activities as CapEx pursuant to item 1.1.2.2 b) of 
the Taxonomy Regulation."
"The following summary shows taxonomy-aligned CapEx broken 
down by the individual component according to the CapEx definition."
"Additions essentially 
relate to additions to property, plant and equipment in the renewables business."
"This mainly stems 
from operating expenditure in our renewables business."
"These generation technologies 
enable relatively low operating expenditure in comparison to other, taxonomy-non-eligible 
activities, particularly in the lignite business."
"The following summary shows taxonomy-
aligned OpEx broken down by the individual component according to the OpEx definition."
These are predominantly maintenance costs.
"We also report adjusted CapEx solely for the disclosure purposes of financial enterprises 
including asset management firms, banks, securities companies and insurance companies, 
in order to avoid duplicate recognition of revenue and CapEx from green bonds in such 
financial enterprises."
"Adjusted CapEx differs from normal CapEx in that the numerator is 
reduced by the amount of investments financed with proceeds from green bonds during the 
reporting period."
This figure totalled €1 billion in fiscal 2023.
"The adjustments thus 
expressly do not reflect any adjustments from a management perspective."
"Adjusted CapEx 
calculated for financial enterprises in the fiscal year amounted to € 10,997 million."
"More detailed information on the taxonomy eligibility of our natural gas and nuclear 
activities can be found on the next page."
"In the previous year, we issued green bonds with a total volume of €2 billion."
"The 
proceeds from the green bonds are being used to expand our renewable energy business as 
part of our Growing Green strategy."
"The bonds were met with keen interest from investors 
and were therefore placed at attractive conditions."

RWE Group."
"Greater Gabbard holds a 500 MW offshore wind farm, which RWE operates 
together with Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) Renewables Holdings."
"RWE owns 50 % of 
the shares and receives 50 % of the power generated (including green power certificates)."
The wind farm is part of the Offshore Wind segment.
"First-time consolidation and deconsolidation generally take place when control is obtained 
or lost."
"Sales of shares which led to a change of control resulted in sales proceeds from disposals 
amounting to €147 million, which were reported in other operating income (previous year: 
€5 million)."
"On 31 January 2023, RWE 
purchased 100 % of the shares in the company Eemshaven Magnum B.V., Amsterdam, 
Netherlands."
"With this acquisition, RWE took over the gas-fired power plant Magnum with a 
net capacity of around 1.4 GW, together with about 70 employees and related solar 
activities of approximately 6 MW."
"The assets and liabilities acquired within the scope of the transaction are presented in the 
following table:
The purchase price was paid exclusively in cash and cash equivalents."
"Income from the negative goodwill was recognised in the line item ‘other operating income’ 
on the income statement."
"The negative goodwill results from purchase price adjustments 
due to a delay in completing the acquisition."
Purchase of Con Edison’s renewable energy business.
"The purchase of 100 % of the 
shares of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, Inc."
"(CEB), Valhalla, USA, was completed on 
1 March 2023."
"This acquisition was agreed with the US group Con Edison, Inc., New York, 
USA, in October 2022."
"CEB is a leading renewables company in the United States, with 
3.1 GW of power generation capacity, around 90 % of which comes from solar systems."
"This 
portfolio is complemented by a development pipeline of more than 7 GW."
"Since first-time consolidation, the acquired company has contributed €350 million to the 
Group’s revenue and – €188 million to income."
"The negative earnings contribution resulted 
from an impairment recognised on the CGU Dutch Power Plant Portfolio, which was also 
reflected pro-rata in the earnings of the gas-fired Magnum power plant."
"Since first-time consolidation as of 1 March 2023, the acquired company has contributed 
€595 million to the Group’s revenue, €45 million to income and €420 million to adjusted 
EBITDA."
The purchase price was paid exclusively in cash and cash equivalents.
"The goodwill is primarily based on expected future use effects, such as the project 
development competencies of the development team, repowering potential and access to 
new markets."
"The goodwill deductible for tax purposes amounts to €1,452 million."
"Taking account of a purchase price adjustment resulting from contractually 
agreed settlements, the goodwill recognised upon first-time consolidation increased by 
€134 million to €1,495 million."
Acquisition of the British developer JBM Solar.
"On 1 March 2023, RWE acquired 100 % of 
the shares in the British photovoltaic and battery storage developer JBM Solar Ltd, Cardiff, 
United Kingdom."
"Along with a PV project pipeline with a total capacity of around 3.8 GW and 
2.3 GW of battery storage, RWE has also taken on a team of around 30 employees."
The purchase price was paid exclusively in cash and cash equivalents.
"The goodwill is primarily based on expected future use effects, such as the project 
development competencies of the development team."
"If all of the business combinations in the reporting period had occurred on 1 January 2023, 
Group income and Group revenue would have amounted to €1,579 million and 
€28,735 million, respectively."
Acquisition of the Polish solar developer Alpha Solar.
"At the end of August 2022, RWE 
completed the purchase of 100 % of the shares in the Alpha Solar Group, a Polish 
photovoltaics developer with 163 companies."

Disposals and disposal groups
Sale of the grid connection for the Triton Knoll offshore wind farm."
"As a result of 
regulatory requirements, RWE was required to sell the grid connection for the Triton Knoll 
offshore wind farm in the United Kingdom."
"The sale of the grid connection, which was 
assigned to the Offshore Wind segment, was completed in December 2023."
"The gain on the 
disposal amounted to €27 million and was recognised in the ‘other operating income’ line 
item in the income statement."
Sale of the Czech gas storage business.
"The agreement concluded with the Czech state-
owned transmission system operator ČEPS at the end of August 2023 on the sale of the 
Group company RWE Gas Storage CZ, s.r.o., Prague, Czechia, which was responsible for 
RWE’s Czech gas storage operations, was completed on 18 September 2023."
"RWE Gas 
Storage CZ was part of the Supply & Trading segment."
"The gain on deconsolidation 
amounted to €128 million and was recognised in the line item ‘other operating income’ in 
the income statement."
"Consolidation principles
The financial statements of German and foreign companies included in the scope of the 
Group’s financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies."
"On principle, 
subsidiaries whose fiscal years do not end on the Group’s balance-sheet date (31 December) 
prepare interim financial statements as of this date."
"In the previous year, one subsidiary had a 
different balance-sheet date of 31 March."
"Different fiscal years ­
compared to the calendar 
year stem from tax-related reasons or country-specific ­
regulations."
Business combinations are reported according to the acquisition method.
"This means that 
capital consolidation takes place by offsetting the purchase price, including the amount of 
the non-­
controlling interests, against the acquired subsidiary’s revalued net assets at the 
time of acquisition."
"In doing so, the non-controlling interests can either be measured at the 
prorated value of the subsidiary’s identifiable net assets or at fair value."
"The subsidiary’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at full fair value, 
­
regardless of the amount of the non-controlling interests."
"Intangible assets are reported 
separately from goodwill if they are separable from the company or if they stem from a 
­
contractual or other right."
"In accordance with IFRS 3, no new restructuring provisions are 
recognised within the scope of the purchase price allocation."
"If the purchase price exceeds 
the revalued prorated net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the difference is capitalised as 
goodwill."
"If the purchase price is lower, the difference is included in income."
"In the event of deconsolidation, the related pro-rata goodwill is derecognised with an effect 
on income."
"Changes in the ownership share which do not alter the ability to control the 
­
subsidiary are recognised without an effect on income."
"By contrast, if there is a loss of 
­
control, the remaining shares are remeasured at fair value with an effect on income."
"Expenses and income as well as receivables and payables between consolidated companies 
are eliminated; intra-group profits and losses are eliminated."
"For investments accounted for using the equity method, goodwill is not reported separately, 
but rather included in the value recognised for the investment."
"In other respects, the 
­
consolidation principles described above apply analogously."
"If impairment losses on the 
equity value become necessary, we report such under income from investments accounted 
for using the equity method."
"Monetary items are converted using the exchange rate valid on the balance-sheet 
date."
"Exchange rate gains and losses from the measurement of monetary balance-sheet items in 
foreign currency occurring up to the balance-sheet date are ­
recognised on the income statement."
"Functional foreign currency translation is applied when converting the financial statements 
of companies outside of the Eurozone."
"This also applies for goodwill, which is viewed as an asset of the economically autonomous 
foreign entity."
"Expense and income items are translated using annual average exchange 
rates."
"Foreign currency translation differences from converting the financial statements of 
companies outide the euro area are reported in other comprehensive income without an 
effect on income."
"When translating the adjusted equity of foreign companies accounted for 
using the equity method, we follow the same procedure."
"The following exchange rates (among others) were used as a basis for foreign currency translations:
Since 30 June 2022, Türkiye has been classified as a hyperinflationary economy according 
to IAS 29."
"In these financial statements as at 31 December 2023, RWE thus applies IAS 29 
in respect of the financial statements of one fully consolidated Turkish subsidiary."
"As of 
1 January 2022, the related effect from retrospective first-time application amounted to 
€20 million, which was recognised in equity."
"As a result of the application of IAS 29, a loss of 
€6 million from the net positions of the monetary items was recorded in the reporting 
period, which was reported in depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as in 
the financial result."
"In this regard, the consumer price index of the Turkish Statistical Institute 
was used to adjust purchasing power effects."
"As of 1 January 2023, this amounted to 
1,128 basis points (previous year: 687 basis points), which increased to 1,859 basis points 
at the end of the reporting period (previous year: 1,128 basis points)."

Accounting policies 
Intangible assets are accounted for at amortised cost."
"With the exception of goodwill, all 
intangible assets have finite useful lives and are amortised using the straight-line method."
Useful lives and methods of amortisation are reviewed on an annual basis.
"Software for commercial and technical applications is amortised over three to five years 
and is reported under concessions and patent rights."
"‘Operating rights’ refer to the entirety 
of the permits and approvals required for the ­
operation of a power plant."
"Such rights are 
generally amortised over the economic life of the power plant, using the straight-line 
method."
"Capitalised customer relations are amortised over a maximum period of up to 
35 years."
"Goodwill is not amortised; instead it is subjected to an impairment test once every year, or 
more frequently if there are triggers for an impairment."
"Development costs are capitalised if a newly developed product or process can be clearly 
defined, is technically feasible, and it is the company’s intention to either use the product or 
process itself or market it."
"Furthermore, asset recognition requires that there be a sufficient 
level of certainty that the development costs lead to future cash inflows."
"Capitalised 
­
development costs are amortised over the period during which the products are expected 
to be sold."
"Research expenditures are recognised as expenses in the period in which they 
are incurred."
"An impairment loss is recognised for an intangible asset if the recoverable amount of the 
asset is less than its carrying amount."
"A special regulation applies for cases when the asset 
is part of a cash-generating unit."
"Such units are defined as the smallest identifiable group of 
assets which generates cash inflows; these inflows must be largely independent of cash 
inflows from other assets or groups of asset."
"If the intangible asset is a part of a cash-­
generating unit, the impairment loss is calculated based on the recoverable amount of this 
unit."
"If goodwill was allocated to a cash-generating unit and the carrying amount of the unit 
exceeds the recoverable amount, the allocated goodwill is initially written down by the 
­
difference."
"Impairment losses which must be recognised in addition to this are taken into 
account by reducing the carrying amount of the other assets of the cash-generating unit on 
a prorated basis."
"If the reason for an impairment loss recognised in prior periods has ceased 
to exist, a write-back to intangible assets is performed."
"The increased carrying amount 
resulting from the write-back may not, however, exceed the amortised cost."
"Impairment 
losses on goodwill are not reversed."
"Property, plant and equipment is stated at depreciated cost."
"Borrowing costs are 
capitalised as part of the asset’s cost, if they are incurred directly in connection with the 
acquisition or production of a ‘qualified asset’."
"What characterises a qualified asset is that a 
considerable period of time is required to prepare it for use or sale."
"If necessary, the cost of 
property, plant and equipment may contain the estimated expenses for the decommissioning 
of plants or site restoration."
Maintenance and repair costs are recognised as expenses.
"With the exception of land and leasehold rights, as a rule, property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated using the straight-line method, unless in exceptional cases another 
depreciation method is better suited to the usage pattern."
"The depreciation methods are 
reviewed annually."
"These adjustments were carried out in a 
prospective manner."
"As a result of this, the scheduled depreciation of solar assets declined 
by €35 million in 2023 and a decline of €47 million is projected for 2024."
"There were no 
material effects on the scheduled depreciation of battery storage facilities in 2023 and no 
material effects on the scheduled depreciation of such facilities are expected in 2024."
"In relation to lignite mining and generation, the decommissioning data from the Act on 
Coal Phaseout are taken into consideration in determining the useful life spans."
"Property, plant and equipment also include right-of-use assets resulting from leases of 
which RWE is the lessee."
These right-of-use assets are measured at cost.
"The cost results 
from the present value of the lease instalments, adjusted to take into account advance 
­
payments, initial direct costs and potential dismantling obligations and corrected for 
received lease incentives."
"Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line 
method over the lease term."
"For short-term leases and leases for low-value assets, lease instalments are recognised 
as an expense over the lease term."
"For operating leases of which RWE is the lessor, the 
­
minimum lease instalments are recognised as income over the lease term."
"Impairment losses and write-backs on property, plant and equipment are recognised 
according to the principles described for intangible assets."
"Investments accounted for using the equity method are initially accounted for at cost and 
thereafter based on the carrying amount of their prorated net assets."
"The carrying amounts 
are increased or reduced annually by prorated profits or losses, dividends and all other 
changes in equity."
"Goodwill is not reported separately, but rather included in the recognised 
value of the investment."
Goodwill is not amortised.
"An impairment loss is recognised for 
investments accounted for using the equity method, if the recoverable amount is less than 
the carrying amount."
The initial measurement of other financial assets occurs at the settlement date.
"Shares in 
non-­
consolidated subsidiaries and in associates or joint ventures are recognised at fair 
value through profit or loss."
Other investments are also recognised at fair value.
"The option 
to state changes in fair value in other comprehensive income is exercised for some of these 
equity instruments."
"Non-current securities are also accounted for at fair value and changes 
in value are recognised through profit or loss or other comprehensive income depending on 
their classification."
"Gains and losses on sales of equity instruments, for which the option to 
state changes in fair value in other comprehensive income is exercised, remain in equity and 
are not reclassified to the income statement."
"An impairment in the amount of the expected 
credit losses is recognised through profit or loss for debt instruments that are recognised at 
fair value through other comprehensive income."
"The changes reported in other 
­
comprehensive income are recognised with an effect on earnings upon the sale of these 
instruments."

Receivables are comprised of financial receivables, trade accounts receivable and other 
receivables."
"Aside from financial derivatives, receivables and other assets are stated at 
amortised cost minus a risk provision in the amount of the expected losses."
"Loans reported under financial receivables are stated at amortised cost minus a risk 
­
provision in the amount of the expected losses."
"Loans with interest rates common in the 
market are shown on the balance sheet at nominal value; as a rule, however, non-interest ­
or 
low-interest loans are disclosed at their present value discounted using an interest rate 
commensurate with the risks involved."
"Lease receivables from finance leases, in which RWE is the lessor, are reported under 
financial receivables."
"In finance lease arrangements, the substantial risks and rewards 
associated with ownership of the underlying asset are transferred to the lessee."
"Accordingly, 
upon the commencement of a lease, for finance leases the lessor must derecognise the 
carrying value of the underlying asset and record a receivable in the amount of the net 
investment in the lease."
"The payments received from the lessee are divided into payments 
of principal and payments of interest, with the payments of interests determined over the 
lifetime of the lease on the basis of the effective interest rate method."
"CO2 emission allowances and certificates for renewable energies are accounted for as 
­
intangible assets and reported under other assets; both are stated at cost and are not 
­
amortised."
"Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the carrying amount in the separate 
IFRS financial statements and tax bases, and from consolidation procedures."
"Deferred tax 
assets also include tax reduction claims resulting from the expected utilisation of existing 
loss carryforwards in subsequent years."
"Deferred taxes are capitalised if it is sufficiently 
­
certain that the related economic advantages can be used."
"Their amount is assessed with 
regard to the tax rates applicable or expected to be applicable in the specific country at the 
time of realisation."
"The tax regulations valid or adopted as of the balance-­
sheet date are key 
considerations in this regard."
"Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted out 
for each company and / or tax group."
"In some countries in which RWE operates, legal 
regulations on minimum taxation have been introduced in accordance with the OECD 
guidelines for the new global minimum tax framework (BEPS Pillar 2)."
"In line with IAS 12 as 
amended in 2023, the potential impacts on deferred taxes from this are not taken into 
consideration."
"Insofar as inventories are not acquired primarily for the purpose of realising a profit on a 
short-term resale transaction, they are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value."
"Production costs reflect the full costs directly related to production; they are determined 
based on normal capacity utilisation and, in addition to directly allocable costs, they also 
include adequate portions of required materials and production overheads."
"They also 
include production-­
related depreciation."
"Borrowing costs, however, are not capitalised as 
part of the cost."
The determination of cost is generally based on average values.
"If the net realisable value of inventories written down in earlier periods has increased, the 
reversal of the write-down is recognised as a reduction of the cost of materials."
Nuclear fuel assemblies are stated at amortised cost.
"Depreciation is determined by 
­
operation and capacity, based on consumption and the reactor’s useful life."
"Changes in value are 
­
recognised with an effect on income."
"The fair value of gas inventories purchased for resale is 
determined every month on the basis of the current price curves of the relevant indices for 
gas (e."
"The valuations are based on prices which can be observed directly or 
­
indirectly (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy)."
"Differences between the fair value and the 
­
carrying value of inventories acquired for resale purposes are recognised on the income 
statement at the end of the month."
"Securities classified as current marketable securities essentially consist of fixed-interest 
securities which have a maturity of more than three months and less than one year from 
the date of acquisition."
"Securities are measured in part at fair value through profit or loss 
or at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"The transaction costs directly 
associated with the acquisition of these securities are included in the initial measurement, 
which occurs on their settlement date."
"Unrealised gains and losses are recognised 
through profit or loss or other comprehensive income, with due consideration of any 
deferred taxes depending on the underlying measurement category."
"In part, current 
marketable securities are also ­
measured at amortised cost."
"An impairment in the amount 
of the expected credit losses is recognised through profit or loss for debt instruments that 
are stated at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"Changes included in other 
comprehensive income are ­
recognised through profit or loss on disposal of such 
instruments."
"Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand ­
deposits and current fixed-
interest securities with a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition."
"Assets are stated under Assets held for sale if they can be sold in their present condition 
and their sale is highly probable within the next twelve months."
"Such assets may be certain 
non-current assets, asset groups (‘disposal groups’) or operations (‘discontinued 
­
operations’)."
"Liabilities intended to be sold in a transaction together with assets are a 
part of a disposal group or discontinued operations, and are reported separately under 
­
Liabilities held for sale."
Non-current assets held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortised.
"They are 
­
recognised at fair value less costs to sell, as long as this amount is lower than the 
­
carrying amount."
"Gains or losses on the valuation of specific assets held for sale and of disposal groups are 
stated under income from continuing operations until final completion of the sale."
"Gains or 
losses on the valuation of discontinued operations and on certain assets of a discontinued 
operation, which are not subject to the valuation rules pursuant to IFRS 5, are stated under 
income from discontinued operations."
"The stock option plans granted by RWE to executives and members of corporate bodies 
­
are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payment."
"At the balance-sheet date, a 
­
provision is recognised in the amount of the prorated fair value of the payment obligation."
Changes in the fair value are recognised with an effect on income.
"The fair value of options 
is determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies."
"Provisions are recognised for all legal or constructive obligations to third parties which 
exist on the balance-sheet date and stem from past events which will probably lead to an 
outflow of resources, and the amount of which can be reliably estimated."
"Provisions are 
carried at their prospective settlement amount and are not offset against reimbursement 
claims."
"If a provision involves a large number of items, the obligation is estimated by 
weighting all possible outcomes by their probability of occurrence (expected value method)."
"All non-current provisions are recognised at their prospective settlement amount, which is 
discounted as of the balance-sheet date."
"In the determination of the settlement amount, 
any cost increases likely to occur up until the time of settlement are taken into account."
"Decommissioning, restoration and 
similar provisions are recognised for these expenses."
"If changes in the discount rate or 
changes in the estimated timing or amount of the payments result in changes in the 
­
provisions, the carrying amount of the respective asset is increased or decreased by the 
corresponding amount."
"If the decrease in the provision exceeds the carrying amount, the 
excess is recognised immediately through profit or loss."
"As a rule, releases of provisions are credited to the expense account on which the provision 
was originally recognised."
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognised for defined benefit plans.
"These are obligations of the company to pay future and ongoing post-employment benefits 
to entitled current and former employees and their surviving dependents."
"In particular, the 
obligations refer to retirement pensions."
"Individual commitments are generally oriented to 
the employees’ length of service and compensation."
"Provisions for defined benefit plans are based on the actuarial present value of the 
­
respective obligation."
This is measured using the projected unit credit method.
"This method 
not only takes into account the pension benefits and benefit entitlements known as of the 
balance-sheet date, but also anticipated future increases in salaries and pension benefits."
"The provision derives from the balance of the actuarial 
present value of the obligations and the fair value of the plan assets."
"The ­
service cost is 
disclosed in staff costs."
Net interest is included in the financial result.
"Gains and losses on the revaluation of net defined benefit liability or asset are fully 
­
recognised in the fiscal year in which they occur."
"They are reported outside of profit or loss, 
as a component of other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive 
income, and are immediately assigned to retained earnings."
"They remain outside profit or 
loss in subsequent periods as well."
"In the case of defined contribution plans, the enterprise’s obligation is limited to the amount 
it contributes to the plan."
Contributions to the plan are reported under staff costs.
"Waste management provisions in the nuclear energy sector are based on obligations under 
public law, in particular the German Atomic Energy Act, and on restrictions from operating 
licenses."
"These provisions are measured using estimates, which are based on contracts as 
well as information from internal and external specialists."
"Provisions for mining damage are recognised for obligations existing as of the balance-­
sheet date and identifiable when the balance sheet is being prepared to cover land 
­
recultivation, resettlement and relocation and remediation of mining damage that has 
already occurred or been caused."
"The provisions must be recognised due to obligations 
under public law, such as the German Federal Mining Act, and formulated, above all, in 
­
operating schedules and water law permits."
"Such provisions are measured at full expected 
cost or according to estimated compensation payments, which are based on detailed 
contracts as well as information from internal and external specialists."
"A provision is recognised to cover the obligation to submit CO2 emission allowances and 
certificates for renewable energies to the respective authorities; this provision is primarily 
measured at the secured forward price of the CO2 allowances or certificates for renewable 
energies."
"If a portion of the obligation is not covered with allowances that are available or 
have been purchased forward, the provision for this portion is measured using the market 
price of the emission allowances or certificates for renewable energies on the reporting date."
"Upon initial recognition, these are generally stated at 
fair value including transaction costs and are carried at amortised cost in the periods 
­
thereafter (except for derivative financial instruments)."
"Lease liabilities are measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments."
"For subsequent measurements, the lease 
­
payments are divided into the financing costs and repayment portion of the outstanding 
debt."
"Financing costs are distributed over the lease term in such a manner that a steady 
interest rate is created for the outstanding debt."
"If uncertain income tax items are recognised in income tax liabilities because they are 
­
probable, the former are generally measured at the most likely amount."
"Measurement at 
expected value is only considered in exceptional cases."
"Moreover, other liabilities also include contract liabilities."
"­
A contract liability is the obligation 
of the Group to transfer goods or services to a customer, for which we have already received 
consideration or for which the consideration is already due."
"Government grants provided in relation to the acquisition of an asset are not deducted from 
the cost of the subsidised asset; they are reported as deferrals under other liabilities."
"These 
deferrals are reversed with an effect on income over the economic life of the subsidised 
asset."
Government grants related to income are offset against the corresponding expenses.
"Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities and measured at 
fair value, regardless of their purpose."
"Changes in this value are recognised with an effect on 
income, unless the instruments are used for hedge accounting purposes."
"In such cases, 
­
recognition of changes in the fair value depends on the type of hedging transaction."
"Fair value hedges are used to hedge assets or liabilities carried on the balance sheet against the 
risk of a change in their fair value."
"The following applies: changes in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument and the fair value of the respective underlying transactions are recognised in the 
same line item on the income statement."
"Hedges of unrecognised firm commitments are also 
recognised as fair value hedges."
"Changes in the fair value of the firm commitments with regard 
to the hedged risk result in the recognition of an asset or liability with an effect on income."
"Cash flow hedges are used to hedge the risk of variability in future cash flows related to an 
asset or liability carried on the balance sheet or related to a highly probable forecast 
­
transaction."
"If a cash flow hedge exists, unrealised gains and losses from the hedging 
­
instrument are initially stated as other comprehensive income."
"Such gains or losses are only 
included on the income statement when the hedged underlying transaction has an effect on 
income."
"If the transactions 
result in the recognition of non-financial assets or liabilities, for example the acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognised in equity without an effect on 
income are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability."
"The purpose of hedges of a net investment in foreign operations (net investment hedges) is 
to hedge the currency risk from investments with foreign functional currencies."
"With the 
exception of hedging costs, unrealised gains and losses from such hedges are recognised in 
other comprehensive income until disposal of the foreign operation."
Only the effective portion of a hedge is recognised in accordance with the preceding rules.
"The 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately on the income statement with an effect on income."
"Contracts on the receipt or delivery of non-financial items in accordance with the company’s 
expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own-use contracts) are not accounted for 
as derivative financial instruments, but rather as executory contracts."
"If the contracts 
­
contain embedded derivatives, the derivatives are accounted separately from the host 
­
contract, insofar as the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives 
are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract."
"­
Written options to buy or sell a non-financial item which can be settled in cash are not ­
own-
use ­
contracts."
"Contingent liabilities are possible obligations to third parties or existing obligations which 
will probably not lead to an outflow of economic benefits or the amount of which cannot be 
measured reliably."
"Contingent liabilities are only recognised on the balance sheet if they were 
assumed within the framework of a business combination."
"The amounts disclosed in the Notes 
correspond to the best possible estimate of the settlement amount at the balance-sheet date."
"Contingent receivables are possible assets resulting from past events, the existence of 
which must be confirmed by future events that are not under the full control of RWE."
Contingent receivables are not stated in the balance sheet.
"The amounts disclosed in the 
Notes correspond to the best possible estimate of the financial effects at the balance-sheet 
date."
"Renewable energy projects in the USA are primarily subsidised via tax credits and tax 
­
benefits (hereinafter referred to jointly as tax items)."
"Within the framework of so-called 
tax equity financing, tax equity investors participate directly in financing the generation 
facilities of individual project companies."
"Due to its financing character, the capital 
­
contributed by the tax equity investor is reported under financial liabilities, in the amount of 
the outstanding repayment."
"Repayment of interest and capital for the tax equity liability occurs primarily without cash 
outflows via the direct allocation of the tax items generated by the project to the tax equity 
investor, which can then apply the items in relation to its own tax accounting."
"In addition to 
this, repayment of interest and capital also occurs in cash."
"The tax equity arrangement and the related obligation to maintain proper operations is 
treated similar to a contract for services."
"The income resulting from the tax items is 
recorded under other operating income, with this income realised using the straight-line 
method over the anticipated duration of the tax equity contracts."
"In this regard, linear 
­
realisation of the income is capped at the amount of income that will most likely be 
­
generated during the contract, and any amounts above and beyond this are only 
­
recognised up to the amount of income that is actually generated."
Management judgements in the application of accounting policies.
"Management 
­
judgements are required in the application of accounting policies."
"In particular, this pertains 
to the following aspects: 
•	 With regard to certain contracts, a decision must be made as to whether they are to be 
treated as derivatives or as so-called own-use contracts, and be accounted for as 
­
executory contracts."
•	 Financial assets are classified by contractual cash flows and applied business model.
"Whereas the contractual cash flows are determined by the characteristics of the financial 
instruments, the business model is based on the Group’s internal requirements relating to 
the portfolios of financial instruments."
"If both 
conditions apply, the assets and any related liabilities must be reported and ­
measured as 
assets or liabilities held for sale, respectively."
Management estimates and judgements.
"Preparation of consolidated financial 
­
statements pursuant to IFRS requires assumptions and accounting estimates to be made."
"In the event of uncertainties in relation to the measurement of items in the financial 
­
statements, it can be necessary to make accounting estimates."
"The estimates can have an 
impact on the recognised value of the assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheet, on 
income and expenses and on the disclosure of contingent receivables and liabilities."
"Amongst other things, these assumptions and estimates relate to the accounting and 
measurement of provisions."
"With regard to non-current provisions, the discount factor and 
price increases to be applied are important estimates, in addition to the amount and timing 
of future cash flows."
"The discount factor for pension obligations is determined on the basis 
of yields on high-quality, fixed-rate corporate bonds on the financial markets as of the 
­
balance-sheet date, in accordance with the maturities and due dates."
"The rules governing valuation allowances for financial assets under IFRS 9 stipulate that the 
expected credit losses must be determined."
"The valuation allowance is based on information 
from within and outside the Group."
"The impairment test for goodwill and non-current assets is based on certain assumptions 
pertaining to the future, which are regularly adjusted."
"Property, plant and equipment is 
tested for indications of impairment on each cut-off date."
"Power plants and in some cases opencast mines are grouped together as a cash-­
generating unit if their production capacity and fuel needs are centrally managed as 
part of a portfolio, and it is not possible to ascribe individual contracts and cash flows 
to the specific power plants."
"Upon first-time consolidation of an acquired company, the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are recognised at fair value."
"Determination of the fair value is based on 
valuation methods which require a projection of anticipated future cash flows."
Deferred tax assets are recognised if realisation of future tax benefits is probable.
"Actual future 
development of income for tax purposes and hence the realisability of deferred tax assets, 
however, may deviate from the estimation made when the deferred taxes are capitalised."
"Further information on the assumptions and estimates upon which these consolidated 
financial statements are based can be found in the explanations of the individual items."
All assumptions and estimates are based on valuation methods and input factors.
"These 
include climate-related assumptions on the development of prices for CO2 allowances, the 
useful life spans of conventional power stations or for the expansion of the hydrogen 
economy."
"These, in turn, are based on the circumstances and forecasts prevailing on the 
balance-sheet date."
"Furthermore, as of the balance-sheet date, realistic assessments of 
overall economic ­
conditions in the sectors and regions in which RWE conducts operations 
are taken into ­
consideration with regard to the prospective development of business."
"Actual 
amounts may deviate from the estimated amounts if the estimated parameters develop 
differently than expected."
"In such cases, the assumptions, and, if necessary, the carrying 
amounts of the affected assets and liabilities are adjusted."
"As of the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements, it is not presumed 
that there will be any material changes compared to the assumptions and accounting 
­
estimates."
"The focus of RWE’s financing policy is on ensuring uninterrupted 
access to the capital market."
"The goal is to be in a position to refinance maturing debts and 
finance the operating activities at all times."
"Maintaining a solid rating and a positive 
­
operating cash flow from continuing activities serve this purpose."

The management of RWE’s capital structure is oriented towards a leverage factor of three 
or less."
"This indicator is calculated by adding material non-current provisions, with the 
exception of mining provisions, to net financial debt and comparing the resulting figure to 
the adjusted EBITDA of the core business."
"RWE’s liabilities of relevance to net debt primarily 
consist of (hybrid) bonds, commercial paper, tax equity liabilities, short-term borrowing and 
provisions for pensions, nuclear waste management and wind and solar farms."
"In the reporting period, it was primarily cash flows from continuing operations that had a 
positive effect on the RWE Group’s net debt."
"By contrast, the acquisition of Con Edison’s 
renewable energy business and other net investments, in particular on wind and solar power, 
increased net debt significantly during the reporting period."
"In total, net financial assets 
amounted to €0.8 billion on 31 December 2023 and were thus lower than at the end of 
2022 (€8.6 billion)."
"Furthermore, net debt provisions rose by €0.5 billion to €7.4 billion 
(previous year: €6.9 billion)."
"On average, provisions have a very long duration; their level is 
primarily determined by external factors such as the general level of interest rates."
"A precise 
calculation of net debt / net cash and net financial debt / assets is presented on page 56 of 
the review of operations."
"In total, as of 31 December 2023, RWE’s net debt amounted to 
€6.6 billion (previous year: net cash of €1.6 billion)."
"As of 31 December 2023, the leverage 
factor was 0.9 (previous year: – 0.3) and was thus well below the planned ceiling."
RWE’s credit rating is influenced by a number of qualitative and quantitative factors.
"These 
include aspects such as the amount of cash flows and debt as well as market conditions, 
competition and the political and regulatory framework."
"Our hybrid bonds also have a 
positive effect on our rating."
"The leading rating agency, Moody’s, classifies part of hybrid 
capital as equity."
"In October and November 2023, the rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch both confirmed 
their credit ratings for RWE."
"RWE’s long-term creditworthiness is now classified as Baa2 
(Moody’s) and BBB+ (Fitch), with a stable outlook."
"RWE’s short-term credit ratings are 
unchanged versus the previous year at P–2 (Moody’s) and F1 (Fitch)."
Change in the reporting of compensation from redispatch measures.
"In the past, 
compensation received in relation to redispatch measures was reported in other operating 
income."
"Redispatch measures refer to intervention by transmission system operators in the 
generation capacities of power plants to protect network segments against overloading."
"A 
claim for compensation arises when a facility is subjected to a redispatch measure."
"In order to more accurately present the effects of these compensation payments, starting 
from this reporting year the related amounts are reported in revenue."
"The prior-year figures 
were adjusted accordingly, as a result of which the reported revenue increased by 
€49 million in the previous year, while other operating income declined by €49 million in the 
same period."
"We recognise income from the sale of the electricity generated by all of RWE Group’s 
generation technologies and the consumer business in revenue."
"Revenue resulting from the 
commercial optimisation of generation dispatch is based on the net sale price, after 
deduction of the relevant material costs."
"By contrast, all other revenue from our generation 
activities and the consumer business is reported on a gross basis."
"In the year under review, RWE generated reportable external revenue of €6,258 million with 
one large customer in the Supply & Trading segment (previous year: no reportable revenue 
with large customers)."
"A breakdown of revenue by division, geographical region and product is contained in the 
segment reporting on page 206 et seqq."
The item ‘natural gas tax / electricity tax’ comprises the taxes paid directly by Group companies.
"Certain performance obligations of the RWE Group were not yet or not yet fully met by the 
end of the fiscal year."
"The €1,437 million in revenue due from these performance 
obligations (previous year: €1,816 million) is expected to be received over the following 
three years."
"The receipt of this revenue will depend on when these performance obligations 
to the customer are met."
"It does not include future revenue from contracts with an original 
contractual term of twelve months or less."
"The new CGU Nord-Süd-Bahn includes the 
Hambach and Garzweiler opencast mines, the Niederaußem and Neurath power stations 
and the refining operations."
"In the previous year, a write-back up of €801 million was 
recorded for the CGU Nord-Süd-Bahn (recoverable amount: €1.0 billion)."
"Of this write-back, 
€794 million was recognised in property, plant and equipment and €7 million in intangible 
assets in the previous year."
"Additionally, in the previous year a write-back up to the amount 
of the depreciated cost of the CGU of €137 million was recorded for the CGU Inden, on 
which impairments had been recognised in previous periods in accordance with IAS 36 
(recoverable amount: €0.4 billion)."
"The entire amount of this write-back was recognised in 
property, plant and equipment in the previous year."
"The CGU Inden includes the Inden 
opencast mine and the associated Weisweiler power station."
"The write-backs in the previous 
year were justified primarily by the improvement in earnings expectations."
"The write-backs in the previous year 
were applied exclusively to property, plant and equipment and were justified primarily by the 
improvement in earnings expectations."
"The CGU Dutch Power Plant Portfolio includes the 
gas-, biomass- and coal-fired power plants in the Netherlands, while the CGU German Gas 
and Hydroelectric Power Plants contains the gas-fired and run-of-river power stations in 
Germany."
The power plants in the United Kingdom are considered individually.
"In the previous year, other write-backs of secondary importance which applied to property, 
plant and equipment were mainly based on the improvement in earnings expectations."
Details on the calculation of recoverable amounts can be found on page 146.
"A breakdown 
of the write-backs by individual segment can be found in the segment reporting on page 
206 et seq."
"To improve the presentation of the development of business, unrealised and realised gains 
from contracts measured at fair value in the Supply & Trading segment are stated as a net 
amount in income from derivative financial instruments."
"In the year under review, net 
income totalled €3,689 million (previous year: €2,096 million)."
"The amount of income from derivative financial instrument was mainly influenced by the 
high volatility of commodity market prices."
"Income from the disposal of non-current financial assets and loans is disclosed under 
income from investments if it relates to investments; otherwise it is recorded as part of the 
financial result as is the income from the disposal of current marketable securities."
"Expenses for coal in the amount of €165 million (previous year: €623 million) 
and for gas in the amount of €929 million (previous year: €3,151 million) were recognised 
at the market price prevailing at settlement."
"On average, 639 trainees were employed 
(previous year: 682)."
This corresponds to the figure calculated in full-time equivalents.
"As in 
the previous years, executive personnel are included in the number of employees who are 
not covered by collective agreements."
"These impairments reversed 
the write-backs that were necessary in the previous year due to the turbulence on the energy 
markets."
"The CGU Nord-Süd-Bahn includes the Niederaußem and Neurath power stations, 
the Hambach and Garzweiler opencast mines and the refining operations."
"The CGU Inden 
includes the Weisweiler power station and the Inden opencast mine."
"The impairment is mainly 
justified by last year’s much lower market prices for electricity and the associated sharp 
decline in clean lignite spreads compared to the extremely high prices seen in the previous 
year."
"The CGU Dutch Power Plant Portfolio includes the 
gas-fired and biomass / coal-fired power plants in the Netherlands."
"The newly acquired gas-
fired plant Magnum has also been part of this CGU since this reporting period."
"Impairments of €111 million were recognised on property, plant and equipment for offshore 
wind farms in Germany (Offshore Wind segment), due to reduced future feed-in tariffs 
(recoverable amount: €0.9 billion)."
"Additionally, impairments amounting to €52 million were 
recognised on property, plant and equipment in the Offshore Wind segment, due to the 
termination of development projects in Taiwan and Poland."
"In the previous year, in the Hydro / Biomass / Gas segment, an impairment in the amount of 
€46 million was recognised on the combined-cycle gas turbine power plant King’s Lynn in 
the United Kingdom (recoverable amount: €0.1 billion)."
"This essentially stemmed from a 
shorter-than-expected useful lifespan of the power plant, as a result of the UK government’s 
efforts to decarbonise the energy sector by 2035."
"Other impairments on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recognised 
primarily on the basis of changes in price expectations and cancelled development projects."
"Recoverable amounts are generally determined on the basis of fair values less costs to sell; 
in the segments Onshore Wind / Solar and Offshore Wind, they are also determined on the 
basis of values in use."
"Fair values are determined using valuation models based on planned 
cash flows."
"During the reporting period, the valuation models were based on (after-tax) 
discount rates that ranged from 5.00 to 6.00 % (previous year: 5.25 to 6.25 %)."
"Our key 
planning assumptions relate to the development of wholesale prices of electricity, crude oil, 
natural gas, coal and CO2 emission allowances, market shares and regulatory framework 
conditions."
"Based on the use of internal planning assumptions, the determined fair values 
are ­
assigned to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
"It is comprised of income from investments accounted for using the 
equity method and other income from investments."
"The amount of expenses from derivative financial instruments was mainly influenced by the 
high volatility of commodity market prices."
"In the previous year, impairments of €748 million were recognised in ‘expenses from derivative 
financial instruments’ in relation to contracts for hard coal deliveries which were reported as 
derivatives at fair value."
"These impairments were ­
necessary due to the sanctions imposed on 
Russia by the EU and the United Kingdom as a result of the Ukraine war."
"Among other things, the item ‘other taxes and levies’ includes the special taxes that were 
introduced in many European countries for power generation companies during the 
previous year."
"Interest income includes dividend income of €202 million from the 15 % stake in E.ON 
(previous year: €194 million)."
"In the year under review, €56 million in borrowing costs were capitalised as costs in 
connection with the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets (previous 
year: €46 million)."
"The underlying capitalisation rate ranged from 2.4 % to 3.5 % (previous 
year: from 2.1 % to 2.8 %)."
"In the case of provisions for pensions, it is reduced 
by the imputed interest income on plan assets for the coverage of pension obligations."
"Interest expenses incurred for lease liabilities amounted to €65 million in the year under 
review (previous year: €43 million)."
"Other financial 
income also includes €0 million in gains realised from the disposal of marketable securities 
(previous year: €1 million)."
"Of the other finance costs, €0 million (previous year: €26 million) 
stem from realised losses on the disposal of marketable securities."
"Current taxes on income contain €59 million in net tax income (previous year: expenses of 
€97 million) relating to prior periods."
"Due to the utilisation of tax loss carryforwards unrecognised in prior years, current taxes on 
income were reduced by €5 million (previous year: €129 million)."
"Expenses from deferred taxes declined by €1 million (previous year: €685 million) due to 
reassessments of and previously unrecognised tax loss carryforwards."

Taxes in the amount of €985 million (previous year: €1,239 million) were offset directly 
against equity."
"The theoretical tax expense is calculated using the tax rate for the RWE Group of 32.6 % 
(previous year: 32.6 %)."
"This is derived from the prevailing 15 % corporate tax rate, the 
­
solidarity surcharge of 5.5 %, and the Group’s average local trade tax rate."
"The routine profits test is fulfilled for the country in question if the profit before tax is equal to 
or smaller than the substance based income exclusion."
"This test is also met for a country 
that records a loss."
"An analysis of the key peformance indicators for Germany, the Netherlands, the United 
Kingdom and the USA yielded the following results:
•	 Based on the 2023 revenues in the above countries, the de minimis test is not met."
"•	 The simplified effective tax rate test is met for the countries Germany, the Netherlands, 
and the United Kingdom."
"•	 Due to the recognition of a loss, the routine profit test is met in the USA."
"In Germany and 
the USA, the profit before tax is smaller than the substance based income exclusion."
"Based on a more precise calculation model and the current legal situation for the remaining 
countries which do not meet the safe harbour tests, a top-up tax in the amount of roughly 
€2 million was determined, which may potentially result for 2023."
The RWE Group falls in the scope of the OECD model rules (BEPS Pillar 2).
"The goal of this 
regulation is that multinational groups should be subject to an effective tax rate of at least 
15 % in relation to their local earnings in their respective jurisdictions."
"If this level is not 
reached, a so-called ‘top-up tax’ is levied."
"The BEPS Pillar 2 legislation was adopted in 
Germany, the jurisdiction in which the ultimate parent company RWE AG is registered, and 
enters into force on 1 January 2024."
"As this legislation was not applicable as of the 
balance-sheet date, the Group does not have any currently reportable tax risk in relation to 
it."
"The Group is applying the exemption for the recognition and disclosure of information on 
deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to income taxes in the second pillar."
"In some countries in which RWE operates, legal regulations on minimum taxation have been 
introduced in accordance with the OECD guidelines for the new global minimum tax 
framework (BEPS Pillar 2)."
"RWE has reviewed its corporate structure with regard to the introduction of the BEPS Pillar 
Two Model Rules in various jurisdictions."
"As the first step, the application of so-called 
transitional safe harbour rules was examined."
"After this, the top-up tax is temporarily reduced to nil in a jurisdiction, insofar as the country 
in question meets the following conditions:
•	 the de minimis test, or
•	 the simplified effective tax rate test, or
•	 the routine profit test."
"This simplification applies for fiscal years starting before 31 December 2026 and ending 
before 1 July 2028 (transitional period)."
"The de minimis test is fulfilled for the country in question if the revenue according a qualified 
country-by-country report is lower than €10 million and the profit before tax according to a 
qualified country-by-country report is lower than €1 million or if a loss is reported."
"Goodwill breaks down as follows: 
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined, which is defined as the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell or value in use."
"Fair value is the best estimate of the price that an 
independent third party would pay to purchase the CGU as of the balance-sheet date."
"Value 
in use reflects the present value of the future cash flows which are expected to be generated 
with the CGU."
"Fair value less costs to sell is assessed from an external perspective and value in use from a 
company-­
internal perspective."
"Values are determined using a business valuation model, 
based on planned future cash flows."
"These cash flows, in turn, are based on the medium- 
and long-term business plans, as approved by the Executive Board and valid at the time of 
the impairment test."
They pertain to a detailed planning period of three to ten years.
"The 
cash flow plans are based on experience as well as on expected market trends in the future."
"If available, market transactions in the same sector or third-party valuations are taken as a 
basis for determining fair value."
"Based on the use of internal planning assumptions, the 
determined fair values less costs to sell are assigned to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
"The key planning assumptions in the medium- and long-term business plans mainly relate 
to the development of prices for electricity, CO2 emission allowances, natural gas, coal and 
crude oil."
"Additionally, assumptions regarding the development of key economic indicators 
such as exchange rates, gross domestic product and inflation are also incorporated."
"Market 
data is used as much as possible for the medium-term planning, while fundamental models 
are deployed for long-term planning."
"The results of macro-economic and financial studies 
and forecasts are also used as benchmarks."
"The key planning assumptions determined in 
this way are updated to reflect current market conditions every six months."
"For the renewables segments, the valuation is based on a normal wind year, which is 
­
calculated as the average of the last 20 years."
"In the reporting period, goodwill of €1,495 million was created from the first-time 
consolidation of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses and of €183 million from the first-
time consolidation of the UK developer JBM Solar."
"These goodwill amounts were assigned to 
the cash-generating units RWE Clean Energy and Onshore Wind / Solar Europe & Australia, 
respectively."
"The goodwill previously assigned to the operating segment Onshore 
Wind / Solar was allocated in full to the CGU Onshore Wind / Solar Europe & Australia."
"The 
intra-year changes in the CGUs result from translation differences."
"In the previous year, goodwill of €105 million was generated as a result of the first-time 
consolidation of the Polish developer Alpha Solar in the Onshore Wind / Solar segment."
"A regular impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, to determine 
if there is any need to write down goodwill."
"As part of this, goodwill is allocated to the CGUs."
"For the renewables segments, we used a growth rate of 1.25 % (previous year: 0.75 %) as a 
basis for extrapolating future cash flows going beyond the detailed planning period."
"For the 
CGU Supply & Trading, we used a growth rate of 0.50 % for the first time."
"We did not use a 
growth rate as a basis for the CGU Hydro / Biomass / Gas."
"The growth rate for each segment 
is generally derived from experience and expectations of the future and does not exceed the 
long-term average growth rates of the respective markets in which the Group companies 
are active."
"The annual cash flows assumed for the years after the detailed planning period 
include as a deduction capital expenditure in the amount ­
necessary to maintain the scope 
of business."
"The value in use was taken as the basis for the recoverable amount of the CGU Supply & 
Trading."
The pre-tax discount rate was 8.77 %.
"The recoverable amounts of the other CGUs 
were determined as the fair value less costs to sell."
"As of the balance-sheet date, all of the 
recoverable amounts were higher than the carrying amounts."
"The surpluses react especially 
sensitively to changes in the discount rate, the growth rate – insofar as such are used in the 
model – and cash flows in terminal value."
"Of all of the CGUs, the CGU Supply & Trading exhibited the smallest surplus of ­
recoverable 
amount over the carrying amount."
"The recoverable amount was €0.3 billion higher than the 
carrying amount."
"In the post-tax model, this surplus would have been exhausted if the 
calculations had used a discount rate of 7.11 %, a growth rate of 0.04 % or a cash flow of 
€258 million in terminal value."
"In the pre-tax model, this surplus would have been exhausted 
if the calculations had used a discount rate of 9.23 %, a growth rate of – 0.10 % or a cash 
flow of €360 million in terminal value."

"Property, plant and equipment includes legally owned assets as well as right-of-use assets 
from leases of which RWE is the lessee."
"These leases primarily comprise long-term rights of use to leased office buildings and land 
(e."
"leaseholds, properties for green electricity production) and rights of use to leased 
assets relating to vehicle fleets and power plants."
"The following table shows the development of right-of-use assets recognised in property, 
plant and equipment:

"In addition, leases had the following effect on the RWE Group’s income and cash flows in the 
year under review:
In addition to right-of-use assets, property, plant and equipment also include land and 
­
buildings leased as operating leases by RWE as lessor."
"As of 31 December 2023, the 
­
carrying amount of these assets totalled €170 million (previous year: €170 million)."
"­
Moreover, potential lease 
payments predominantly relating to leases of wind farm sites were ­
disregarded when 
valuing lease liabilities."
"This relates to €706 million (previous year: €407 million) in variable 
payments which may come due depending on generation volumes and €332 million 
(previous year: €224 million) in potential payments associated with extension and 
termination options."

"Amprion’s main shareholder is 
a consortium of financial investors."
"KELAG-Kärntner Elektrizitäts-AG, headquartered in Klagenfurt, Austria, is a leading 
­
Austrian energy supplier in the fields of electricity, district heating and natural gas."
"RWE has 
an interest of 49 % in Kärntner Energieholding Beteiligungs GmbH (KEH), KELAG’s largest 
shareholder and also holds 12.85 % of KELAG directly (imputed RWE shareholding of 37.9 %)."
"The RWE Group holds shares with a book value of €3 million (previous year: €3 million) in 
associates and joint ventures, which are subject to temporary restrictions or conditions in 
relation to their distributions of profits, due to conditions in loan agreements."
"Non-current securities amounting to €94 million and €3 million (previous year: ­
 
€118 million and €3 million) were deposited in trust for RWE AG and its subsidiaries, in order 
to cover credit balances stemming from the block model for pre-­
retirement part-time work, 
pursuant to Sec."
"8a of the Pre-Retirement Part-Time Work Act and from the management of 
long-term ­
working hours accounts pursuant to Sec."
"7e of the German Code of Social Law IV, 
­
respectively."
"This coverage applies to the employees of RWE AG as well as to the 
­
employees of Group companies."
"(14)  Financial receivables
RWE is the lessor in finance lease arrangements pursuant to IFRS 16."
"The resulting lease 
receivables are reported in the miscellaneous other financial receivables."
"These are to guarantee that the 
­
obligations from the trans­
actions are discharged even if the development of prices is not 
favourable for RWE."
"Regular replacement of the deposited collateral depends on the 
­
contractually agreed thresholds, above which collateral must be provided for the market 
value of the trading activities."
"€13,691 million and €15,961 million of the total amount 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities, respectively, will be realised within twelve months 
(previous year: €36,819 million and €36,752 million)."
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
"The carrying values 
of exchange-­
traded derivatives with netting agreements are offset."
"(16)  Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities principally stem from the fact that measurements in the 
IFRS statements differ from those in the tax bases."
"The capitalised tax reduction claims from loss carryforwards result from the expected 
­
utilisation of previously unused tax loss carryforwards in subsequent years."
"It is sufficiently 
certain that these tax carryforwards will be realised."
The tax loss carryforwards essentially do not have any time limits.
"It is expected that most of 
the corporate income tax loss carryforwards and trade tax loss ­
carryforwards (or 
comparable foreign local income tax) cannot be utilised."
"As of 31 December 2023, temporary differences for which no deferred tax assets were 
recognised amounted to €11,202 million (previous year: €8,549 million)."
"In the year under review, deferred tax income of €12 million arising from the currency 
translation of foreign financial statements was offset against equity (previous year: deferred 
tax income of €32 million)."
"As in the previous year, this entire amount related to gas 
inventories in the reporting period."
"Inventories amounting to €0 million (previous year: €634 million) were subject to restrictions 
from liens, chattel mortgages or other restrictions."
"(18)  Marketable securities
Current marketable securities include fixed-interest marketable securities totalling 
€7,691 million (previous year: €13,468 million) which predominantly have a maturity of 
more than three months from the date of acquisition."
"Stocks and profit-participation 
­
certificates accounted for €33 million (previous year: €0 million)."

"Upon issuance of the mandatory convertible bond in October 
2022, the amount of said bond of €2,365,138,635 was recognised in equity and 
€62,461,365 was recognised as a financial liability."
"Additionally, transaction costs of €2,183,798 related to the issuance of the mandatory 
convertible bond were offset directly against equity."
"As the conditional capital was mostly utilised in the course of converting the mandatory 
convertible bond, the Annual General Meeting replaced the remaining authorisation with a 
new amount of conditional capital on 4 May 2023."
"According to this resolution, the capital 
stock is conditionally increased by up to €190,423,349.76, divided into up to 74,384,121 
bearer shares."
"This conditional capital increase serves the purpose of granting shares to the 
holders or creditors of convertible and / or option bonds which are issued on the basis of the 
resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023."
"Based on this resolution, 
in the period up to 3 May 2028, convertible and / or option bonds with a total nominal value 
of up to €5,500,000,000 can be issued by the Company or a Group company."
"The 
Executive Board is authorised, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to determine further 
details of implementing conditional capital increases."
"With issuance of the mandatory convertible bond, the scope for the issue of shares without 
subscription rights from the approved capital was also almost completely utilised."
"Consequently, the Annual General Meeting of 4 May 2023 replaced the approved capital 
resolved on 28 April 2021 with a new authorisation."
"In certain cases, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the subscription rights 
of shareholders can be excluded."

from one of the three renowned rating agencies – Moody’s, S & P and Fitch – as well as their 
equity capital and prices for credit default swaps."

"(20)  Equity
A breakdown of fully paid-up equity is shown on pages 126 et seq."
"The subscribed capital of 
RWE AG consists exclusively of common no-par-value bearer shares."
"Based on the authorisation, the 
Executive Board is also authorised to cancel treasury shares without a further resolution by 
the Annual General Meeting."
"Moreover, the Executive Board is authorised to transfer or sell 
such shares to third parties under certain conditions and excluding shareholders’ 
­
subscription rights."
"Furthermore, treasury shares may be issued to holders of option or 
­
convertible bonds under certain conditions."
"The Executive Board is also authorised to use 
the treasury shares to discharge obligations from future employee share schemes; in this 
regard, shareholders’ subscription rights shall be excluded."
"No treasury shares were held as of 31 December 2023, as was also the case at last year’s 
reporting date."
"In fiscal 2023, RWE AG purchased a total of 421,816 RWE shares (previous year: 424,120) 
for a purchase price of €16,137,338.58 on the capital market (previous year: 
€16,794,705.09)."
"This is equivalent to €1,079,848.96 of the capital stock (0.06 % of 
subscribed capital) (previous year: €1,085,747.20 and 0.06 % of subscribed capital)."
"­
Employees of RWE AG and its subsidiaries received a total of 421,816 shares for capital 
formation under the employee share plan (previous year: 424,120)."
"This resulted in total 
proceeds of €15,946,015.68 (previous year: €16,596,862.76)."
"The difference to the 
­
purchase price was offset against freely available retained earnings."
"As of 31 December 2023, the share of accumulated other comprehensive income 
­
attributable to investments accounted for using the equity method amounted to ­
 
– €79 million (previous year: – €35 million)."
"During the reporting year, €19 million in differences from currency translation which had 
originally been recognised without an effect on income were realised as income (previous 
year: €17 million)."
"Dividend proposal
We propose to the Annual General Meeting that RWE AG’s distributable profit for fiscal 
2023 be appropriated as follows: 
Distribution of a dividend of €1.00 per share."

Based on a resolution of RWE AG’s Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023, the dividend for 
fiscal 2022 amounted to €0.90 per dividend-bearing share."
"The dividend payment to 
shareholders of RWE AG amounted to €669 million (previous year: €609 million)."
"Non-controlling interests
The share ownership of third parties in Group entities is presented in this item."
"The expenses associated with these are borne by the Group companies which 
employ the persons holding notional stocks."
The LTIP SPP 2016-2020 was introduced in 2016.
"It uses an internal performance target 
(net income of relevance to remuneration) derived from the mid-term planning and takes 
into account the development of RWE AG’s share price."
"Executives receive conditionally 
granted virtual shares (performance shares)."
"The final number of virtual shares in a tranche 
is determined based on the achievement of the adjusted net income target."
"Each of the 
issued LTIP SPP tranches has a term of four years before payment is possible."
"The plan conditions of the LTIP SPP were adjusted and extended for grants starting from 
­
fiscal 2021."
"These three success factors determine how many of the 
­
conditionally granted performance shares are finally granted at the end of the performance 
period."
The performance period was extended from the previous one year to three years.
"Once it ends, all three success factors will be given equal weight in calculating the final 
grant."
"Thereafter, the performance shares must be held for a further year."
"Therefore, the 
vesting period will still be four years."
"Dividends do not 
bear interest and are not reinvested."
"If a dividend payment occurs during the 30-day period for calculating the share price in accordance with item a), the share prices of the 
trading days leading up to the payment (CUM share prices) are adjusted by the dividend, as the dividend would otherwise be considered twice."
Payment amount = (number of finally granted performance shares) x (mathematical average of the share price + dividends paid).
The payment amount calculated in this manner is limited to no more than 200 % of the grant amount.

"The limited payment per SPP 
was implemented via a sold call option."
"The option value calculated using the Black Scholes 
Model was deducted."
"The maximum payments per conditionally granted SPP (= option 
strike) established in the plan conditions, the discount rates relative to the remaining term 
as well as the volatilities and expected dividends of RWE AG were considered in determining 
the option price."
"Multivariate Monte Carlo simulations were used for the valuation of RWE AG’s 2021 tranche 
of the SPP."
"In this context, the success factors not dependent on the capital market were 
taken as the best estimators without variability."

‘Change’ pertains to the final grant based on target achievement or the subsequent grant  
or lapse of performance shares."
"For the SPP options exercised in the period under review, the average weighted daily share 
price on the day of exercise was €39.89."
€41 million is payable for the 2020 tranche.
"During the period under review, expenses for the share-based ­
payment system totalled 
€46 million (previous year: €43 million)."
"As of the balance-sheet date, provisions for cash-
settled share-­
based payment programmes amounted to €102 million (previous year: 
€94 million)."
"In the consolidated financial 
­
statements, the contributions are thus recognised analogously to a defined contribution 
plan, although this is a defined benefit plan."
"The pension plan for employees in the 
­
Netherlands is administered by Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP (see www.abp.nl)."
"Contributions 
to the pension plan are calculated as a percentage rate of employees’ salaries and are paid 
by the employees and employers."
The rate of the contributions is determined by ABP.
"There 
are no minimum funding obligations."
"Approximately €13 million in employer contributions 
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations."
"The company pension plan consists of 
defined contribution and defined benefit plans."
"The defined benefit commitments mainly 
relate to pension benefits based on final salary."
"These are exposed to the typical risks of 
­
longevity, inflation and salary increases."
"In the reporting period, €49 million (previous year: €36 million) was paid into defined 
­
contribution plans."
"This includes payments made by RWE for a benefit plan in the 
­
Netherlands which covers the commitments of various employers."
The contributions are used for all of the beneficiaries.
"If 
ABP’s funds are insufficient, it can either curtail pension benefits and future post-
employment benefits, or increase the contributions of the employer and employees."
"In the 
event that RWE terminates the ABP pension plan, ABP will charge a termination fee."
"Amongst other things, its level depends on the number of participants in the plan, the 
amount of salary and the age structure of the participants."
"As of 31 December 2023, we 
had around 690 active participants in the plan (previous year: approximately 550)."
RWE transferred assets to RWE Pensionstreuhand e.V.
"within the framework of a contractual 
trust arrangement (CTA) in order to finance the pension commitments of German Group 
companies."
There is no obligation to provide further funds.
"From the assets held in trust, 
funds were transferred to RWE Pensionsfonds AG to cover pension commitments to most of 
the employees who have already retired."
"RWE Pensionsfonds AG falls under the scope of the 
Act on the Supervision of Insurance Undertakings and oversight by the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Agency (BaFin)."
"Insofar as a regulatory deficit occurs in the pension fund, 
­
supplementary payment shall be requested from the employer."
"Independently of the 
­
aforementioned rules, the liability of the employer shall remain in place."
"The boards of RWE 
­
Pensionstreuhand e.V."
"and RWE Pensionsfonds AG are responsible for ensuring that the 
funds under management are used in compliance with the contract and thus fulfil the 
requirements for recognition as plan assets."
"In the United Kingdom, it is legally mandated that defined benefit plans are provided with 
adequate and suitable assets to cover pension obligations."
"The corporate pension system is 
managed by the sector-wide Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS)."
"There are two 
­
dedicated, independent sections: the RWE Section and the Innogy Section."
"The sections are 
managed by trustees which are elected by members of the pension plans or appointed by 
the sponsoring employers."
The trustees are responsible for managing the pension plans.
"This includes investments, pension payments and financing plans."
"The pension plans 
­
comprise the benefit obligations and plan assets for the subsidiaries of the RWE Group."
"It is 
required by law to assess the required financing of the pension plans once every three years 
in compliance with the UK regulations for pensions (a so-called funding valuation)."
"This 
involves measuring pension obligations on the basis of conservative assumptions, which 
deviate from the requirements imposed by IFRS."
"The underlying actuarial assumptions 
­
primarily include the projected life expectancies of the members of the pension plans as well 
as assumptions relating to inflation, imputed interest rates and the market returns on the 
plan assets."
The last funding valuation for the RWE Section occurred as at 31 March 2022.
"The 
valuation did not find a financing deficit."
"The next funding valuation must occur by 
31 March 2025."
"For the Innogy Section, the last funding ­
valuation as at 31 March 2021 did 
not reveal a financing deficit."
The next funding valuation must occur by 31 March 2024.
"The payments to settle a financing deficit that is identified are charged to the participating 
companies on the basis of a contractual agreement."
"Above and beyond this, payments are 
regularly made to finance the newly arising benefit obligations of active employees which 
increase the pension claims."
Provisions for defined benefit plans are determined using actuarial methods.

"Our investment policy in Germany is based on a detailed analysis of the plan assets and the 
pension commitments and the relation of these two items to each other, in order to determine 
the best possible investment strategy (Asset Liability Management Study)."
"Using an 
­
optimisation process, portfolios are identified which can earn the best targeted results at a 
defined level of risk."
"One of these efficient portfolios is selected and the strategic asset 
­
allocation is determined; furthermore, the related risks are analysed in detail."
"The focus of RWE’s strategic investment policy is on domestic and foreign government 
bonds."
"In order to increase the average yield, corporate bonds with a higher yield are also 
included in the portfolio."
The ratio of equities in the portfolio is lower than that of bonds.
Investment occurs in various regions.
"The investment position in equities is intended to earn 
a risk premium over bond investments over the long term."
"Furthermore, in order to achieve 
consistently high returns, there is also investment in products which are more likely to offer 
relatively regular positive returns over time."
"In the United Kingdom, our capital investment takes account of the structure of the pension 
obligations as well as liquidity and risk matters."
"The goal of the investment strategy in this context is 
to maintain the level of pension plan funding and ensure the full financing of the pension plans over 
time."
"To reduce financing costs and earn surplus returns, we also include higher-risk investments in 
our portfolio."
The capital investment focusses on government and corporate bonds.
"Pension provisions for pension commitments changed as follows:
1	 Of which: €73 million in cash flows from operating activities."
2	 Contained in cash flows from operating activities.
2	 Contained in cash flows from operating activities.
"As of the balance-sheet date, the recognised amount of pension provisions totalled 
€880 million for funded pension plans (previous year: €462 million) and €444 million for 
unfunded pension plans (previous year: €438 million)."
Part of the past service cost related to severance payments in the UK.
"Actual developments will probably be different than 
this."
"The methods of calculating the aforementioned sensitivities and for calculating the 
pension provisions are in agreement."
"The dependence of pension provisions on market 
interest rates is limited by an opposite effect."
"The background of this is that the ­
commitments 
stemming from company pension plans are primarily covered by funds, and mostly plan 
assets exhibit negative correlation with the market yields of fixed-­
interest securities."
"­
Consequently, declines in market interest rates are typically reflected in an increase in plan 
assets, whereas rising market interest rates are typically reflected in a reduction in plan 
assets."
"Additionally, some commitments grant annual 
adjustments of pensions, which may exceed the adjustments in compliance with the legally 
mandated adjustment obligation."
"Due to the currently high level of inflation, future pension 
adjustments in Germany are projected to be higher than the long-term trend assumed in 
the calculations."
"Some domestic pension plans guarantee a certain pension level, taking into account the 
statutory pension (total retirement earnings schemes)."
"As a result, future reductions in the 
statutory pension can result in higher pension payments by RWE."
"As a result, the real average discount rate used for nuclear waste 
management purposes, which is the difference between the average discount rate and the 
average escalation rate, amounted to 0.0 % (previous year: – 0.1 %)."
"An increase (decrease) 
in this rate by 0.1 percentage point would reduce (increase) the present value of the 
­
provision by roughly €30 million."
"The additions to provisions for nuclear waste management in the amount of €80 million are 
mainly based on inflation-driven increases in the provisions as well as updates of the cost 
estimates."
"In the reporting period, we also used provisions of €438 million for the 
decommissioning of nuclear power plants."
"Provisions for nuclear waste disposal are almost exclusively reported as non-current 
­
provisions, and their settlement amount is discounted to the balance-sheet date."
"Based on 
the current state of planning, these provisions will essentially be used by the beginning of the 
2040s."
"In fiscal 2024, RWE expects to make €140 million in payments for defined benefit plans 
(previous-year target: €45 million), as direct benefits and contributions to plan assets."
"Interest accretion increased the provisions for nuclear 
waste management by €88 million, of which – €57 million was offset with the corresponding 
costs for the Borssele nuclear power plant."
"The provisions of the law on the reassignment of responsibility for nuclear waste disposal 
stipulate that accountability for the shutdown and dismantling of the assets in Germany as 
well as for packaging radio­
active waste remains with the companies."
"The shutdown and 
­
dismantling process encompasses all activities following the final termination of production 
by the nuclear power plant until the plant site is removed from the regulatory scope of the 
Nuclear Energy Act."
"A request to decommission and dismantle the nuclear power plant will 
be filed with the nuclear licensing authority during its operating period so that the 
­
decommissioning and dismantling work can be performed in time after the expiry of the 
operating permit."
"Dismantling operations essentially consist of dismantling and removal of 
the radioactive contamination from the facilities and structures, radiation protection and 
regulatory monitoring of the dismantling measures and residual operations."
"We thus subdivide our provisions for nuclear waste management into the residual operation 
of nuclear power plants, the dismantling of nuclear power station facilities as well as the cost 
of residual material processing and radioactive waste treatment facilities."
"In addition to works monitoring and facility protection, these mainly include service, 
recurrent audits, maintenance, radiation and fire protection as well as infrastructural 
adjustments."
"Provisions for the dismantling of nuclear power plant facilities include all work done to 
­
dismantle plants, parts of plants, systems and components as well as on buildings that must 
be dismantled to comply with the Nuclear Energy Act."
"They also consider the conventional 
dismantling of nuclear power plant facilities to fulfil legal or other obligations."
"Provisions for residual material processing and waste management include the costs of 
processing radioactive residual material for non-hazardous recycling and the costs of 
­
treating radioactive waste produced during the plant’s service life and dismantling 
­
operations."
"This item also 
contains the cost of transporting the waste produced by recycling and of the proper 
­
packaging of spent nuclear fuel elements, i."
"the cost of procuring and loading freight and 
interim storage containers."
"Commissioned by the plant operator, the international company Siempelkamp NIS 
­
Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH, Alzenau, assesses the prospective costs of residual operation 
and dismantling of the nuclear power plants on an annual basis."
"The costs are determined 
specifically for each facility and take into consideration the current state of the art, 
­
regulatory requirements and previous practical experience from ongoing and completed 
dismantling projects."
"Additionally, current developments are also incorporated into the cost 
calculations."
"They also include the cost of conditioning and packaging low-level and 
intermediate-level radioactive waste and the transportation of such to BGZ."
"­
Further cost 
estimates for the disposal of radioactive waste are based on contracts with ­
foreign 
reprocessing companies and other disposal companies."
"Furthermore, the cost ­
estimates 
are based on plans by internal and external experts."
"Provisions for the residual operation of nuclear power station ­
facilities cover all steps that 
must be taken largely independent of dismantling and disposal but are necessary to ensure 
that the assets are safe and in compliance with permits or are required by the authorities."
"They are reported at 
their settlement amount discounted to the balance-sheet date."
"The cost estimates are 
based on contracts as well as information from internal and external expert specialists."
"In discounting the amounts used in the coming 30 years, we have oriented ourselves 
towards the current market interest rates for risk-free cash investments."
"Since no market 
interest rates are available for later periods, a sustainable, long-term interest rate is used to 
discount the amounts used after the next 30 years."
"The average discount rate was 3.0 % 
(previous year: 3.2 %)."
"The majority of the provisions pertains to claims that are expected to 
materialise over the next 30 years."
"The average escalation rate based on current inflation 
expectations was 2.0 % (previous year: 2.2 %)."
"As a result, the real average discount rate 
applied for mining purposes, which is the difference between the average discount rate and 
the average escalation rate, amounted to 1.0 % (previous year: 1.0 %)."
"A decline of 0.1 percentage point in the real discount rate would increase the present value 
of the provision by around €135 million, while an increase of 0.1 percentage point would 
reduce the present value by around €125 million."
"In the reporting period, additions to provisions for mining damage amounted to 
€389 million, of which €25 million was capitalised in the item ‘property, plant and 
equipment’."
"The additions are mainly based on an inflation-driven increase in the obligatory 
volume and updates of the cost estimates."
"The interest accretion increased provisions for 
mining damage by €252 million, of which €1 million was offset in ‘property, plant and 
equipment’."
"The provision for obligations which are not yet contractually defined covers the costs of the 
remaining operational phase, the costs of dismantling as well as the residual material 
processing and waste treatment costs subject to future contractual agreement."
"Provisions for contractually defined nuclear obligations relate to all obligations the value of 
which is specified in contracts under civil law."
"The obligations include the anticipated 
­
residual costs of reprocessing and returning the resulting radioactive waste."
"These costs 
stem from existing contracts with foreign reprocessing companies and with the company 
Gesellschaft für Nuklear-Service mbH (GNS)."
"Moreover, these provisions also include the 
costs for transport and intermediate storage containers for and the loading of spent fuel 
assemblies within the framework of final direct storage."
"Furthermore, this item also includes 
the volumes of the orders for the professional packaging of low-level and medium-level 
waste as well as the in-house personnel costs incurred for the decommissioning of plants."
"Based on current estimates, we expect most of these 
to be used from 2024 to 2025."
"Provisions for restructuring obligations pertain mainly to measures for socially ­
acceptable 
payroll downsizing."
We currently expect the majority of these to be used from 2024 to 2034.
"In so doing, sums ear-marked for personnel measures are reclassified from provisions for 
restructuring obligations to provisions for staff-related obligations as soon as the underlying 
restructuring measure has been specified."
"This is the case if individual contracts governing 
socially acceptable payroll downsizing are signed by affected employees."
Provisions for purchase and sales obligations primarily relate to onerous contracts.
"From the current perspective, we expect that the majority of the provisions for the 
­
dismantling of wind and solar farms will be used from 2024 to 2052, and the provisions 
for other dismantling and retrofitting obligations will be used from 2024 to 2060."
"For the first bond with maturity in 2029, the yield-to-maturity

€0 million of the financial liabilities are secured by mortgages (previous year: €15 million).
Other financial liabilities contain lease liabilities.
"(24)  Income tax liabilities
Income tax liabilities contain uncertain income tax items in the amount of €552 million 
­
(previous year: €860 million)."
"This item primarily includes income taxes for periods for which 
the tax authorities have not yet finalised a tax assessment, including the current year."
"Miscellaneous other liabilities contain €129 million in contract liabilities (previous year: 
€224 million)."
"Moreover, €62 million (previous year: €77 million) in miscellaneous other liabilities were 
­
allocable to investment-related government grants primarily granted in connection with the 
construction of wind farms."
"(27)  Reporting on financial instruments
Financial instruments are divided into non-derivative and derivative."
"Non-derivative 
­
financial assets essentially include other non-current financial assets, accounts receivable, 
marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents."
"Financial instruments are recognised 
either at amortised cost or at fair value, depending on their classification."
"Financial instruments are recognised in the following categories:
•	 Debt instruments measured at amortised cost: the contractual cash flows solely consist 
of interest and principal on the outstanding capital; there is an intention to hold the 
­
financial instrument until maturity."
"•	 Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: the 
­
contractual cash flows solely consist of interest and principal on the outstanding capital; 
there is an intention to hold and sell the financial instrument."
"•	 Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: the 
option to recognise changes in fair value directly in equity is exercised."
"On the liabilities side, non-derivative financial instruments principally include liabilities 
measured at amortised cost."
"Financial instruments recognised at fair value are measured based on the published 
exchange price, insofar as the financial instruments are traded on an active market."
"The fair 
value of non-quoted debt and equity instruments is generally determined on the basis of 
discounted expected cash flows, taking into consideration macro-economic developments 
and corporate business plan data."
"Current market interest rates corresponding to the 
remaining maturity are used for discounting."
"1	 
Dividend proposal for fiscal 2023, subject to the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2024."
"Exchange-traded products are 
­
measured using the published closing prices of the relevant exchange."
"Non-exchange 
traded products are measured on the basis of publicly available broker quotations or, if such 
quotations are not available, on generally accepted valuation methods."
"In doing so, we draw 
on prices on active markets as much as possible."
"If such prices are not available, ­
company-­
specific planning estimates are used in the measurement process."
"These ­
estimates 
encompass all of the market factors which other market participants would take into 
account in the course of price determination."
"Assumptions pertaining to the energy sector 
and economy are made within the scope of a comprehensive process with the involvement 
of both in-house and external experts."
"Measurement of the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is 
­
conducted on the basis of the net risk exposure per business partner."
"The following overview presents the classifications of financial instruments measured at fair 
value in the fair value hierarchy prescribed by IFRS 13."
"as price) 
or indirectly (i."
"derived from prices),
•	 Level 3: Measurement using factors which cannot be observed on the basis of market data."
1	 Some prior-year figures restated.
"Level 3 derivative financial instruments essentially consist of energy purchase and 
­
commodity agreements, which relate to trading periods for which there are no active 
­
markets yet."
"The valuation of such depends on the development of electricity, oil and gas 
prices in particular."
"All other things being equal, rising market prices cause the fair values to 
increase, whereas declining gas prices cause them to drop."
"A change in pricing by + / – 10 % 
would cause the market value to rise by €196 million (previous year: €23 million) or decline 
by €196 million (previous year: €23 million)."
The only deviations are for financial liabilities.
"The carrying 
amount of these is €15,115 million (previous year: €19,438 million), while the fair value 
amounts to €14,902 million (previous year: €18,830 million)."
"Of this, €6,357 million 
(previous year: €5,059 million) is related to Level 1 and €8,545 million (previous year: 
€13,771 million) to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy."
"The net result as per IFRS 7 essentially includes interest, dividends and results from the 
measurement of financial instruments at fair value."
"The option to recognise changes in fair value in other comprehensive income is exercised 
for a portion of the ­
investments in equity instruments."
"These are strategic investments and 
other long-term investments."
"In fiscal 2023, €202 million (previous year: €194 million) in income from dividends from 
these financial instruments was recognised."
"The netted financial assets and liabilities essentially consist of collateral 
for stock market transactions due on a daily basis."
"As an energy producer with international operations, the RWE Group is exposed to market, 
credit and liquidity risks in its ordinary business activity."
"We limit these risks via systematic, 
groupwide risk management."
"The range of action, responsibilities and controls are defined 
in binding internal directives."
"Market risks stem from changes in exchange rates and share prices as well as interest 
rates and commodity prices, which can have an influence on business results."
"Due to the RWE Group’s international profile, currency management is a key issue."
"Fuels are 
traded in British pounds and US dollars as well as in other currencies."
"In addition, RWE does 
business in a number of currency areas."
"The companies of the RWE Group are required to 
hedge their foreign currency risks via RWE AG."
"Foreign currency risks arising from the 
involvement in and the financing of the renewable energy business are hedged by 
RWE Renewables International Participations B.V."
"Interest rate risks stem primarily from financial debt and the Group’s interest-bearing 
investments."
"We hedge against negative changes in value caused by unexpected ­
interest-
rate movements using non-derivative and derivative financial instruments."
"Opportunities and risks from changes in the values of non-current securities are centrally 
controlled by a professional fund management system operated by RWE AG."
"The Group’s other financial transactions are recorded using centralised risk management 
software and monitored by RWE AG."
"For commodity operations, risk management directives have been established by RWE AG’s 
Controlling & Risk Management Department."
"These regulations stipulate that derivatives 
may be used to hedge price risks."
"Furthermore, commodity derivatives may be traded, 
­
subject to limits."
Compliance with limits is monitored daily.
"Risks stemming from fluctuations in commodity prices and financial market risks (foreign 
currency risks, interest rate risks, securities risks) are monitored and managed by RWE using 
indicators such as the Value at Risk (VaR) and sensitivities, amongst other things."
"In ­
addition, 
for the management of interest rate risk, a Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR) is determined."
"Using the VaR method, RWE determines and monitors the maximum expected loss arising from 
changes in market prices with a specific level of probability during specific periods."
"­
Historical 
price volatility is taken as a basis in the calculations."
"With the exception of the CFaR data, all 
VaR figures are based on a confidence interval of 95 % and a holding period of one day."
"For the 
CFaR, a confidence interval of 95 % and a holding period of one year is taken as a basis."
"In respect of interest rate risks, RWE distinguishes between two risk categories: on the one 
hand, increases in interest rates can result in declines in the prices of securities from the 
holdings of RWE."
This pertains primarily to fixed-rate instruments.
"Price risk is measured 
using sensitivity analysis in relation to an interest rate change of 100 basis points."
"As of the 
balance-sheet date, it amounted to €22.3 million (previous year: €35.6 million)."
"On the 
other hand, financing costs also increase along with the level of interest rates."
"The sensitivity 
of interest expenses to increases in market interest rates is measured with the CFaR."
"As of 
31 December 2023 this amounted to €43.6 million (previous year: €86.1 million)."
"RWE 
­
calculates the CFaR based on the assumption of the refinancing of maturing debt."
"Risks related to financial positions in foreign currency are also measured using sensitivity 
analysis, which shows the impact on the value of the position stemming from a 10 % change 
in the exchange rate."
"As of 31 December 2023, this sensitivity was €0.4 million (previous 
year: €0.7 million)."

The price risk of equities in RWE’s portfolio is also measured using sensitivity analysis."
"As of 
the balance-sheet date, this analysis yielded the following results (before taxes): In the event 
of a 10 % rise in the relevant share prices, equity would increase by €480 million (previous 
year: €370 million) and income by €2 million (previous year: €4 million)."
"In the event of a 
10 % fall in the relevant share prices, equity would decrease by €480 million (previous year: 
€370 million) and income by €2 million (previous year: €4 million)."
"The key internal control parameters for commodity positions at RWE Supply & Trading are 
the VaR for the trading business and the VaR for the pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
business."
"Here, the maximum VaR is €60 million and €40 million, respectively."
"As of 
31 December 2023, the VaR was €7.2 million in the trading business (previous year: 
€12.4 million) and €7.5 million for the pooled gas and LNG business (previous year: 
€27.5 million)."
"Additionally, stress tests are carried out on a monthly basis in ­
relation to the trading and 
pooled LNG and gas business of RWE Supply & Trading to model the impact of commodity 
price ­
changes on the earnings conditions and take risk-mitigating measures if necessary."
"In 
these stress tests, market price curves are modified, and the commodity position is revalued 
on this basis."
"Historical scenarios of ­
extreme prices and realistic, fictitious price scenarios 
are modelled."
"In the event that the stress tests exceed internal ­
thresholds, these scenarios 
are then analysed in detail in relation to their impact and probability, and – if necessary – 
risk-mitigating measures are considered."
"Commodity risks of the Group’s power generation companies ­
are managed by the 
­
Commodity Management Committee (CMC) and hedged by RWE Supply & Trading on the 
basis of available market liquidity in accordance with the guidelines from the ­
Commodity 
Strategy Group."
"In accordance with the approach for long-term investments for example, it is 
not possible to manage commodity risks from long-term positions or positions which cannot 
be hedged due to their size and the prevailing market liquidity using the VaR concept."
"As a 
result, these positions are not included in the VaR figures."
"Above and beyond open production 
positions which have not ­
yet been transferred, Group companies are not allowed to maintain 
significant risk positions, according to a Group guideline."
"Furthermore, commodity price risks 
may exist in the gas storage business."
"The subsidiaries that own the gas storage facilities 
manage their positions independently, in compliance with unbundling regulations."
"One of our most important instruments to limit market risk is the conclusion of hedging 
transactions."
"The instruments most commonly used are forwards and options with foreign 
currency, interest rate swaps, interest rate currency swaps, equity derivatives and forwards, 
options, futures and swaps with commodities."
"Maturities of derivatives related to interest rates, currencies, equity, indices and commodities 
for the purpose of hedging are based on the maturities of the underlying transactions and 
are thus primarily short term and medium term in nature."
"Hedges of the foreign currency risks 
of foreign investments have maturities of up to eight years."
"All derivative financial instruments within the scope of IFRS 9 are recognised as assets or 
­
liabilities and are measured at fair value."
"When interpreting their positive and negative fair values, 
it should be taken into account that, with the exception of trading in commodities, these financial 
instruments are generally matched with underlying transactions that carry offsetting risks."
"Hedge accounting pursuant to IFRS 9 is used primarily for mitigating currency risks from 
net investments in foreign functional currencies, commodity market price risks, interest risks 
from non-current liabilities, and currency and price risks from sales and purchase transactions."
"Cash flow hedges are primarily used to hedge against interest risks from non-current 
­
liabilities as well as currency and price risks from sales and purchase transactions."
"Hedging 
instruments consist of forwards, swaps and options with foreign currency and interest rates, 
and forwards, futures and swaps with commodities."
"Changes in the fair value of the hedging 
instruments – insofar as they affect the effective portion – are recorded in other 
­
comprehensive income until the underlying transaction is realised."
"The ineffective portion of 
changes in value is recognised in profit or loss."
"When hedging commodities, underlying and 
hedging transactions are based on the same price index."
"This generally does not result in

ineffectiveness."
"When hedging foreign currency risks, ineffectiveness can result from the 
­
difference in timing between the origination of the hedged item and the hedging instrument."
"Ineffectiveness can likewise stem from hedges containing material foreign currency basis 
spreads."
"Upon realisation of the underlying trans­
action, the hedge’s contribution to income 
from accumulated other comprehensive income is recognised on the income statement or 
is offset against the initial value recognition of an asset or a liability."

"Hedged items and hedging instruments are constantly adjusted based on changes 
in market prices, market liquidity and the sales business with consumers."
"Commodity prices 
are hedged if this leads to a positive margin."
"Proprietary commodities trading is strictly 
­
separated from this when managing risks."
"Hedges of net investment in a foreign operation are used to hedge the foreign currency risks 
of net investment in foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro."
"We use 
­
interest rate currency swaps and other currency derivatives as hedging instruments."
"If there 
are changes in the fair value of interest rate currency swaps, the amount of the effective 
portion is recorded under foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive 
income."
"The forward and spot elements of the hedging instruments used in net investment hedges 
are sometimes treated separately and only the value of the spot element is designated."
"In these cases, the fair value change of the forward element (hedging costs) is recognised in 
other comprehensive income to the extent that the fair value change relates to the hedged 
net investment."
"Moreover, the fair value of the forward element as of the time of designation 
is amortised over the duration of the hedging instrument using the straight-line method and 
recognised in profit or loss."
"1	 1 The net nominal amount stated is made up of purchases in the amount of €16,430 million and sales in the amount of – €21,616 million."
"The amounts realised from other comprehensive 
income are recognised in the items ‘revenue’ and ‘cost of materials’, whereas any 
­
ineffectiveness is recognised in ‘other operating income’ and ‘other operating expenses’."
"Amounts recognised and any ­
ineffectiveness of hedging interest risks are recognised in 
‘financial income’ and ‘finance costs’ on the income statement."
"In the fields of finance and commodities, RWE primarily has credit relationships 
with banks that have good creditworthiness and other trading partners with predominantly 
good creditworthiness."
"At the same time, due to its growth strategy of developing 
renewables, RWE has credit relationships with suppliers which have widely varying levels of 
creditworthiness."
"RWE mitigates the related risks by establishing limits which are adjusted 
during the business relationships if the creditworthiness of the business partners changes."
"Furthermore, RWE is exposed to credit risks due to the possibility of customers failing to 
fulfil their payment or peformance obligations as agreed, resulting in additional costs."
"We 
identify these risks by conducting regular analyses of the creditworthiness of our customers 
and initiate countermeasures if necessary."
"Persistently high energy prices, inflation and higher interest rates continue to weigh on the 
economic ­
situation of many companies, and RWE’s business partners, competitors and 
customers may be impacted by the consequences of these developments."
"RWE is thus 
carefully monitoring critical branches of the economy and exercising greater caution when 
­
conducting new transactions or extending existing ones."
"If necessary, previously approved 
limits are being lowered."
"Amongst other things, RWE demands guarantees, cash collateral and other forms of 
­
security in order to mitigate credit risks."
"To a more limited degree, RWE also concludes credit 
insurance ­
policies to protect against defaults."
"Bank guarantees received as collateral are 
from ­
financial institutions with the required good ratings."
"Collateral for credit insurance is 
pledged by insurers with an investment-grade rating."
"The maximum balance-sheet default risk is derived from the carrying amounts of the 
­
financial assets stated on the balance sheet."
"The default risks for derivatives correspond to 
their positive fair values."
"Risks can also stem from financial guarantees and loan

commitments which we have to fulfil vis-à-vis external creditors in the event of a default of a 
certain debtor."
"As of 31 December 2023, these obligations amounted to €1,123 million 
(previous year: €2,161 million)."
"As of 31 December 2023, default risks were balanced 
against credit collateral, financial guarantees, bank guarantees and other collaterals 
amounting to €9.3 billion (previous year: €7.5 billion)."
"Of this, €1.4 billion relates to trade 
receivables (previous year: €1.0 billion), €1.2 billion to derivatives used for hedging purposes 
(previous year: €1.1 billion) and €6.7 billion to other derivatives (previous year: €5.4 billion)."
There were no material defaults in fiscal 2023 or the previous year.
"In the RWE Group, the risk provision for financial assets is determined on the basis of 
expected credit losses."
"These are determined on the basis of the probability of default, loss 
given default and the exposure at default."
"We determine the probability of default and loss 
given default using historical data and forward-looking information."
"The exposure at default 
date for financial assets is the gross carrying amount on the balance-sheet date."
"The 
expected credit loss for financial assets determined on this basis corresponds to the 
­
difference between the contractually agreed payments and the payments expected by 
RWE, ­
discounted by the original effective interest rate."
"The assignment to one of the levels 
described below influences the level of the expected losses and the effective interest ­
income 
recognised."
"•	 Stage 1 – Expected 12-month credit losses: At initial recognition, financial assets are 
generally assigned to this stage – with the exception of those that have been purchased 
or originated credit impaired, which are thus considered separately."
"The level of 
­
impairment results from the cash flows expected for the entire term of the financial 
instrument, multiplied by the probability of a default within 12 months from the reporting 
date."
"The effective interest rate used for measurement is determined on the basis of the 
carrying amount before impairment (gross)."
"•	 Stage 2 – Lifetime expected credit losses (gross): ­
If the credit risk has risen significantly 
between initial recognition and the reporting date, the financial instrument is assigned to 
this stage."
"Unlike Stage 1, default events expected beyond the 12-month period from the 
reporting date are also considered in calculating the impairment."
"The effective interest 
rate used for measurement is still determined on the basis of the carrying amount before 
impairment (gross)."
"•	 Stage 3 – Lifetime expected credit losses (net): If in addition to the criteria for Stage 2 
there is an objective indication of an impairment, the financial asset is assigned to Stage 3."
The impairment is calculated analogously to Stage 2.
"In this case, however, the effective 
interest rate used for measurement is applied to the carrying amount after impairment 
(net)."
"For debt instruments for which there has been no significant rise in credit risk since initial 
recognition, a risk provision is recognised in the amount of the expected 12-month credit 
losses (Stage 1)."
"In addition, a financial instrument is assigned to Stage 1 of the impairment 
model if the absolute credit risk is low on the balance-sheet date."
"The credit risk is classified as low if the debtor’s internal or external rating is ­
investment-
grade."
"For trade accounts receivable, the risk provision corresponds to the ­
lifetime expected 
credit losses (Stage 2)."
"To determine whether a financial instrument is assigned to Stage 2 of the impairment 
model, it must be determined whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial 
recognition."
"To make this assessment, we consider quantitative and qualitative information 
supported by our experience and assumptions regarding future developments."
"In so doing, 
special importance is accorded to the sector in which the RWE Group’s debtors are active."
"Our experience is based on studies and data from financial analysts and government 
authorities, amongst others."
"Special attention is paid to the following developments:
•	 significant deterioration of the internal or external rating of the financial instrument,
•	 unfavourable changes in risk indicators, e."
"credit spreads or debtor-related credit 
default swaps,
•	 negative development of the debtor’s regulatory, technological or economic environment,
•	 danger of an unfavourable development of business resulting in a significant reduction in 
­
operating income."
"Independent thereof, a significant rise in credit risk and thus an assignment of the financial 
instrument to Stage 2 are assumed if the contractually agreed payments are more than 
30 days overdue and there is no information that contradicts the assumption of a payment 
default."
"We draw conclusions about the potential default of a counterparty from information from 
internal credit risk management."
"If internal or external information indicates that the 
­
counterparty cannot fulfil its obligations, the associated receivables are classified as 
­
unrecoverable and assigned to Stage 3 of the impairment model."
"Examples of such 
­
information are:
•	 The debtor of the receivable has apparent financial difficulties."
•	 The debtor has already committed a breach of contract by missing or delaying payments.
•	 Concessions already had to be made to the debtor.
•	 An insolvency or another restructuring procedure is impending.
•	 The market for the financial asset is no longer active.
"•	 A sale is only possible at a high discount, which reflects the debtor’s reduced 
­
creditworthiness."
"A payment default and an associated assignment of the financial asset to Stage 3 is also 
assumed if the contractually agreed payments are more than 90 days overdue and there is 
no information disproving the assumption of a payment default."
"Based on our experience, 
we generally assume that this assumption does not apply to trade accounts receivable."
"A financial asset is impaired if there are indications that the counterparty is in serious 
­
financial difficulty and the situation is unlikely to improve."
"We may also take legal recourse 
and other measures in order to enforce the contractually agreed payments in the event of 
an impairment."
"In the RWE Group, there are no cases where a risk provision for trade accounts receivable 
was not recognised due to the collateral on the books."
"As a rule, RWE Group companies refinance with RWE AG."
"In this regard, there 
is a risk that liquidity reserves will prove to be insufficient to meet financial obligations in a 
timely manner."
"In 2024, liabilities owed to banks of €2.2 billion (previous year: €5.9 billion) 
are due."
"Above and beyond this, commercial paper in the amount of €0.2 billion matures in 
2024 (previous year: €2.4 billion)."
"As of 31 December 2023, holdings of cash and cash equivalents and current marketable 
securities amounted to €14,641 million (previous year: €20,456 million)."
The volume of RWE AG’s credit line amounts to €10 billion.
"It consists of three tranches: A 
and B, which run until April 2026 (with volumes of €3 billion and €2 billion, respectively) and 
C, which runs until July 2025 at the latest (with a volume of €5 billion)."
"RWE AG has two 
commercial paper programmes for short-term refinancing."
"The European commercial 
paper programme allows for issuance up to a maximum amount of €5 billion (previous year: 
€5 billion), while the US commercial paper programme allows for issuance up to a maximum 
amount of US$ 3 billion."
"As of the balance-sheet date, €0.2 billion of the European 
programme was used (previous year: €2.4 billion); the US commercial paper programme 
was not used."
"Above and beyond this, RWE AG can finance itself using a €10 billion debt 
issuance programme; as of the balance-sheet date, outstanding bonds from this 
programme amounted to €6.70 billion (previous year: €5.10 billion) at RWE AG."
"Accordingly, 
the RWE Group’s medium-term liquidity risk can be classified as low."
"Additionally, Group companies have provided 
loan commitments to third-party companies amounting to €67 million (previous year: 
€63 million), which are callable in 2024."
"Detailed information on the risks of the RWE Group and on the objectives and procedures of 
the risk management is presented on page 62 et seqq."
in the review of operations.
"(28)  Contingent receivables, contingent liabilities and financial commitments
As of 31 December 2023, the amount of contractual commitments totalled €8,063 million 
(previous year: €5,651 million)."
"This mainly consisted of investment in property, plant and 
equipment."
"We have made long-term contractual purchase commitments for supplies of fuels, ­
including 
natural gas in particular."
"Payment obligations stemming from the major long-term 
purchase contracts amounted to €3.9 billion as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: 
€4.5 billion), of which €0.1 billion is due within one year (previous year: €0.3 billion)."
Gas purchases by the RWE Group are partially based on long-term take-or-pay contracts.
"The conditions in these contracts, which have terms up to 2042 in some cases, are 
­
renegotiated by the contractual partners at certain intervals, which may result in changes in 
the reported payment obligations."
"Calculation of the payment obligations resulting from the 
purchase contracts is based on parameters from the internal planning."
"Furthermore, RWE has long-term financial commitments for purchases of electricity."
"As of 
31 December 2023, the minimum payment obligations stemming from the major purchase 
contracts totalled €5.6 billion (previous year: €7.2 billion), of which €0.3 billion is due within 
one year (previous year: €0.6 billion)."
"Above and beyond this, there are also purchase and 
service contracts for uranium, conversion, enrichment and fabrication."
"In December 2023, RWE reached an agreement with the Swedish energy group Vattenfall 
on the acquisition of three offshore wind projects off the coast of Norfolk in East Anglia."
"The 
transaction is to be completed in spring 2024, as soon as all official approvals are obtained."
The price is based on an enterprise value of £963 million.
"We bear legal and contractual liability from our membership in various associations which 
exist in connection with power plant projects, profit- and loss-transfer agreements, and for 
the provision of liability cover for nuclear risks, amongst others."
"RWE AG has a 36.927 % contractual 
share in the liability, plus 5 % for damage settlement costs."
"The 
guarantees remaining vis-à-vis external parties were cancelled."
"The Group is liable for the 
accrued claims of the active and former employees of these companies in the amount of 
€4,392 million (previous year: €4,114 million)."
"RWE AG and its subsidiaries are involved in official, regulatory and antitrust proceedings, 
litigation and arbitration proceedings related to their operations and are affected by the 
results of such."
"In some cases, out-of-court claims are also filed."
"However, RWE does not 
expect any material negative repercussions from these proceedings on the RWE Group’s 
economic or financial position."
"In mid-September 2023, the Dutch government resolved to pay RWE €332 million in 
compensation for restricting coal-fired generation in the first half of 2022."
"Motivated by the war in Ukraine and the strained energy supply situation, the Dutch 
government lifted the 35 % CO2 limit in June 2022, meaning the cap on coal-fired 
generation was only effective for almost six months."
"The agreed compensation is subject to 
approval by the EU Commission under state aid law."
"(29)  Segment reporting
RWE is divided into five segments, which are separated from each other based on functional 
criteria."
"In the Offshore Wind segment, we report on our business in offshore wind, which is overseen 
by RWE Offshore Wind."
"The main production sites are located in the United Kingdom and 
Germany."
"In addition to electricity generation, activities in this field also include the 
­
development and realisation of projects to expand capacity."
The operating segment RWE Clean Energy is active on the American continent.
"The 
operating segment Onshore Wind / Solar Europe & Australia is active in Europe (mainly in the 
United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands) as well as in Australia."
"Both of these segments are responsible for business activities in onshore wind, 
photovoltaics and some aspects of battery storage in their respective regions."
"In addition to 
electricity generation, the focus of these segments is on expanding capacities."
"They have 
comparable processes in terms of the planning, development, operation and maintenance 
of wind and solar farms."
"With regard to product and customer groups, there is also cross-
segment comparability, as electricity from renewables is sold mainly in wholesale business 
to commercial customers."
"The regulatory conditions in these two segments are also 
comparable, as they are designed to provide economic incentives for the expansion of 
renewables."
"The main value drivers are identical and financial performance is influenced by 
the same factors."
"Bearing this in mind, these operating segments have comparable 
economic features and are merged together into the reporting segment Onshore 
Wind / Solar."
"Activities with run-of-river, pumped storage, biomass and gas-fired power plants are 
bundled in the Hydro / Biomass / Gas segment."
"It also contains the Dutch power stations 
Amer and Eemshaven, which use hard coal and biomass, certain battery storage units and 
the company RWE Technology International, which specialises in project management and 
engineering services."
"This segment is the responsibility of RWE Generation, which is also 
responsible for formulating and implementing RWE’s hydrogen strategy."
"The 37.9 % stake in 
the Austrian energy utility KELAG is also reported in the Hydro / Biomass / Gas segment."
"The Supply & Trading segment handles the proprietary trading of energy commodities and 
trading with pipeline gas and LNG."
"This segment is the responsibility of RWE Supply & 
Trading, which also supplies energy to some major industrial and commercial customers 
and conducts a number of other trading activities."
"It is also responsible for selling the 
majority of the electricity we produce and procuring the fuel and emission allowances we 
need to generate electricity."
"Additionally, gas storage facilities in Germany also belong to 
this segment, as well as our LNG infrastructure development activities."
"The Coal / Nuclear segment, which represents our non-core business, covers German 
­
electricity production using coal and nuclear power, as well as lignite mining operations in 
the Rhineland."
"It also includes the pro-rata activities of the Dutch power plant operator EPZ 
(30 %) and shares in the German company URANIT (50 %), which holds a 33 % stake in 
Urenco, a uranium enrichment specialist."
"The aforementioned activities and investments 
are primarily the responsibility of the group company RWE Power."
"‘Other, consolidation’ covers RWE AG, consolidation effects and the activities of other 
­
business areas which are not presented separately."
"These activities primarily include the 
non-controlling interests in the German transmission system operator Amprion and in E.ON; 
the E.ON dividend is reported in the financial result."

The adjustments made to EBIT amounted to – €1,867 million."
"In the previous year, we 
reported a significantly larger loss for this item (– €4,680 million), which was mainly due to 
the temporary earnings effects from the valuation of derivatives (– €4,195 million)."
"In the 
reporting period, these effects resulted in income of €1,386 million."
"The result reported 
under ‘other’ decreased by €2,889 million to – €3,374 million."
"Impairments on lignite-fired 
units and opencast mining (– €1.1 billion) and on our Dutch power plant assets (– €0.6 billion) 
were significant factors in this regard."
"The impairments were necessary because market 
conditions for these activities have deteriorated."
"We also increased the provisions for 
impending losses for long-term power purchase agreements."
"Unlike in last year’s 
corresponding period, we reported capital gains in the non-operating result, in the amount 
of €121 million."
"The main reason for this was the sale of RWE Gas Storage CZ, which is 
discussed on page 132."
"The adjustments to the financial result totalling €19 million hardly 
had any impact."
"The prior-year figure (€1,244 million) was substantially higher due to 
extraordinary effects: an increase in discount rates used to calculate mining and nuclear 
provisions reduced the present value of obligations, leading to a substantial earnings 
contribution."
"(30)  Notes to the cash flow statement
The cash flow statement classifies cash flows according to operating, investing and 
­
financing activities."
"Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement correspond to the 
amount stated on the balance sheet."
"Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, 
demand deposits and fixed-interest marketable securities with a maturity of three months 
or less from the date of acquisition."
"Cash flows from the acquisition and sale of consolidated subsidiaries and other business 
units are included in cash flows from investing activities, while effects stemming from 
exchange rate developments and other changes in value are shown separately."
"During the 
fiscal year, reduced by the amount of cash and cash equivalents disposed of, sales prices in 
the amount of €351 million (previous year: – €14 million) were recognised for disposals 
resulting in a change of control."
"During the fiscal year, increased by the amount of cash and 
cash equivalents acquired, purchase prices amounting to €4,575 million (previous year: 
€137 million) were recognised for acquisitions which also resulted in a change of control."
"As 
in the previous year, the purchase prices paid and sales prices received were effected 
exclusively in cash."
"In relation to this, cash and cash equivalents (disregarding assets held for 
sale) were acquired in the amount of €78 million (previous year: €1 million) and were sold in 
the amount of €30 million (previous year: €21 million)."
1	 Some prior-year figures restated (see page 208).
"The funds were used to pay a one-time lease fee for a site the New York Bight, on 
which we intend to build ­

Within the framework of their ordinary business activities, RWE AG and its subsidiaries have 
business relationships with numerous companies."
"These include associated companies and 
joint ventures, which are classified as related parties."
"In particular, this category includes 
material investments of the RWE Group, which are accounted for using the equity method."
"The item ‘other changes’ includes interest expenses which are reported in cash flows from 
operating activities."
"Restrictions on the disposal of cash and cash equivalents amounted to €2 million (previous 
year: €8 million)."
"In addition to supply and service transactions, there are also 
financial links with joint ventures."
"During the reporting period, income of €0 million (previous 
year: €1 million) was recorded from interest-bearing loans to joint ventures."
"As of the 
­
balance-sheet date, financial receivables accounted for €32 million of the receivables from 
joint ventures (previous year: €37 million)."
"All transactions were completed at arm’s length 
conditions, i."
"on principle the conditions of these transactions did not differ from those 
with other enterprises."
"€679 million of the receivables (previous year: €202 million) and 
€243 million of the liabilities (previous year: €358 million) fall due within one year."
"Other 
­
obligations from executory contracts amounted to €166 million (previous year: €111 million)."
"Above and beyond this, the RWE Group did not execute any material transactions with 
related companies or persons."
"The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of RWE AG are deemed to be 
key management personnel for the RWE Group, in respect of whom the following 
­
information on total compensation is to be reported pursuant to IAS 24."
"Share-based payment 
was ­
measured according to IFRS 2."
"Provisions totalling €22,138,000 (previous year: 
€13,441,000) were formed for obligations vis-à-vis key management personnel."
"The following information pertains to total remuneration pursuant to the guidelines of 
­
German commercial law."
"In total, the remuneration of the Executive Board amounted to €14,176,000 (previous year: 
€12,259,000)."
"This contains share-­
based payments amounting to €4,684,000 (111,961 
RWE performance shares) granted within the framework of the LTIP SPP."
"­
In the previous 
year, share-based payments amounting to €3,980,000 (115,347 RWE performance 
shares) were granted."
"Including remuneration from subsidiaries for the exercise of mandates, the Supervisory 
Board received total remuneration of €3,603,000 (previous year: €3,609,000 ) in fiscal 
2023."
"The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board have labour contracts with 
the respective Group companies."
"Remuneration occurs in accordance with the relevant 
contractual conditions."
"During the period under review, no loans or advances were granted to members of the 
­
Executive Board."
"Two employee representatives on the Supervisory Board had employee 
loans totalling €12,000."
"Former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependants received 
€13,304,000 (previous year: €14,115,000), of which €698,000 came from subsidiaries 
(previous year: €686,000)."
"As of the balance-sheet date, €115,711,000 (previous year: 
€111,506,000) were accrued for defined benefit obligations to former members of the 
Executive Board and their surviving dependants."
"Of this, €5,120,000 was set aside at 
­
subsidiaries (previous year: €5,170,000)."

"Other assurance services 
mainly include fees for reviews related to statutory or court-ordered requirements."
"264b of 
the German Commercial Code 
In fiscal 2023, the following German subsidiaries made partial use of the exemption clause 
pursuant to Sec."
"The 
renewables company Masdar, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, is our new partner in two 
offshore wind projects we are planning at Dogger Bank South in the UK North Sea, as 
contractually agreed at the end of 2023."
"The partnership entered into force at the end of 
February 2024, after all official approvals were received."
"Masdar now holds a 49 % stake in 
both of the Dogger Bank South projects and has already reimbursed us accordingly for the 
development expenses previously incurred."
"RWE retains a 51 % stake and is responsible for 
the construction and operation of the assets."
"The Dogger Bank is a large area off the 
northeast coast of England that has very shallow sea depths."
"The two planned wind farms 
could each have a capacity up to 1.5 GW."
"Our goal is to complete the two wind farms by the 
end of 2031."
"We are also building the 1.4 GW Sofia Offshore Wind project on the Dogger 
Bank, which should have all of its turbines online in 2026."
"This project is being carried out by 
RWE on its own."
RWE successful at British capacity market auctions.
"At a British capacity market auction 
in February 2024, all participating RWE power stations secured a capacity payment."
"The 
auction was held for the period from 1 October 2027 to 30 September 2028."
"RWE assets 
with 6,353 MW of generation capacity qualified this time."
"We will receive a capacity 
payment of £65 / kW (plus inflation adjustment) for making them available."
Gersteinwerk wins bid for German capacity reserve.
"Our combined-cycle natural gas 
units F, G and K 1 at the Gersteinwerk site in Werne (North Rhine-Westphalia) qualified for 
participation in the German capacity reserve for the period from 1 October 2024 to 
30 September 2026."
"The decision was reached in a tender by the Federal Network Agency 
in February 2024."
"Altogether the units will provide 820 MW of reserve capacity, which can 
be used if necessary to ensure grid stability."
"We will receive a capacity payment of €99.99 
per kilowatt and year."
"Units F and G had already successfully participated in the first two 
tenders of this kind."
"As reserve power plants, they have thus no longer been participating in 
the regular electricity market since 1 October 2020 and are only started up at the request 
of the transmission system operator."
"By contrast, this was unit K 1’s first participation in a 
capacity reserve tender."

"4.9 Independent auditor’s report
•	 the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of 
the Group’s position."
"In all material respects, this group management report is consistent 
with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and 
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development."
"Our audit 
­
opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the non-financial 
statement referred to above."
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any 
reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and 
of the group management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group 
­
management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation ­
 
(No."
"537 / 2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) in compliance with 
­
German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the 
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"We performed 
the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the 
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, 
principles and standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report” section of 
our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the 
requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have 
fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these 
­
requirements."
"In addition, we have audited the group management report 
of RWE Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the Company’s management report, for 
the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"In accordance with the German 
legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the non-financial statement to 
comply with §§ [Articles] 289b to 289e HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial 
Code] and with §§ 315b to 315c HGB."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,
•	 the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, 
with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German 
­
commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated 
financial statements and on the group management report."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most 
­
significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 
January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion 
­
thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters."
"signed an agreement on the acquisition 
by RWE of 100 % of the shares of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, Inc."
"The 
legal transfer of the shares, which is accounted for as a business combination under 
IFRS 3 using the acquisition method, took place on March 1, 2023 (acquisition date and 
date of initial consolidation)."
"Immediately after the acquisition of CEB, the acquired 
activities were merged into the company RWE Clean Energy, LLC, which is fully 
consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of RWE."
"Taking into account 
modifications, the purchase price amounted to EUR 3,819 million."
"As part of the 
purchase price allocation, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were 
measured at fair value as of the acquisition date."
"Taking into account the remeasured 
net assets acquired of EUR 2,324 million, the resulting goodwill amounted to 
EUR 1,495 million."
"As part of our audit of the presentation of the CEB acquisition, we first of all obtained an 
understanding of the underlying contractual agreements and verified the determination 
of the date of acquiring control and the purchase price."
"On that basis, we assessed the 
recognition and measurement of the assets and liabilities."
"This included their 
identification, the application of uniform accounting policies, and their fair value 
recognition as of the acquisition date."
"In this context, we assessed in particular the fair 
values that RWE determined with the assistance of an external expert."
"This involved 
assessing, among other things, the models on which the measurements were based as 
well as the measurement parameters and assumptions used."
"The assessment covered 
in particular examining the methodological and mathematical accuracy of the 
measurement models."
We also assessed the costs of capital used.
"Given the special 
features involved in calculating the fair values in the context of the purchase price 
allocation, our valuation specialists assisted in the process."
"Furthermore, we evaluated 
the technical implementation of initial consolidation and examined the calculation of 
goodwill."
"We also evaluated the disclosures in the notes to the financial statements that 
are required under IFRS 3."
"Recoverability of goodwill
In the consolidated financial statements of RWE Aktiengesellschaft, goodwill amounting 
to EUR 4.4 billion (4.2 % of consolidated total assets) is reported under the “Intangible 
assets” balance sheet item."
"Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when there are indications of impairment, 
to determine any possible need for write-downs."
"The carrying amounts of the relevant 
cash-generating units, including goodwill, are compared with the corresponding 
­
recoverable amounts in the context of the impairment tests."
"The recoverable amount is 
calculated on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use."
"The 
impairment tests are performed at the level of the cash-generating units or groups of 
cash-­
generating units to which the respective goodwill is allocated."
"­
Expectations relating to future market developments and country-specific 
assumptions about the performance of macroeconomic indicators are also taken into 
account."
"­
Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models."
"The discount 
rate applied is the weighted average cost of capital for the relevant cash-­
generating 
unit."
The impairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary.
"The outcome 
of these valuations is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the
executive directors of the future cash flows of the cash-generating units, and on the 
respective discount rates, rates of growth and other assumptions employed."
"The 
measurement is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty."
"Against this background 
and due to the underlying complexity of the measurement, this matter was of particular 
significance in the context of our audit."
"As part of our audit, we, among other things, evaluated the method used for performing 
impairment tests and assessed the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital."
"In addition, we assessed whether the future cash flows underlying the measurements 
together with the weighted average cost of capital used represent an appropriate basis 
for the impairment tests overall."
"We evaluated the appropriateness of the future cash 
flows used in the calculations, among other things by comparing this data with the 
Group’s medium-term plan and by reconciling it against general and sector-specific 
market expectations."
"In this context, we also assessed whether the costs of Group 
­
functions were properly included in the respective cash-generating unit."
"Furthermore, we 
evaluated the sensitivity ­
analyses performed by the Company in order to assess any 
impairment risk (carrying amount higher than recoverable amount) in the event of a 
reasonably possible change in a material assumption underlying the measurement."
"Overall, the measurement ­
parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors 
are in line with our ­
expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be 
reasonable."
"The Company identified indications for impairment in the “Coal / Nuclear” and 
“Hydro / Biomass / Gas” segments due to the changes in the political and economic 
environment (including increased interest rate and significant price fluctuations), and 
consequently carried out impairment tests."
"The measurement of items of property, plant 
and equipment was tested using their fair values less costs of disposal that exceed their 
values in use."
"The Company measures the fair values of the respective property, plant 
and equipment as the present value of the future cash flows using discounted cash flow 
models."
"The budget projections for the coming three years (medium-term plan) 
prepared by the executive directors and acknowledged by the supervisory board are 
used as the basis."
"These are extrapolated on the basis of long-term assumptions with 
regard to electricity, coal, natural gas and CO2 certificate prices as well as the planned 
service lives of the power plants."
"The assessment of the ­
measurement of property, plant 
and equipment identified write-downs amounting in total to EUR 1.7 billion."
"The 
outcome of these valuations is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by 
the executive directors of the future cash flows, and on the ­
discount rates and other 
assumptions employed."
"The measurements are therefore ­
subject to considerable 
uncertainties, meaning that this matter was of particular ­
significance in the context of 
our audit."
"As part of our audit, we, among other things, evaluated the method used for testing the 
measurement of property, plant and equipment and assessed the calculation of the 
weighted average cost of capital."
"In addition, we assessed whether the future cash 
inflows underlying the measurements together with the weighted cost of capital used 
represent an appropriate overall basis for testing the measurement."
"­
Furthermore, on the basis of the medium-term plan, we assessed the measurement of 
property, plant and equipment based on the evidence provided to us."
"With the 
­
knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have 
material effects on the fair values calculated in this way, we also focused our ­
assessment 
on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and evaluated the 
­
measurement model."
"Overall, the measurement parameters and assumptions used by 
the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges 
considered by us to be reasonable."

Other Information
The executive directors are responsible for the other information."
"The other information 
comprises the non-financial statement to comply with §§ 289b to 289e HGB and with 
§§ 315b to 315c HGB as an unaudited part of the group management report."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management 
report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit 
­
opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in 
this regard."
"1 HGB and 
that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the 
Group."
"In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they 
have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i."
"e., fraudulent financial 
reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the 
­
responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they 
are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting 
unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no 
­
realistic alternative but to do so."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements and this group management report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit."
"The risk of not 
­
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
­
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and 
the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"We are 
­
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit."
"We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinions."
"•	 Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial 
statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it 
­
provides."
"•	 Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive 
directors in the group management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive 
directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of 
the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate audit 
opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a 
substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective 
information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
