chains and protect liquidity."

of aggression further strengthened the new awareness of the requirements for safeguarding democratic freedom

continued in fiscal 2023, which meant that the effects of the accompanying economic challenges could be more 
than compensated for."

dialog with the CEO again."

fiscal year, these discussions focused on the consequences of the economic conditions and, to a large extent, the 
implications of the war in Ukraine."

constructive dialog again in fiscal 2023."
"The Supervisory Board was involved directly and at an early stage in all 
decisions of key importance to the Rheinmetall Group."

companies, the German Stock Corporation Act prescribes a binding quota for the representation of women of at

operational and technological priorities and targets, along with their economic significance and expected 
influences on Rheinmetall’s financial situation."

orientation and the further development of the Group structure."
"We also provided intensive advice on 
opportunities and methods to safeguard the competitiveness and future viability of the company, especially with 
a view to the impact of the Ukraine war and other current trouble spots."
"Furthermore, we dealt with potential 
acquisition projects, in particular the acquisition of the Spanish ammunition manufacturer Expal Systems S.A.U., 
as well as actual and potential risks to the company, as required."
The Supervisory Board was supported reliably and effectively by the different committees again in 2023.
"At each 
of the subsequent plenary assembly meetings, the chairs of the committees reported on their preparations for the 
relevant agenda items, their general deliberations and the decisions they had taken, and provided comprehensive 
answers to all questions asked by the Supervisory Board members."
"The proposed resolution was adopted 
unanimously with the following vote."
"The proposed resolutions 
were unanimously approved without abstentions."
Both the Executive Board and the auditor provided comprehensive answers to our questions.
"Other topics included the appropriation of net income and the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2023 and its 
implementation as a virtual format, in which shareholders essentially enjoy the same shareholder rights as at a 
physical Annual General Meeting."
All proposed resolutions were approved unanimously.

communication."

of the Regional Advisory Board West of Commerzbank AG and dealt with preparations for the virtual Annual General 
Meeting on May 9, 2023."
"On August 17, 2023, the general business position was discussed in detail."

unplanned growth investments in 2023 with implications for the investment framework plan and the 
consequences for the 2023 OFCF."
"We also approved the consequences of these 
unplanned growth investments for the OFCF."
"The OFCF target value was thus adjusted for the short-term incentive 
(STI) for fiscal 2023 due to the amended investment action plan."
"The IT incident and the consequences thereof determined 
the discussion of current IT issues."
The timetable for the integration of IT for all divisions was also discussed.

unanimously."

and the modalities of the 2024 Annual General Meeting were discussed."

The Strategy, Technology and ESG Committee met in March and November in the year under review."
"The general 
external conditions presented by the Executive Board and the associated challenges and potential disruptions 
were discussed at length."
"In particular, the current events in Ukraine and their effects were also discussed in depth."
"The possibilities for 
support from the industry for the German government were still of interest here."
"Other topics included the potential 
for Rheinmetall arising from requirements communicated by the German armed forces and whether sufficient 
production capacity was available or could be further expanded."
"In addition, the fundamental planning and 
procurement process of the German armed forces was addressed, as well as the impact on the company’s civilian 
divisions with regard to raw material imports, international supply chains and rising raw material and energy 
prices."
"In addition, the Executive Board looked at the findings of internal strategy meetings with the individual divisions."
"The strategic and business alignment of the divisions and the courses of action to be derived from this were 
presented in detail."
"The strategic highlights were also presented, as well as the resulting growth plans and 
financial targets at division level."
"In addition, an update was provided on new strategic directions in the civilian 
sector and, in particular, on the merger of the divisions that are primarily active in the civilian sector into a new 
Power Systems division."
"The aim of merging these divisions is to strengthen the civilian business, increase 
business relevance within the Rheinmetall Group and achieve synergy effects."
"In the past fiscal year, the Audit Committee met in January, March, May, August, November and December."
"Prior to their publication, the quarterly 
and semi-annual results were discussed in detail with the Executive Board."
"The auditors of the financial 
statements participated in the Audit Committee meetings in March and December 2023."
"The members also 
dealt with the self-evaluation of the Audit Committee and compliance activities in the Rheinmetall Group."
"The 
committee’s self-evaluation revealed a good overall position."
"Individual members will continue to deepen their 
expertise in the area of sustainability reporting and Rheinmetall-specific topics through qualified measures."
The key audit areas in 2023 were characterized as largely stable compared with the previous year.
"Other topics 
discussed in this context were Rheinmetall’s control system, the status of IT controls and hedge accounting and 
the new requirements for the non-financial statement."
"Furthermore, the members of the Audit Committee looked at the material organizational and oversight duties 
required of companies with respect to related party transactions under ARUG II."
"The members were also informed 
by the Executive Board about the current state of affairs regarding major projects that are in the bidding and 
performance phase."
"Furthermore, the members of the Audit Committee discussed the status of preparations for 
the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 9, 2023 and the dividend proposal."
"The Audit Committee also made a decision concerning agreements with the auditor, specifically the audit 
engagement, setting focal points of the audit and arranging fees."
"The Executive Board provided information 
regularly on the scope of non-auditing services."
"At meetings during the year, the members of the Audit Committee were also informed by managers at the company 
about the Group’s legal function, corporate social responsibility (CSR), compliance and tax compliance, risk 
management and internal auditing within the Rheinmetall Group."
"Along with the standard processes put in place, 
individual topics within these areas were also discussed."
"The members of the Audit Committee gained a more in-
depth picture of existing structures and organizations, workflows and rules and had the opportunity to ask 
questions about and comment on developments that were presented and the planned improvement measures in 
these areas."
"As a result, the Audit Committee has not become aware of any circumstances that speak against the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems as a whole."
"The Audit Committee satisfied itself that the 
company reviews the systems on an ongoing basis and systematically and consistently expands them."
"Three members of the Audit Committee have particular knowledge and experience in the application of accounting 
principles and internal control processes (financial experts)."
"Professor Susanne Hannemann, Louise Öfverström 
and Ulrich Grillo are independent and are not former members of the Executive Board of the company."
"Other topics were the text of the remuneration 
report for 2022 and the remuneration of the Supervisory Board."
"In addition, the revision of the Executive Board 
remuneration system was presented and the adjustments for 2024 were resolved."
"In this context, an adjustment 
to the weighting of EBT and OFCF as part of the STI was discussed in detail and subsequently decided upon."
"The 
reason given for the decision was that future growth potential requires investments that have not always been 
taken into account in the planning and may be unscheduled."
"These are therefore more difficult to manage within 
one year and are unsuitable for the STI."
"In the past fiscal year, the Nomination Committee met in August and December 2023 to prepare nominations for 
Supervisory Board mandates expiring at the Annual General Meeting."
"When searching for candidates, the results of the efficiency review and 
the recommendations on composition were also taken into account, including in particular the aspects of 
geopolitics and further strengthening of ESG expertise."
"Taking these requirements into account, the committee 
then made recommendations to the plenary assembly of the Supervisory Board at the meeting in December 
regarding proposals for the election of new shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board."
"These election 
proposals will be published with the invitation to the 2024 Annual General Meeting."
"In spring 2024, it is intended 
to update the skills profile of the Supervisory Board, taking these election proposals into account."
"The committee pursuant to section 27(3) of the German Codetermination Act, which is required under statutory 
law, did not convene in the past fiscal year."
"Composition of the Executive Board 
In fiscal year 2023, the Executive Board consisted of three members: Armin Papperger, as Chair of the Executive 
Board of Rheinmetall AG, and the Executive Board members Dagmar Steinert (CFO) and Peter Sebastian Krause 
(HR)."
"Corporate governance 
The further development of the fundamental principles and regulations concerning corporate governance at the 
company – in particular, the application of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code 
(GCGC) – are regularly monitored by the Supervisory Board."
"We followed the recommendations 
contained in the latest version of the code dated April 28, 2022 with one exception (exclusion of subsequent 
changes to target values or comparison parameters) in 2023."
"The complete wording of the current and previous declarations 
of conformity with the code can be viewed on the company’s website under the heading Corporate Governance – 
Declaration of Conformity."
"No indications of any actual conflicts of interest involving members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board 
within the meaning of principle 20 and Recommendations E.1 and E.2 of the GCGC were identified in the past fiscal 
year."
No former members of the Executive Board of the company are members of the Supervisory Board.
The members of the Supervisory Board take their own initiative to undertake any training that may be required.
"Where required, they are supported in their efforts by the company."
"The 
results of past efficiency reviews, which were performed either as self-assessments or with external input, were 
consistently positive."
"The workflows and processes of the Supervisory Board were classed as target-oriented and 
efficient, and any knowledge obtained is incorporated into the Supervisory Board’s work."
"After the Supervisory 
Board targets were updated and a skills profile for the entire Supervisory Board was adopted at the meeting in 
August 2020, an efficiency review was carried out in fiscal 2023."
"The skills profile for the full Supervisory Board is 
to be updated in spring 2024, taking into account the nomination proposals for two new members of the 
shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"The working methods of 
the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and the committees are also described."
"It also contains information 
on the gender quota and describes the diversity concept for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board."
"The participation quota of members in discussions on the plenary assembly and on the committees remained at 
a high level at 97%."
"Members who were unable to attend meetings were involved in decision-making through 
submission of a proxy vote."

"The auditor conducted the audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for 
the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in 
Germany) (IDW)."
"The members of the Supervisory Board received the single-entity and consolidated financial statements 
documentation, the proposed resolution on the appropriation of net income and the audit reports prepared by the 
auditors in good time in order to ensure an in-depth, thorough review."
"This financial statement documentation 
was discussed in detail during the Audit Committee’s meeting on March 12, 2024, and at the annual accounts 
meeting of the Supervisory Board on March 13, 2024, in the presence of the auditors and following the 
presentation of the auditors’ report."
"They provided information on the scope, focal points and key results of their 
audit, answered all questions without reservations and also offered additional information."
"We examined the single-entity and consolidated financial statements, the combined management report, the 
remuneration report and the proposal for the appropriation of net income for the year."
There were no objections.
We concurred with the results of the audit performed by the auditors.
"We approved the single-entity and 
consolidated financial statements presented by the Executive Board for fiscal 2023 at today’s Supervisory Board 
meeting."
"The financial statements are thus adopted under the terms of section 172 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act."
"As a result of the war in Ukraine, there were extraordinary challenges to be faced again in the year under review, 
which placed huge demands on all those involved."
"Tackling all of the associated tasks and additional difficulties 
requires motivation, flexibility, resilience, courage and tenacity."
"Also on behalf of my colleagues on the 
Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members of the Executive Board, the managers and all employees."
"In 
these tumultuous times, you again made Rheinmetall’s success possible in 2023, against all odds, with your hard 
work and your considerable personal dedication."
"To our customers, shareholders and business partners, I would 
like to thank you for the trust that you have often placed in Rheinmetall over many years, and particularly during 
these challenging times."

"The Articles of Association of the company were last amended on May 9, 2023."
"Rheinmetall AG is the parent company of the Rheinmetall Group and has its registered office in Düsseldorf, 
Germany, at the Group headquarters."
"As the management holding company, it defines the long-term strategic 
orientation and corporate policy of the Rheinmetall Group."
"It also performs control and governance functions and 
provides services to the Group companies."
"Its most important tasks include specifying targets and guidelines, 
optimizing the investment portfolio, central financing, risk management and filling management positions in the 
Group."
"Support and service functions, such as finances, HR, corporate communications, law, taxation, internal 
auditing, compliance, corporate social responsibility and mergers & acquisitions, are performed at Group level."
"Rheinmetall AG ensures that there is a Group-wide, standardized planning, control and management process in 
place, and within the context of the compliance management system it monitors the Group-wide implementation 
of laws, guidelines and regulations in accordance with a set of uniform criteria."
"With effect from 1 October 2023, the Vehicle Systems Division was reorganised at management level."
"It was 
divided into the Vehicle Systems Europe and Vehicle Systems International divisions."
"Vehicle Systems Europe 
primarily focuses on the European market, not including Great Britain, while Vehicles Systems International 
concentrates on the markets of Australia, the US, and Great Britain."
"This will allow the group to better address the 
specific challenges and opportunities of the respective markets."
"Both divisions already have their own 
management team and are directly managed by the Executive Board."
"»Corporate management and control In 
external reporting, the two divisions are presented as one segment, Vehicle Systems."
"This had a particular impact on Weapon and 
Ammunition and Electronic Solutions."
The small-bore business area is managed as a non-core business outside the structure of the group.
"In December 
2023, Rheinmetall and Comitans Capital AG signed a sale and purchase agreement for the entire small-bore 
business area."
"They are aiming to close the transaction, which is still subject to approval by the relevant 
authorities, as of March 31, 2024."
"The transfer of technology between the individual parts of the Group and a focus on future-driven technologies 
and business areas with large potential for sustained growth and value enhancement are the cornerstones of the 
structure."
"The activities are consistently aligned towards the economic regions of 
Europe, America, Asia and Australia."
"In the year under review, Rheinmetall was represented at 174 locations 
worldwide."
"Information on the sales distribution by region can be found under »Sales by region, while the 
distribution of employees is described under »Employees."
"Rheinmetall AG has direct or indirect holdings in 218 companies in Germany and abroad (previous year: 206) that 
are part of the Rheinmetall Group."
The scope of consolidation includes 175 subsidiaries (previous year: 166).
"In 
financial 2023, a total of nine companies were added to the fully consolidated subsidiaries through formation and 
three companies through acquisition."
"The disposals of the fully consolidated subsidiaries from the scope of 
consolidation are attributable to three sales."
"was added to the Group as a fully consolidated 
subsidiary."
"With the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U., Rheinmetall is opening up further production capacities 
in the field of large and medium calibre ammunition and expanding its product portfolio."
"Thanks to the 
technologies available at Expal and the order backlog, the acquisition also helps to secure Rheinmetall's core 
business in the field of weapons, ammunition and propulsion systems in the long term."
"In the Pistons division, 
which is managed as a non-core business, the large-bore pistons business was sold and several blocks of shares 
held in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
"A total of 35 companies are carried at equity, as compared to 35 
companies in the previous year."
The Group is also involved in 8 joint operations (previous year: 5).
"Business activities and markets  
Rheinmetall is an international group in various markets with technologically leading products and services."
"The 
sales focus is on the security technology and mobility segments."
"With its product portfolio, Rheinmetall fulfills 
these basic key needs of modern society."
"Divisions 
Vehicle Systems Europe, Vehicle Systems International, Weapon and Ammunition, and Electronic Solutions are 
among the defence and security industry’s leading suppliers of innovative products for the German and 
international armed and security forces."
"They provide system and subsystem solutions as well as a broad portfolio 
of services for capabilities in the areas of mobility, reconnaissance, command and control, C4I and protection."
"They also develop customized training and simulation solutions and provide services in the field of mission 
logistics."
Rheinmetall also serves the requirements of the navy and air force and for internal security.
"Whether 
for requirements specific to different branches of the armed forces or overall requirements, whether for external 
or internal security, there is a wide product portfolio of platforms and components, which are offered as individual 
and connected system solutions."
"This makes Rheinmetall an important partner in this field to the German armed 
forces, their allies and friendly armies, along with civil national security forces."
"All development, production and service activities are geared towards ensuring the best possible protection for 
soldiers."
"The activities continuously set new technological standards: from vehicle, protection and weapon 
systems, through infantry equipment and air defence, to the networking of function sequences, as well as in the 
fields of digitalization, automation, electro-optics and simulation."
"Tactics and logistics  Vehicle Systems Europe offers a diverse portfolio of operationally proven wheeled and 
tracked vehicles, including combat, support, logistics and special vehicles, that is continuously developed further."
Vehicle Systems Europe consists of the Tactical Vehicles and Logistic Vehicles business units.
"Sensors, guidance 
systems, protection technologies and effectors from partner divisions make Rheinmetall’s wheeled and tracked 
vehicles the highly effective systems that they are."
"Vehicle Systems International has a comparable portfolio but focuses on the markets of Australia, the US and 
Great Britain in order to provide global customers with more individual support."
"Impact and cover  The portfolio of Weapon and Ammunition comprises solutions for threat-appropriate, effective 
and accurate firepower as well as comprehensive protection."
"Whether on land, on water, or in the air, Rheinmetall 
as one of the leading technology companies delivers systems for superiority on current and future battlefields and 
deployment areas."
"Weapon and Ammunition consists of three business units: Weapon and Munition, Propulsion 
Systems, and Protection Systems."
"Digitalization, networking and cyber – Electronic Solutions encompasses the entire chain of effects in the system 
network – from sensors and the networking of platforms and soldiers to the (partially) automated connection of 
effectors."
This is supplemented by solutions for protection in cyberspace.
"Other fields of action include extensive 
training and simulation solutions, in which the company has more than 40 years of experience."
"It also offers 
operator solutions for aircraft."
"Electronic Solutions consists of the Air Defence & Radar Systems, Integrated 
Electronic Systems, and Technical Publications business units."
"The civilian activities of Sensors and Actuators and of Materials and Trade comprise development services, 
manufacturing and replacement parts supply in the mobility sector."
"The core areas of expertise lie in the reduction 
of emissions, pollutants and fuel consumption, as well as cooling and thermal management and reduction of 
weight and friction in relation to internal combustion engines."
"This applies to not only passenger cars, but also 
light- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles."
"In addition, there are an increasing number of alternative drive system products in hybrid, electric and fuel cell 
vehicles."
"This includes electric drive units comprising a motor and power electronics as well as complete and 
efficient thermal management modules."
"Another focus area is applications of the product and service range in 
non-automotive market segments, such as the hydrogen economy, renewable energies or the house-warming 
segment."
"Gas, thermal and fluid management applications – Sensors and Actuators stands for expertise in gas, thermal 
and fluid management applications in the mobility and industrial sectors."
"The five business units – Actuators, 
Automotive Emission Systems, Commercial Diesel Systems, Pump Technology, and Solenoid Valves – develop 
solutions for the major challenges in mobility, such as downsizing, reducing emissions, and increasing efficiency 
while also optimizing performance."
"With the Trade 
business unit, it also represents Rheinmetall’s global aftermarket activities."
"The development focus in the Small 
Bore Pistons, Bearings, and Castings business units is on the major challenges for the sector, such as reducing 
weight, reducing emissions, and increasing service life while also optimizing performance."
"The extensive product 
portfolio comprises pistons for gasoline and diesel engines in passenger and commercial vehicles, pistons for 2-
stroke engines and compressors, polymer-coated and metal plain bearings, castings (e.g."
"structural components) 
and continuous casting products."
The various fields of activity can be seen in the following overview.
"Rheinmetall’s range of products and capabilities is tailored to central defence technology requirements that firstly 
result nationally and internationally from many armed forces’ substantial ongoing need for technical 
modernization and replacements."
"The market potential for Vehicle Systems Europe, Vehicle Systems International, Weapon and Ammunition, and 
Electronic Solutions is essentially derived from the defence budgets of customer countries."
"Rheinmetall is still in 
an international growth market in the medium term, even though national defence budgets fluctuate to varying 
degrees, depending on the security situation and political circumstances."
"»General economic conditions In light 
of the wars, it can be assumed that the general trend toward increased spending will solidify and continue to 
accelerate in European countries in particular."
"This trend is also the result 
of calls to increase governments’ resilience to internal and external threats, ability to take military action and the 
need to guarantee stable and secure supplies in periods of peace and war."
"International defence markets find themselves in a long-term cycle that is characterized by comparatively high 
budgets and new procurement."
"According to the target set at the NATO summit in Wales in 2014, each NATO member state should be spending up 
to 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence by 2024."
"NATO has since agreed to tighten the requirements 
for defence spending and make this target a minimum level."
"Of this spending, 20% is to be invested in new 
defence and research projects."
"This second target will create additional order opportunities for Rheinmetall, 
particularly with respect to procurement projects in the European and German markets."
"Focus on defence of nations and alliances 
The existing investment backlog in the German armed forces is to be cleared, while also providing them with 
significantly better equipment overall and establishing a stronger focus on the defence of nations and alliances."
"The German armed forces, guided by their capability profile, must be able to meet their sworn international 
commitments as a reliable partner."
"This trend is also being driven by Germany’s role as a Framework Nation 
Concept for the military capabilities and structures of smaller allies, which requires the German armed forces to 
have a broad mix of military capacities."
"This is in addition to the German armed forces’ responsibility as the lead 
nation in NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force for protection of the eastern border within the alliance."
"The 
two combined, and the German armed forces’ role as a troop supplier for international crisis management, will 
lead to significantly increased demand over the next few years for new and additional equipment for land forces 
in particular."
"Strategically important markets in Eastern Europe, Great Britain and Australia  
In the export business in the area of security and defence technology, the markets in Great Britain, Australia, the 
US, Hungary and various Eastern European NATO member states remain of particular strategic importance."
"Following a home market strategy approach, Rheinmetall aims to create local value added and establish itself as 
a preferred partner for national armed forces, particularly in Great Britain, Spain, Australia and Hungary."
"In Eastern Europe, a number of NATO states will over the coming years be modernizing their still largely Russian-
made equipment and gradually adapting to the standards required in the western defence alliance."
"As a result of 
the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, these efforts are likely to be increased and sped up 
considerably."
"This will offer new opportunities for Rheinmetall to establish itself over the coming years as a long-
term partner, especially for equipping armies."
"Particularly in Hungary, one of Rheinmetall’s home markets, a 
decisive step was taken in this context in 2020 with the order for the new Lynx infantry fighting vehicle."
"Integration 
of the Lynx will take place in a local joint venture led by Rheinmetall and is linked to the leveraging of local value 
added."
"In addition, Rheinmetall will supply Hungary with radar systems from its Canadian subsidiary as well as 
munitions."
Corresponding production sites and facilities for this are currently being built in Hungary.
"Rheinmetall 
has also been commissioned by the Hungarian government to develop the Panther KF51 battle tank to the stage 
of readiness for series production."
"This work will include the construction and qualification of a demonstration 
product to prepare for series production."
"The tank factory opened in Zalaegerszeg will play an important role in 
this development work."
"In Kyiv, a joint venture with the Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI) was established in the 
past fiscal year."
"The first step will involve providing maintenance and other services for Ukraine, before starting 
the production and development of military vehicles there."
"Rheinmetall has also succeeded in establishing long-term close customer relations in Australia, another of its 
home markets, after acquiring major orders for military trucks, wheeled armored vehicles and munitions."
"In 2020, 
Rheinmetall’s Military Vehicle Center of Excellence in the state of Queensland became operational."
"It includes not 
only development capacity but also production and maintenance capacity."
"In the medium to long term, export 
orders can also be handled here."
"Rheinmetall has thus established itself as an equipment 
partner to the British armed forces."
"At the same time, the joint venture represents another step toward 
consolidation of the European land systems industry."
"»Strategy 
Markets for civilian products and mobility applications 
The business performance of the product range in the civilian sector and particularly in the area of mobility is 
largely determined by the production trends of international customers in the automotive industry."
"»General 
economic conditions This applies not only to existing customer contracts, but also to future projects relating to 
customers’ technological requirements."
"The technologies of tomorrow are largely determined by the ongoing 
strong trends toward the more efficient use of fuels, the reduction of emissions and alternative drive technologies."
"»General economic expectations 
Sensors and Actuators holds a Tier 1 position in the value-added chain of automotive production because it 
generally supplies automotive manufacturers directly rather than via other suppliers/system integrators."
"This also 
applies to large parts of the Materials and Trade product range."
"Despite a relatively small number of international 
automotive manufacturers, the customer portfolios are highly diversified in both cases; this also applies at 
regional level."
"Production sites in the key economic areas of Western Europe, USMCA and Asia make it possible 
to meet customer requirements for local or international production."
"The customer portfolio is increasingly being 
expanded to include industrial customers."
"The global replacement parts business serves, among others, the automotive manufacturers directly – in this case, 
the manufacturers’ service units."
"The core business, however, involves supplying a strongly diversified customer 
base in the segment covering independent service providers."
"A number of different sales channels such as 
websites, apps, call centers and online catalogs are used for this."
"In addition to its own products under the 
Pierburg and Kolbenschmidt brands, Sensors and Actuator sell products from third-party providers with a view to 
acting as a one-stop shop for customers and, in turn, strengthening customer loyalty and the cross-selling of its 
own products."
"This will also be accompanied by increasing digitalization and a gradual transition to partially 
and fully autonomous driving."
"The discussion about the global future of combustion and in particular diesel technology in the passenger car 
segment is not yet completely over."
"In recent years, it has been overshadowed to some extent by the pandemic-
related production cutbacks and the subsequent crises regarding the supply of semiconductors and raw materials, 
which led to a decline in global automotive production."
"However, electrified vehicles have noticeably gained 
market shares worldwide as the automotive industry has gradually recovered."
"The shift away from the combustion 
engine as a drive system toward partly or fully electric drives has accelerated considerably, and this trend is 
expected to continue in the coming years."
"A large number of major automotive manufacturers have launched 
further offensives in electric vehicle models and in some cases have scheduled a complete phase-out of 
combustion technology."
"According to a resolution passed by the EU Parliament on February 14, 2023, only vehicles 
that no longer emit CO2 will be registered in the European Union from 2035."
"Rheinmetall has strategically prepared 
for these developments – developments that will lead to a significant structural decline in the number of 
conventional combustion engines."
"»Strategy 
The product portfolio has successively been tailored to the strict emission regulations and the product range has 
been expanded in terms of hybrid technology, all-electric drive systems and fuel cell technology for heavy 
commercial vehicles."
Projects totaling more than €1.9 billion were acquired.
"At the same time, the transformation toward projects in the areas of electrification and fuel cells is underway."
"This 
development marks an important step toward a more sustainable and more efficient future."
"Rheinmetall is meeting 
these challenges with a diversification strategy that has already been largely secured."
"As a result, projects with a 
volume of around €750 million were gained in the areas of fuel cell systems and hydrogen technology in 2023."
"Rheinmetall’s overarching strategic objective is to concentrate technological development on high-growth 
products and future markets and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"»Strategy 
Rheinmetall wants to direct its expertise in areas such as thermal management, media control and hydrogen 
technology towards non-automotive applications and leverage sales potential in new markets."
"As hydrogen is 
considered a key element in the transition to a climate-neutral energy supply of the future, there is a focus on both 
mobile and stationary hydrogen technology applications."
"The spectrum extends from power generation derived 
from renewable energies across hydrogen production to its storage and distribution right up to its use."
"In addition, 
we will apply our breadth of expertise in the areas of sensor technology and artificial intelligence that Rheinmetall 
has gained from military applications to new mobility concepts with semi-autonomous control units."
"Regulatory environment 
Legal regulations on exports of military equipment – The Federal Republic of Germany has one of the strictest 
export control systems in the world."
"The “Political Principles 
Adopted by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for the Export of War Weapons and Other Military 
Equipment” of June 26, 2019, provide the licensing authorities with guidelines."
"European and German exports of military equipment are being restricted by numerous bans, licensing and 
reporting requirements at EU and national level."
"These restrictions allow the authorities to check critical exports 
and other foreign trade dealings with respect to arms control objectives."
"EU law takes precedence over national 
law, including German law."
"Nonetheless, according to Article 346 TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
Union), all member states can take measures they consider necessary for the protection of their essential national 
security interests."
"Decisions on the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war materials are therefore up 
to the respective national lawmakers."
"War weapons – Article 26(2) of German Basic Law states that the manufacture, transportation and marketing of 
war weapons requires a license from the German government."
"The details are specified in a federal law, the 
German War Weapons Control Act (KrWaffKontrG)."
"An annex to the KrWaffKontrG, the War Weapons List, lists all 
items that are definitively regarded as war weapons."
"War weapons include not only devices such as battle tanks, 
armored combat support vehicles and machine guns, but also certain types of ammunition such as tank or artillery 
ammunition."
"As well as complete devices and ammunition systems, certain assemblies and components such as 
the turret and chassis of a battle tank or the projectile, warhead or fuse for certain types of ammunition are 
additionally defined as war weapons."
The KrWaffKontrG includes an extensive licensing system for war weapons.
"Almost every activity relating to these 
goods requires a license."
"A license is required for the production of war weapons, both during development and 
in series production."
"Transfer of the actual control over war weapons also requires a license, as does the 
purchasing of these weapons."
The transportation of war weapons within a country is also subject to licensing.
"Moreover, the transportation of war weapons using German ships or aircraft outside German territory requires a 
license."
"Trading and brokerage transactions involving war weapons that are not intended to affect German territory 
are also subject to licensing."
"Above all, the importing, exporting and transit of war weapons requires a license."
"Exporting a war weapon requires not only the applicable licenses in accordance with the KrWaffKontrG, but also 
an additional license for export purposes, specifically an export license in accordance with the Foreign Trade and 
Payments Act (AWG) or the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation (AWV)."
"In particular, the export of these 
goods requires a license."
"The term “goods” and therefore the export controls apply not just to goods, but to 
technology and software as well."
Licenses are also needed for some types of technical support (i.e.
"the transfer of 
intangible knowledge and capabilities) and for some trading and brokerage transactions."
"It is generally possible 
to import other types of military equipment without a license."
"Regulations on trade of military equipment at EU level – The adoption of the “Council Common Position 
2008/944/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment” of 
December 8, 2008, created a legally binding regime for all EU member states."
"The Council Common Position of 
December 8, 2008, sets out a total of eight criteria for assessing export license applications."
"It gives mention to 
an EU Common Military List, which largely matches the corresponding lists of controlled military equipment of the 
EU member states."
"Controlled goods that come under these lists are largely defined and amended by the 
international export control regime."
"The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA), in particular, governs the export controls 
of conventional military equipment and dual-use goods and related technology."
"The Australia Group (AG) is active 
in the area of chemical and biological agents and dual-use goods and technologies."
"Furthermore, the aim of 
preventing proliferation is pursued by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in the area of ballistic 
missiles and by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in the area of nuclear weapons."
"The goods in the respective 
item lists in the Annex to the EU Dual-Use Regulation and German export lists are reflected in German law."
"International regulations on trade of military equipment – There has been a set of internationally applicable 
standards for the trade of conventional military equipment since the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) came into force in 
December 2014."
"On April 2, 2013, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution, by a large majority, 
to adopt the text of the Arms Trade Treaty."
"The treaty came into force on December 24, 2014."
"A total of 141 countries 
have signed the treaty to date, including Germany."
"The criteria laid down in 
the “Common Position” and any subsequent regulations form an integral part of these political principles."
"The 
principles on the export of military equipment from June 26, 2019, expressly prohibit the export of small arms and 
light weapons to third countries."
"Licenses for these weapons and the associated ammunition are now issued by 
the federal government only in exceptional cases."
"If the political principles set out more restrictive measures than 
the “Common Position,” they take precedence."
"Licenses for the export of war weapons and other military equipment are granted only on the basis of reliable prior 
knowledge of end use by the intended end-user."
"This generally requires appropriate written assurance by the end-
user in the official end-user certificate."
"This applies mutatis mutandis to any other military equipment related to war weapons 
exported in connection with a manufacturing license."
"Effective end use regulations must be made a pre-condition 
for these manufactured war weapons."
"War weapons and other military equipment related to war weapons may be reexported to third countries or brought 
into the EU single market only if the federal government has consented to this in writing."
"The same applies if post-shipment 
controls identify violations of the end-user certificate or a country refuses to conduct on-site controls despite 
making a commitment to this effect in its end-user certificate."
"Other goods – Other goods besides war weapons and other military equipment are controlled, namely dual-use 
goods (i.e."
goods that can be used for civilian and military purposes).
"In other words, they are not purely civilian 
goods."
Purely civilian goods are not generally subject to any export restrictions.
"With a few exceptions, they can 
be exported without requiring a license."
"Export of dual-use goods – The export of dual-use goods has been harmonized at European Union level since 
1995."
"The European Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) 2021/821 of May 20, 2021, “setting up a regime for 
the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit, and transfer of dual-use items” (EU Dual-Use 
Regulation) applies here."
"A common list of items lists all dual-use items that are subject to uniform control 
regulations in all EU countries."
These are based on the aforementioned international export control regime.
"The 
transfer of these goods within the EU is free, apart from a few exceptions."
"In addition to the EU Dual-Use 
Regulation, there are further listed dual-use goods in Part I Section B of the Export List to the Foreign Trade and 
Payments Regulation (AWV) that also require a license to be exported."
These are nationally listed dual-use goods.
"These are referred to as “catch-all clauses.” Factors that play a role in licensing approval 
include the intended purpose of the goods and the respective purchasing country or country of destination."
"Vehicle emissions – Mobility in its current dominant form relies on burning fossil fuels, which is inextricably linked 
to the emission of substances that are harmful to health and the environment."
"In metropolitan areas in particular, 
traffic is repeatedly leading to severe impairment of air quality."
"To reduce the negative impact on citizens’ health 
from traffic-related exhaust gases and cut greenhouse gas emissions, legislators in many countries are issuing 
limits for passenger cars and for light- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles."
"The focus here is on both CO2 
emissions that are harmful to the climate and on emissions of nitrous gases (NOX), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon 
monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) that are caused by road traffic and are harmful to health."
"Starting from the reference year 2021, CO2 emissions in the EU are to be reduced by 15% for passenger cars and 
light-duty commercial vehicles by 2025 and by 55% for passenger cars and 50% for light-duty commercial vehicles 
by 2030."
"From 2035 onward, only emission-free new cars can be registered, although there is to be an exception 
for vehicles powered by e-fuels."
"A potential adjustment of the limits is planned for 2026 to ensure new 
technological developments and a socially just transition to zero emissions."
"The European Commission is currently discussing the possibility of raising the targets to 45% / 
65% / 90% from 2030 / 2035 / 2040."
"In addition, all city buses are to be emission-free by 2035 and an 85% 
emissions reduction is to be achieved as soon as 2030."
"Development of CO2 limits in the EU 
 
In international terms, a few major countries are pursuing similarly strict limits to the EU on CO2 emissions from 
passenger cars."
"They include the US with 100 g CO2/km from 2026, and China, with a limit of 94 g CO2/km from 
2026."
"In addition to the targets mentioned above for reducing CO2 emissions, there are additional regulatory measures 
and subsidies in almost all relevant markets to stimulate demand for vehicles with electric drives."
"Programs to 
ramp up the charging infrastructure are also being implemented to support the market activation of electric 
vehicles."
"For example, the Charging Infrastructure Master Plan II was adopted in Germany in October 2022."
"Hydrogen industry – Hydrogen has a central role to play in the further development and completion of the energy 
turnaround in Germany."
"Germany’s National Hydrogen Strategy was published on June 10, 2021."
"With the National 
Hydrogen Strategy, the German government is creating a coherent framework for action for the future production, 
transport and use of hydrogen and thus for corresponding innovations and investments."
"It defines the steps that 
appear necessary to achieve climate targets, create new value chains for the German economy and further develop 
international energy policy cooperation."
"To this end, funding of over €10 billion has been made available at 
national level to accelerate the market ramp-up of the hydrogen industry in Germany."
"Germany’s National 
Hydrogen Strategy was updated in November 2022."
"The Ukraine war and its effects on the European energy market 
have made the disadvantages of excessive dependence on energy imports from individual or a few countries clear."
"Germany’s declared goal is to become an international lead market for hydrogen technologies by 2030, as 
envisaged in the coalition agreement."
"German suppliers are to offer large parts of the hydrogen production value 
chain, particularly electrolyzers."
"In another update in July 2023, the level of ambition was increased and details of 
the implementation were specified."
"The national expansion target for electrolysis capacity was thus raised from 
5 GW to at least 10 GW."
"The four fields of action of the German National Hydrogen Strategy update are to ensure 
the availability of sufficient (green) hydrogen, to expand the transport and storage infrastructure, to establish 
hydrogen applications and to create good framework conditions."
"Vehicle safety – In recent decades, developments in vehicle safety have significantly contributed to an overall 
decrease in the number of people killed and seriously injured in road accidents."
"However, around 20,000 people 
die on the roads in the European Union every year."
"Regulation 2019/2144 of the European Parliament defined a set of vehicle requirements to 
further improve the safety characteristics of vehicles as part of an integrated approach to road safety and to better 
protect vulnerable road users."
"In particular, this regulation provides for advanced driver assistance systems for all classes of motor vehicles."
"For 
example, from July 2024, only vehicles that have installed a warning system in the event of driver fatigue or 
declining driver attention and a system for monitoring driver availability can be registered."
"From July 2026, only 
vehicles that have installed an advanced warning system for declining driver concentration can be registered."
"Autonomous driving – According to the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMVI), Germany is to 
take a leading role in the field of autonomous driving."
"To make the most of the great potential of autonomous and 
connected driving, the German government wants to drive forward research and development to make the mobility 
of the future more versatile, safer, and more environmentally friendly and user-oriented."
"On July 28, 2021, the Autonomous Driving Act came into force in Germany."
"This new law creates the legal 
framework for autonomous vehicles (level 4) to be able to drive in regular operation in defined areas on public 
roads."
"According to the BMVI, this will make Germany the first country in the world to bring driverless vehicles out 
of research and into everyday use."
"It is responsible for the Group’s strategic orientation and development and for setting and 
monitoring corporate targets."
"The divisions, each with their own management and responsibility for their global 
business operations, are directly managed by the Executive Board."
"Moreover, the Executive Board is responsible 
for the introduction and further development of adequate management, control and monitoring processes, 
including the risk management system, internal control system, internal auditing and compliance management 
system and the allocation of resources."
"The respective management bodies of the subsidiaries 
are responsible for operational management of their units."
"They are supported in their tasks by the service and 
support functions that have been set up within the management holding company."
"The Supervisory Board, which consists of 16 members and is based on joint representation in accordance with the 
provisions of the 1976 German Codetermination Act, appoints, advises and monitors the Executive Board."
"The 
Executive and Supervisory Boards work together closely, constructively and in an atmosphere of trust in order to 
ensure the continued existence of the company and create sustainable value added."
"Rules of procedure are in 
place for both boards, containing regulations on the composition, tasks, responsibilities and areas subject to 
approval."
"»Supervisory Board report For further information on »Corporate Governance, please refer to the section 
of the same name."
"In line with our values and our Code 
of Conduct, we are committed to conduct characterized by responsibility, integrity, respect and fairness."
Compliance is an integral part of the corporate culture at Rheinmetall.
Our binding compliance policy serves to safeguard our business success on a lasting basis.
"We do not tolerate any damage to our company’s 
standing and to the reputation of our employees or agents as a result of unlawful and/or unethical behavior or 
corrupt business practices."
"With deliveries made to many countries around the globe, reliable guidance in a 
national and international environment is essential."
"The Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Chairman of the Executive Board, is responsible for 
Compliance and Data Privacy at holding company level."
"Compliance is divided into the areas of Compliance 
Program with the functional areas Prevention, Regulation, and Business Partners; Central Investigations with the 
functions Investigation Office and Allegation Management; and Social Compliance with the function Supply Chain 
Risk."
"As an independent organizational unit, Data Protection is divided into two functional areas."
"The focus in the 
Group Data Protection organization is on consulting, process design, project management and case handling in 
all data privacy matters."
"The internal Rheinmetall Group Data Protection Officer is responsible for monitoring 
compliance with statutory data protection requirements throughout the Group."
"In this function, he or she reports 
to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Rheinmetall AG."
"The Chief Compliance Officer is also responsible for the compliance field organization, comprising the divisional 
compliance teams, the Regional Compliance Officers abroad and the central holding support, as part of the 
strongly normative management."
"The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee on a 
regular basis, by attending meetings, on the status and effectiveness of the compliance management system and 
on the latest developments."
"In serious cases, the committees are informed immediately."
"In addition, the heads of 
the divisions are also kept apprised monthly by the Division Compliance Officers of current developments, new 
rules, planned training measures and possible compliance infringements as well as the status of possible 
investigations."
"Compliance is taken into account as an aspect of risk in decision-making processes, not only when it comes to 
considerations regarding the strategic and operational alignment of the Rheinmetall Group, but also in day-to-day 
business."
"It also creates an organizational structure that allows the applicable standards to be publicized across 
the divisions and their implementation status to be tracked."
"If binding legal regulations in individual countries 
deviate from the rules set out in the compliance management system, the stricter regulation shall apply where 
permissible."
"In the case of changes to the content, the Chief Compliance Officer’s approval is also required."
"The compliance management system is updated at regular intervals, not only in line with the applicable legal 
requirements but also in the light of new findings from reporting, comparisons with other compliance systems and 
the assessment of external specialists (benchmarking)."
"It is also reviewed on an ad-hoc basis if any breach of 
compliance regulations is suspected or discovered."
"Implementation of the compliance management system is 
monitored by regular reports to Corporate Compliance and by routine and special audits conducted by internal 
auditing and the compliance organization."
"Compliance officers also monitor important transactions in the companies, such as mergers and acquisitions, the 
establishment of joint ventures, pre-employment checks, and the integration of sales brokers, thereby supporting 
the respective departments in their work."
"In addition, compliance officers advise the people responsible in the 
operational units on how to take compliance into account in operational business processes."
"In the area of sales support, there is a platform containing compliance-relevant information on around 160 
countries and regions."
"Moreover, the tender process in the security and defence technology area is structured to 
the effect that in the course of the bid/no bid decision a compliance audit using defined criteria is obligatory for 
projects over a certain value threshold."
"Various IT tools are also used across the group to support compliance 
processes."
"Procedures for taking an 
initial inventory of compliance risks, identifying response measures and planning regular repeat measures are 
defined for different applications."
"To help continuously identify compliance risks and to develop and improve mitigation measures, the Prevention 
team was established, which focuses on structural prevention topics on an ongoing or project basis."
"The roll-out of the regulatory compliance project 
launched in 2020, which is intended to expand the “litigation-proof organization,” was driven forward in the fiscal 
year."
"Next, an IT tool will be introduced to enable the employees concerned in over 30 countries – those who have 
increased contact with regulatory areas subject to liability in their everyday and project business – to deal with 
the complex regulations more easily and reliably."
"More than 110 employees entrusted with a 
compliance function in around 130 units of the company make use of the many opportunities to track, assess and 
manage the status of a large number of compliance-relevant processes and projects at various organizational 
levels of the Rheinmetall Group."
"These include reporting on the status quo of training courses, audits, risk 
analyses, consulting focal points, processes, compliance levels for guideline roll-outs, and the recording of project 
statuses."
"The associated evaluation options will now enable compliance reporting to the Executive Board and 
Supervisory Board to focus on identified compliance risk areas and the mitigation measures established, as well 
as the related KPIs."
"Corporate Compliance | Compliance Program | Regulation – Taking account of or on the basis of external 
conditions such as laws, regulations, etc."
"and internal organizational requirements, the Executive Board of 
Rheinmetall AG issues regulations for the Rheinmetall Group so that all employees concerned act in line with 
standardized processes."
"Regulation Management, which is based in the central Corporate Compliance 
department, provides support with the preparation and management of conduct- and process-related regulations 
of Rheinmetall AG for the Rheinmetall Group."
"To ensure a standardized procedure, the Regulation Management 
Manual is available."
"This manual is aimed primarily at publishers and authors as well as members of the Executive 
Board and management bodies, but also includes several interfaces at all organizational levels."
"In the Central Regulations Register on the Group’s intranet, all regulations approved by the Executive Board can 
be called up at any time."
These are provided in German and English in line with the corporate languages.
"Using a 
continuously updated summary, all employees can obtain a quick overview of the professionally regulated topics."
"procurement, 
cooperation and sales partners) on a Group-wide basis."
"The focus lies here on determining whether the 
commitment is legally permissible, whether all attributable people can be identified (“know your customer – KYC” 
and “know your supplier – KYS”) and whether conflicts of interest are excluded."
"The general performance and 
integrity of the business partner are also assessed."
"The local compliance organization will continue concentrating 
on assessing the transaction-specific compliance risk associated with the commitment of a business partner at 
company level."
"The center of expertise will be integrated into day-to-day operational business through various 
technical and procedural interfaces."
"There is already a relatively high degree of digitalization in the Compliance 
Due Diligence organization."
"In addition to a specific management database for selecting, managing and 
monitoring cooperation and sales partners, the whole integrity due diligence process can now be performed via a 
secure online platform as well."
"As part of special projects, large quantities of data from business partners were 
migrated to the electronic third-party management system again in the year under review."
"In the past fiscal year, apart from the business partners screened by the automated procedure, around 720 
business partners and people who applied for key positions at the Rheinmetall Group were subjected to non-
automated screening in procedures of varying complexity depending on the risk."
"An additional 4,430 existing 
partners were automatically transferred to monitoring and processed by way of bulk uploads."
"Incident management is also supported by the electronic whistleblower platform “Integrity Line,” which has been 
implemented throughout the Group."
"In addition, employees can contact the compliance organization directly if 
they suspect or know of breaches of regulations or business practices."
"In addition to employees, external parties 
can also contact the ombudsperson by telephone or e-mail, send an e-mail to speakup@rheinmetall.com or 
contact a specialist compliance officer by telephone."
"Employees involved in investigations into possible breaches of compliance will be assumed to be 
innocent until proven otherwise."
Any information that is received will be systematically analyzed.
"An incident management guideline on how to deal with suspected cases and on the standardized processing of 
compliance cases aims to ensure that the handling of information is also independent, transparent and fair as 
well as being subject to high standards that are comparable across the Group."
"It also offers legal certainty when 
carrying out investigations, meaning that appropriate account can be taken of the interests of employees and the 
employer."
"Systematic follow-up checks are performed on the basis of this misconduct response policy and appropriate 
measures are taken to properly clarify the facts that have been reported, if necessary with the involvement of 
external specialists."
Confidentiality and discretion take top priority here.
"If necessary, we will involve the relevant 
authorities and cooperate with them to resolve the matter."
"Proven misconduct is sanctioned and entails 
organizational measures and, for the employees who committed the offense(s), consequences under labor law, 
civil law and criminal law."
"The Incident Response Committees established to conduct rapid, interdisciplinary initial 
evaluations of reports help to ensure that suspected cases can be identified and clarified without delay."
"The new requirements for compliance management systems introduced by the legislator, in particular the German 
Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) and the German Whistleblower Protection Act (HinschG), are currently being 
reflected in an amendment to the misconduct response policy."
"Of a total of 163 tips received in the reporting year, 126 (77%) were identified as compliance-relevant."
"A more 
detailed investigation into these matters was initiated."
"Work on these 126 investigations has led to confirmation 
of a breach of the rules in 51 cases (40%)."
"Corporate Compliance | Acquisitions & Programs – This functional area performs compliance analyses and 
compliance risk assessments for mergers and acquisitions transactions and major strategic or commercial 
projects."
"It is coordinated by the Head of Corporate Compliance and staffed on a project basis by compliance staff 
working centrally and/or locally."
"Group data protection 
The Executive Board is responsible for setting up a Group-wide data protection management system (DPMS)."
"Within the compliance organization, the structures required for the Group-wide implementation of legal data 
protection requirements were established and an effective DPMS was introduced."
"The Group Data Privacy Officer 
manages the data privacy officers at the company divisions, liaises with them to manage the implementation of 
the DPMS and further develops the DPMS where required."
"He reports regularly to the Chief Compliance Officer and, 
where required, to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board directly."
"Data protection management relates to the organizational setup and processes required to safeguard the 
implementation of legal requirements involved in the planning, organization, management and shutdown of 
automated or data-protection-compliant personal data processing operations."
"The Rheinmetall Group companies 
that process personal data or arrange to have it processed are responsible for ensuring that the procedures in 
place for processing this personal data function reliably and appropriately."
"To ensure effective implementation of 
data protection requirements, the DPMS sets out the possibilities and limitations for allocation and 
responsibilities for processes and requirements."
The companies of the Rheinmetall Group take a variety of steps to ensure the protection of personal data.
"The 
DPMS contains standards for data-protection-related processes."
"In the Rheinmetall Group, the implementation of 
data protection requirements for the global handling of personal data is regulated by the data protection rules and 
specified further by the data protection manual on the DPMS for the EU/EEA jurisdiction."
"By means of the DPMS, 
Rheinmetall establishes an appropriate level of data protection worldwide for processing personal data."
"Control 
processes and documentation requirements for the findings of data-protection-related processes and controls are 
also being implemented."
"Intensive data protection training courses have been held to 
assist them."
"Training and advice 
To make employees at all levels of the company aware of compliance risks, numerous introduction events, training 
seminars and workshops are held, some of which are tailored to specific functions such as management, buyers 
or sales staff."
"Legislation and important regulations are explained and further content is provided at these 
sessions."
"Attention is also drawn to internal compliance requirements, risks and possible sanctions and, based 
on case studies, practical advice is given on appropriate conduct in specific situations during everyday work."
"These classroom training sessions, which also serve as a practical forum for discussions, are accompanied by 
interactive online programs."
"The compliance training matrix, which forms part of the procedural instructions for compliance training, provides 
an overview of the training content geared toward the different target groups and management levels."
"Its content 
is adjusted in accordance with the needs of the participants or supplemented with country-specific or regional 
peculiarities."
"In the past fiscal year, some 8,700 participants attended classroom training sessions on various 
compliance topics."
"In addition, around 2,500 compliance-relevant e-learning modules were completed in the year 
under review."
Our employees also receive regular instruction and training in matters relating to data protection.
"The content of 
data protection training is adapted for individual departments in line with the specific requirements in their 
spheres of work."
"The relevant departments here were selected on the basis of data protection and compliance 
risks."
"For new employees, general data protection training is part of the onboarding process."
"A new e-learning 
module was also introduced in the past fiscal year and is available in numerous languages."
"In addition, all levels 
of the company are provided with data protection advice on an ad hoc basis."
"Most important financial management indicators 
As derived from the strategic objectives, in the Rheinmetall Group, the divisions are managed and the economic 
success of the operational entities is assessed using the three most important financial indicators – i.e."
"three core 
performance indicators as defined by the German Accounting Standard No."
"The figure for the 
previous year was also adjusted accordingly (previous year pro forma €754 million)."
"In light of the acquisition of the munitions manufacturer Expal Systems S.A.U., which was completed on July 31, 
2023, the definition of the operating result performance indicator was modified to take account of the effects of 
the purchase price allocation for this transaction."
"The prior-period figures have been 
restated to take account of remeasurement effects in connection with purchase price allocations."
"The 
reconciliation can be found in the economic report under »Rheinmetall Group business performance – results of 
operations."
"Operating free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing 
activities, for investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment property."
"The return on capital employed means the ratio of EBIT to average capital 
employed (average of values as of the balance sheet dates January 1 and December 31 of the year under review)."
"Capital employed on a reporting date is the sum of fixed assets, working capital and other assets and other 
liabilities."
"Furthermore, the level of capital expenditure and the research and development expenses are relevant financial 
indicators for the Rheinmetall Group."
"Non-financial indicators for the Rheinmetall Group include the headcount by full-time equivalent (FTE), the 
accident frequency rate (LTIR) and – in addition to energy efficiency, energy intensity and CO2 intensity – the 
volume of water used."
"Further development of key order figures 
At the beginning of fiscal year 2023, the existing key order figures were further developed with the aim of 
establishing a cross-segment indicator for Group-wide sales activity and the future sales potential of the 
Rheinmetall Group."
"As a new order indicator, Rheinmetall Backlog comprises the previously used order backlog key figure as well as 
the new frame backlog and nominated backlog key figures."
"The frame backlog reflects the expected future call-
offs from existing framework agreements for the security business, which are converted into order backlog when 
called off by the customer."
"Based on existing written agreements and framework contracts with customers, the 
nominated backlog figure shows the future call-offs expected for the civil business from these customer 
agreements."
"The sales resulting from the frame backlog and the nominated backlog may differ from the 
corresponding amounts depending on the final call-off quantities."
"The new Rheinmetall Nomination indicator is composed of the previously used order intake and booked business 
indicators as well as the new flow indicator for the security business, the frame nomination."
"Similarly to the 
booked business indicator used for the civil business, this represents the expected value of new framework 
agreements concluded with customers."
"Like booked business, frame nomination does not yet represent binding 
customer orders, so actual call-off volumes and the resulting sales may vary."
"The frame backlog is converted into 
order backlog by way of the call-offs reported as order intake."
"Within Rheinmetall Nomination, this change is 
presented as frame utilization."
"Strategy 
Rheinmetall at a glance 
In 1889, Hoerder Bergwerks- und Hüttenverein founded “Rheinische Metallwaaren- und Maschinenfabrik 
Actiengesellschaft” to supply munitions to the German Reich."
"In 1919, due to the provisions of the Treaty of 
Versailles, it switched to civilian products (locomotives, steam plows, office machines)."
"Military production 
resumed in 1921."
"Now in 2023, Rheinmetall is a leading, globally active, integrated technology group that develops 
and sells components, systems and services for the security and civil industries."
"As part of continuous analyses and assessments of the product portfolio, the realignment of the Group from a 
provider of security and mobility applications to a fully integrated technology group was initiated in 2020."
"In fiscal 
2021, this transformation was also supported by the discontinuation of the organizational separation into the 
previous Automotive and Defence sectors."
The technology transfer was further expanded as a result.
"Promising 
developments are incorporated in the different areas profitably, according to need and at a Group-wide level."
"Rheinmetall’s strategic alignment involves reducing its dependence on combustion engine products and divesting 
itself of the entire pistons business (small- and large-bore pistons)."
"At the start of 2023, the large-bore piston 
business was sold to the Swedish group Koncentra Verkstads AB."
"In December 2023, Rheinmetall and Comitans 
Capital AG signed a sale and purchase agreement for the entire small-bore business area."
"On March 20, 2023, the technology group Rheinmetall AG was included in Germany’s benchmark DAX index."
"This 
underlined the success of the company’s development over the course of 130 years."
"Rheinmetall has long been a 
fixture on the trading floor."
"Following the company’s founding in 1889 under the name “Rheinische Metallwaaren- 
und Maschinenfabrik Actiengesellschaft,” it went public in 1894."
"In 1996, the Düsseldorf-based company became 
a founding member of the MDAX (mid-cap DAX) and has been listed in this stock index without interruption ever 
since."
"Key market drivers for Rheinmetall 
Leap in growth in the defence sector – Numerous countries worldwide have responded to the war in Ukraine by 
increasing their defence spending."
"European countries such as France, Italy, Poland, Greece, the Baltic states and 
individual countries in Scandinavia have decided to expand their respective budgets and invest in equipment for 
their armed forces."
"But there has been a rise in defence spending in the US and in Asian countries such as China 
and Japan as well."
"Thus, as well as the need for conventional land-based weapon systems, 
demand in the areas of autonomy, digitalization, electrification, networked reconnaissance and communications 
is also rising sharply."
Digitalization – The growth of digitalization is continuing apace in both a civilian and security context.
"The 
connectedness of people and systems is becoming increasingly important for armed forces as a means of 
enhancing security and protecting the lives of soldiers."
"Acceleration of the energy transition – As an indirect consequence of the war, the planned energy transition has 
also been accelerated in order to reduce dependence on Russia in the energy sector."
"In this context, the Green 
Deal’s industrial policy instrument aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions was expanded to include the 
REPowerEU program adopted in May 2022."
"This includes both a tightening of targets and expanded measures and 
subsidies for the expansion of the hydrogen economy."
"Transformation of the automotive industry – As part of the energy transition, the shift in the vehicle drive mix 
toward electromobility has also advanced."
"For example, a mix of around 50% electric vehicles is currently assumed 
worldwide by 2030."
"Destabilization of value chains – The coronavirus pandemic and Ukraine war put the global supply chains under 
severe pressure, in 2022 especially."
Inflation rates were high.
"While inflation for producer prices actually slipped 
into minus in Q4 2023 compared with the same period of the previous year, certain components are still exposed 
to risks in the supply chain."

safety of drive commands and allow the vehicle configuration (blocking, gear reduction, etc.) to be adjusted 
automatically and on a situational basis in line with the environmental conditions."
"As part of close collaboration with sister company Rheinmetall Canada, which is developing the A-Kit (including 
the system for generating drive commands), two automated prototypes (HX trucks equipped with the A- and B-Kit) 
were manufactured – one with a protected cab and one without."
One of the vehicles is currently being tested by Rheinmetall Canada as part of the IDEaS project.
"The IDEaS project, 
which was initiated by the Canadian government, provides funding to accelerate innovation aimed at achieving 
excellence and security in the defence sector."
"More than 1,000 km have been covered in automated operation and 
in wintry conditions."
"The SIMPAS consortium project, which is funded by the Austrian Armed Forces, has been 
researching infrastructure-free automated driving with passive sensor technology in a completely virtual test 
environment since 2023."
"In late November 2023, the German armed forces showcased the progress achieved as 
part of the AuTP HX2 project in a successful “leader–follower” demonstration on difficult terrain in St."
"In the second quarter of 2023, following the outstanding performance in the digital design phase of the U.S."

the next generation of tactical vehicles was created with the help of the Integrated Digital Engineering Environment 
(IDEE)."
"The system architecture addresses the requirements of a two-soldier combat vehicle with the many 
associated requirements for the automation of crew functions and improvement of human–machine interfaces."
"Weapon and Ammunition 
Work was continued on weapons and ammunition, which aims to ensure the superiority of the company's own 
systems in the future too."
"Readily apparent is the range advantage of the 155 mm L52 artillery system 
(weapons/ammunition/propellants)."
"This lead was further extended with the development of the 155 mm L60 
weapon."
"Following the design phase and construction of an initial prototype, it successfully demonstrated its 
function in the first shot."
"Following verification of its practical feasibility, a new ammunition concept for the 120 mm L52 A1 tank weapon 
was developed to qualification maturity."
"Work began on the manufacture of ammunition for the official 
qualifications."
"Work on the fully automated 130 mm L52 weapon – together with the auto-loader, which is indispensable for the 
ammunition – was continued in order to further enhance stand-off capability in direct duel situations."
"The 
ammunition concept for the 120 mm L52 A1 weapon is being applied here to the 130 mm L52 weapon system."
"Based on the findings concerning drone-based stand-off capability, work began on arming the LUNA NG drone."
The proof of concept was provided after the definition phase.
New warheads are needed for the loitering munition and other weapon systems.
"New developments were initiated 
in this technological field too."
"The first warheads designed on the basis of existing products are to enter series 
production in the coming year."
The new SSW40 shoulder-fired weapon system is the next step toward increasing stand-off capability.
"Adapting 
the technology of a programmable airburst point of the High Velocity 40 mm HV ammunition also makes it possible 
to operate behind cover."
"A special field of R&D is drone defence by means of a high-frequency, multichannel, programmable jammer."
"The 
emission of electromagnetic signals suppresses the communication capabilities of drones."
"This includes ground-
based communication via an operator and also, optionally, autonomous control via satellite communication."
"The 
loss of communication capability can lead to the drone aborting its mission or even crashing."
"The research 
activities are currently culminating in a company qualification program, which means that a new product for use 
in stationary solutions in air defence as well as for vehicle-based self-protection solutions is expected to be 
available from 2025."
"Regarding future laser weapon systems, the laser weapon demonstrator (LWD) successfully completed its almost 
one-year trial aboard the Sachsen-class frigate."
"In a total of six campaigns, the LWD showcased its capabilities 
against various targets in increasingly complex scenarios under realistic operating conditions."
"All aspects were 
tested, from tracking – including highly agile targets – to the interaction of sensor technology, command and 
control/weapon deployment system and effector, possible rules of engagement and the successful combating of 
targets using high-energy laser radiation."
"Now that the almost one-year trial is complete, the client BAAINBw (Bundesamt für Ausrüstung, 
Informationstechnik und Nutzung der Bundeswehr) and the industry as a whole have gained important insights 
into the applications, performance and development potential of high-energy laser effectors."
"The demonstrator is 
now undergoing a detailed inspection and will then be transferred to Bundeswehr Technical Center 91 in Meppen 
for further testing."
"The results of the trials and tests are to be used to minimize the risk for the possible next phase: 
the development of an operational laser weapon system."
"The two companies involved in the consortium – MBDA Deutschland GmbH and Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH 
– have already started work in-house on preparing for the development phase within the respective spheres of 
responsibility."
"As in previous years, the focus of the protection technologies is on systems designed to protect protected combat 
or support vehicles."
"Thanks to the unique combination of active and passive protection technologies under one 
roof, important milestones for the integration of a complete protection concept were demonstrated with proof-of-
concept tests using the KF 51 Panther Evo as an example."
"The interaction of the different technologies as part of a 
holistic approach demonstrates above all the advantages in terms of weight balance: a higher level of protection 
with a lower system weight compared with imported systems."
Active protection also includes softkill systems.
"Tests have shown that the softkill system concept – interruption 
of the line of sight between the threat and target – can prove successful against threats targeting the roof 
structures of combat vehicles."
"The threats, which generally use seekers for end-phase steering, lose their target."
"A national study showed that the MASS (Multi Ammunition Softkill System) already deployed in the maritime 
sector to protect against autonomously approaching cruise missiles can also be deployed on land to protect 
critical infrastructure."

Another focus is on integrated sensor systems for body protection."
"For body protection systems, sensor systems 
are to be deployed as a potential means of detecting the effects of splinters and projectiles in order to potentially 
determine their direction of origin."
"Furthermore, the condition of the person exposed to the threat with their 
protection system is to be determined by monitoring the cardiovascular functions."
"Through the acquisition of Expal Munitions S.A.U., now Rheinmetall Expal Munitions, we now have the capability 
to develop rocket motors and the associated warheads."
"Work has begun on the development of systems for a 
variety of products, and this work is set to continue in the future."
"Electronic Solutions 
Digitalization, networking, cyber –Electronic Solutions encompasses the entire chain of effects in the system 
network, from sensors and the networking of platforms and soldiers to the (partially) automated connection of 
effectors."
"Some of this year's development outcomes were presented as part of the UK Ministry of Defence’s Army 
Warfighting Experiment (AWE) 2023."
"In close collaboration between the industry and customers, Electronic 
Solutions showcased the capabilities under the titles 3D4Land and Exploratores."
3D4Land represents a service that provides the very latest geodata as a 3D model of the area of operations.
"Sensor 
data can be integrated in the 3D model, while terrain evaluation, navigation by means of the Position Selection 
Assistant and target determination can be supported."
Exploratores uses AI to classify objects.
"This takes place, 
on the one hand, in the vision systems of a vehicle and, on the other, in quadcopter drones (of the “Mission Pod” 
product) for reconnaissance [2]."
"Coupling these two capabilities allows the drone to “lock in” to the 3D map and so find its way even when the GPS 
signal is disrupted."
AI methods are also used for positioning and navigation.
"Reconnaissance results reported in 
the network can now be transmitted to the effector (here: loitering munition) of the drone via target transfer and 
the effect can be triggered after approval by the operator."
"On-board sensor systems are also used to assess the 
impact at the target."
"In addition to the active use of drones, drone defence (C-UAS) is also a key area of R&D activity in Electronic 
Solutions."
"The full range of capabilities required for drone detection, reconnaissance and combat can now be 
covered."
These capabilities are based on tried-and-tested technologies (e.g.
"radars, electro-optical and infrared 
sensors, jammers)."
"And thanks to a range of software algorithms developed by R&D, these capabilities can now 
also be merged."
"The results 
confirm that only a holistic system approach can lead to an effective C-UAS (Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System)."
"In particular, the automation of the “OODA” (Orient–Observe–Decide–Act) loop to minimize reaction and combat 
times is essential for highly dynamic threat vectors."
"In the context of mobile C-UAS systems, a number of development activities were continued through 2023."
"The 
AMMR (AESA Multi-Mission Radar), for example, is now in its final test phase."
"The following selected functions 
underwent successful verification: search and tracking of drones, rockets, mortar rounds and standard targets as 
well as robustness against jamming from follow-on tracks."
"The product has now achieved a sufficient degree of 
maturity and is ready for further integration in the product range of Air Defence & Radar Systems (ADRS, e.g."
"The AMMR is intended to act as a search radar and primary sensor in the new multi-sensor unit 
(MSU), making it Rheinmetall’s most important new radar product."
"Research and development for civilian applications 
The ever-worsening global climate situation and resulting political regulations concerning climate-friendly 
measures on the road toward state-of-the-art, emissions-free transportation are exerting increasing pressure for 
change in many areas."
"In the transportation sector, this pressure can be felt especially keenly in the area of drive 
technologies, but is also increasingly relevant when it comes to energy supply and consumption in both industrial 
production and real estate."
"Rheinmetall is also focusing its attention increasingly on industrial 
segments and products, above all on systems and components for home heating installations."
"One important 
contribution here is a refrigerant compressor for a household heat pump."
"»Strategy 
Ongoing development work for the Rheinmetall curb charger for use in urban areas has received tremendous 
public attention and will be further intensified."
"While intensive talks are under way with potential customers – 
energy suppliers and local authorities above all – series implementation is in full swing."
"This covers not only 
technical product and industrialization development but also technical acceptance measures that permit 
installation in the public space."
"In addition, a joint project with the city of Cologne and TankE GmbH (Cologne-
based energy supplier) was launched in May 2023 for the installation of curb charging infrastructure on the city’s 
public roads."
"As part of the transportation revolution, Rheinmetall is also turning its attention to new, promising technologies 
and concepts for the transportation of tomorrow."
"Following the roll-out in Düsseldorf’s industrial port and a further 
successful demonstration campaign in partnership with Deutsche Telekom in Bonn, further public test sites are 
being prepared that will lead to the first relevant use cases with customers and partners in 2024."
"In addition to 
the further development of the fundamental technological elements, the vehicle fleet was also significantly 
expanded."
"Sensors and Actuators 
Our business with fuel cell components was systematically expanded through 2023, following the trend of a 
globally growing hydrogen and fuel cell market."
"This is demonstrated not only by the contact with now around 30 
international customers, but also by the orders for fuel cell cathode valves already booked with several customers."
"The high level of seal tightness achieved for the shut-off valves, as well as the possibility to offer an integrated 
electronic position control in all regions such as Europe, America and Asia, contribute significantly to this success."
"In general, the application areas for the various fuel cell products now range from all mobile sectors through to 
off-road and stationary as well as industrial applications."
"The strategic transformation of Sensors and Actuators in the area of digitalization is supported through the 
partnership with the Dutch company Incooling B.V."
"Incooling develops next generation 2-phase cooled servers 
that offer outstanding performance while significantly reducing energy consumption."
"»Strategy 
Regarding high-voltage safety switches, which are used to switch the high-voltage vehicle electrical system on and 
off safely, more components are currently under development in order to further expand the product portfolio."
"The 
switches are used to switch the high-voltage vehicle electrical system on and off safely."
"In particular, they must 
also be able to quickly and safely switch off the vehicle without voltage in the event of a short circuit or crash."
"They 
are extremely compact and lightweight and do not require the usual extinguishing gas filling, which eliminates the 
danger of bursting and ensures a longer service life."
"With a view to reducing dependence on internal combustion engines in general and diesel engines in particular, 
implementation in stationary, industrial applications with modification options is being pursued in parallel with 
automotive series business with modular refrigerant compressors."
"Research as part of the electrification strategy is focusing on the fast-growing markets for electric transportation 
and industrial applications."
"Rheinmetall is thus positioning itself to respond to the growing demand for e-mobility 
and green energy components, particularly in the automotive supply sector and also with its military customers."
"Advanced DC link capacitors featuring special NanoLam technology play an important role in the Rheinmetall 
PowerPack system for battery electric vehicles and that is currently under development."
"Rheinmetall expects the 
new PowerPack solution to deliver improved efficiency and increased range and thus market opportunities with 
major growth potential."
"Further progress was also made in the development of plain bearings for wind turbines and 
innovative components for hydrogen production, both of which are strategic projects in the context of the energy 
transition."
"In 2023, the Castings business unit worked on expanding its strategic project portfolio in the automotive, truck, 
e-mobility / new mobility and engineering service application areas."
"The primary focus here is on the application 
of expertise in the area of highly complex components."
"In addition, industrialization in the area of e-mobility / new 
mobility is being driven forward."
"In the area of automotive and motor applications, the focus remained on the 
series production of a complex cylinder crankcase (CCC) by means of low-pressure sand casting and on the 
expansion of process development for the series production of electric motor housings for electric drives."
"These 
developments are aimed at both the European and Asian markets and will lead to an expanded product and 
market portfolio."
"In addition, product developments for battery applications were also driven forward in the field 
of e-mobility."
"The successful series production run of a new product (support frame) for a European original 
equipment manufacturer deserves special mention."
"Another focus of 2023 was the industrialization of various 
lightweight construction applications outside the powertrain scope."
"In addition to the further development of 
existing structural and chassis components, work was also performed on new products for large, integrated, 
complex lightweight components."
"In 2023, Rheinmetall Invent GmbH continued the projects launched over previous years to open up new business 
areas and markets for Materials and Trade in the future markets of energy and mobility."
"With regard to energy 
recovery systems, series production began on the first customer projects, and some additional new customer 
application developments were acquired."
"In addition, initial prototypes for two areas of application (cabin 
air-conditioning and heat pumps) were produced and tested."
"The newly implemented business unit for hydrogen 
storage systems was launched in 2022 as part of a publicly funded project and is currently in the development 
and testing phase."
The targeted system benefits have been very well received by customers.
"Regarding glass-fiber-
reinforced springs, a number of customers have expressed their interest in this novel technology."
"Together with 
them, the fundamental qualification for future series projects was continued."
"Although a recession had been feared, particularly 
for industrialized nations, as a result of the central banks’ considerably more restrictive monetary policy, this did 
not materialize at a global level."
Global economic output probably grew by 3.0% in 2023.
"In 2022, growth had 
come to 3.5%."
"In the eurozone, gross domestic product (GDP) saw weak growth of 0.5% in the year under review."
Germany’s economic output contracted with a 0.3% decline in GDP in 2023.
"The US economy performed better, 
posting growth of 2.5% in gross domestic product in 2023."
"In China, growth was limited by increasing government 
regulation and the correction in the real estate sector."
"The Chinese economy recorded growth of 5.2% overall in 
the previous year."
"Inflation rates decreasing after significant interest rate hikes, but level still relatively high  
Inflation rates have recently displayed a noticeable downward trend, primarily due to lower raw material prices 
and the more expansionary monetary policy of central banks."
"The tightening of monetary policy in the US, the 
eurozone, and the United Kingdom is thus likely to have reached its peak on the whole."
"Nonetheless, inflation 
probably will not sustainably fall to around the central banks’ target levels again until the medium term."
"The global 
inflation rate probably came to 6.9% in 2023."
"For industrialized countries, an inflation rate of 4.7% is expected for 
2023."
The anticipated inflation rate for emerging and developing countries in 2023 is 8.5%.
"For Germany, the 
Federal Statistical Office has reported an inflation rate of 5.9% for last year."
"Increase in global defence spending 
Numerous countries worldwide have responded to the war in Ukraine by increasing their defence spending."
"European countries such as France, Poland, Greece, the Baltic states and individual countries in Scandinavia have 
decided to expand their national budgets and invest in equipment for their military."
"But there has been a rise in 
defence spending in the US and in Asian countries such as China and Japan as well."
"In the context of the Ukraine war, Germany already created a credit-financed special fund of €100 billion outside 
of the regular defence budget in 2022."
"As stated by the German chancellor, the approval of this special fund for 
the German armed forces was “the right response to the change of times.” The background to this was also 
Russia’s attack on Ukraine, which represented a turning point in security policies in Europe."
"The special fund is 
intended to help provide the German armed forces with the equipment it needs more quickly than is possible in 
the usual annual budget cycle in order to sustainably strengthen the armed forces’ combat readiness."
"Besides the 
special fund, which will be available for various equipment programs in the years to come, the regular defence 
budget for 2023 is estimated to be comparable to last year at a little over €50 billion."
"Around another €8.4 billion 
was estimated to have come from the special fund last year."
"Germany is not the only country to have responded to the changed threat situation by increasing its defence 
spending."
"Overall, global defence spending in 2023 probably increased by $2.1 billion to $2,327.3 billion (previous 
year: $2,115.3 billion)."
"In the US, the country with the biggest defence budget, the budget for 2023 was 5.7% higher than the previous 
year’s figure at $909.7 billion."
"By contrast, the United Kingdom reduced its defence budget by 10.8%."
"In France, 
spending increased by 1.2%."
"Hungary, an increasingly important NATO partner for Rheinmetall, again recorded a 
significant increase of 36.6%."
"The experts at Jane’s Defence Budgets (JDB) also recorded an increase for the 
People’s Republic of China."
"In the world’s second-largest defence budget, spending rose by 7.3% to $263.1 billion."
Russia’s defence budget was 150.1% higher than in the previous year at $112.7 billion.
"In India, defence spending 
increased by 1.4% to $71.8 billion."
"This is evidenced by both major procurement projects in Germany and significant large orders from friendly 
nations."
"Electronic Solutions, Vehicle Systems, and Weapon and Ammunition, which all operate in the field of 
security and defence technology, thus once again proved to represent important sales drivers."
"They also made a 
significant contribution to improving the Group’s operating result."
"In addition to topping up and expanding framework contracts with the German armed forces for the delivery of 
artillery and tank ammunition, Rheinmetall was commissioned by the German armed forces to supply 367 
protected and unprotected logistics vehicles, for example."
"This represented another call-off from the framework 
agreement for load-handling systems concluded in June 2020."
"In addition to the vehicles, 1,830 load-handling 
platforms were ordered as exchangeable load carriers."
"The call-off has a gross order value of more than €285 
million."
"As part of its extensive assistance for Ukraine, the German federal government had commissioned Rheinmetall in 
August 2023 to deliver 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine."
"This order brings the number of Marder 
vehicles to be supplied to Ukraine by Rheinmetall to a total of 80."
"In March 2023, Rheinmetall had already started 
delivering some of the 20 infantry fighting vehicles commissioned by the German federal government for Ukraine."
"In addition to these, another 20 infantry fighting vehicles were commissioned from Rheinmetall in June 2023."
"This 
assistance also includes the establishment of the joint venture between Rheinmetall and the Ukrainian state-
owned company Ukrainian Defense Industry JSC."
"»Strategy 
Rheinmetall achieved another milestone with its reconnaissance drone LUNA NG in 2023."
"With the “air-supported 
unmanned short-range reconnaissance equipment, next generation” (LUNA NG), the Ukrainian armed forces were 
supplied with an air-supported reconnaissance system commissioned by the Federal Republic of Germany."
"The 
order placed had a value in the low tens of million euro."
"Rheinmetall thus made another important contribution to 
improve the capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces by means of superior technology."
"The LUNA NG system has 
already accumulated several thousand flying hours and proven itself in operations with international customers."
"In addition, the groundbreaking ceremony for a new Rheinmetall ammunition manufacturing plant in Várpalota, 
Hungary, was held in January 2023."
Production of 30mm medium-caliber ammunition is to begin this year.
"The 
product range will later be expanded to include additional types of ammunition, especially 155mm artillery 
ammunition for the Panzerhaubitze 2000 and 120mm ammunition for the Leopard 2 battle tank and potentially 
also for the Panther KF51 EVO."
"The gradual recovery of the automotive industry can be seen particularly 
in the sound production figures since the second half of the previous year."
"Growth rates are expected to 
consolidate in the coming months, however, with the increasing comparative base in particular curbing growth."
"The recent strong growth momentum, including in core automotive markets, was driven to a large extent by weak 
figures from the previous year."
These were due to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g.
"lockdowns in 
China) and the start of the war in Ukraine."
"In addition, the current geopolitical and general economic uncertainties 
are likely to result in subdued general economic demand and thus modest economic growth."
"The analysts at IHS Markit have found that the global production of light vehicles (vehicles under 6 t) increased 
by 9.0% year-on-year in 2023."
"A total number of 89.8 million vehicles were produced in the reporting period, 
around 7.4 million more than in 2022."
"On the international automotive markets, the development of production momentum in 2023 varied."
"In Asia, 
Japanese production of light vehicles grew substantially by 15.8% year-on-year, whereas in China a lower increase 
in production of 8.5% was recorded."
"Production in the USMCA free-trade zone (formerly NAFTA) was increased by 
9.0%."
"In South America, year-on-year growth in production came to 3.2%."
"Western Europe (including Germany) 
saw a significant production increase of 12.9% in 2023."
"For Eastern Europe, almost identical growth of 12.8% was 
recorded."
"In Germany, the national automotive association VDA estimates that 4.1 million cars were produced in 2023, 
18.0% more than in 2022."
"Despite the positive trend in the past few months, production volumes are still lower 
than they were before the COVID crisis."
"Looking at exports, 3.1 million vehicles were delivered to customers all 
around the world in 2023, representing a year-on-year increase of 17.0%."
"The number of new registrations in 2023 
came to 2.8 million, meaning that 7.0% more vehicles were registered overall than in the previous year."
Production of passenger cars and light-duty commercial vehicles up to 6.0 t in million units.
"Source: IHS Markit, January 9, 2023 
Commercial vehicle market continues to grow 
In the EU commercial vehicle market, a 16.8% increase in new registrations was achieved over the first nine 
months of 2023."
"Trucks increased by 23.0% year-on-year, vans by 14.3%, and buses by 18.5% compared to the 
same period of the previous year."
"According to the industry association VDA, Germany recorded a 15.0% increase in new registrations of commercial 
vehicles in 2023, with registrations of trucks weighing more than 16 t rising by 25.0%."
"The increase for commercial 
vehicles weighing more than 2 t and up to 3.5 t was 12.0%, while for commercial vehicles weighing between 6 t 
and 16 t it came to 18.0%."
"For new registrations of buses, growth of 12.0% year-on-year was reported for 2023."
"Rheinmetall successful in the electromobility market  
The transformation of the automotive industry regarding alternative drive systems is still leading to new 
challenges."
"For example, many automotive manufacturers have announced their departure from the established 
internal combustion engine in anticipation of the expected legislative regulations."
"Almost all manufacturers now 
offer corresponding purely battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles."
"A total of around 700,200 electric vehicles have been registered in Germany since 
the beginning of the year."
"It remains to be seen how the decision as of December 18, 2023 to discontinue the 
subsidy for sales of electrically powered vehicles (environmental bonus) will impact sales volumes in this segment 
in the future."
"As part of its strategic realignment, Rheinmetall has defined the electrification of drive systems as a growth driver 
for future business and is developing innovative products for this market."
"Sensors and Actuators in particular is 
driving forward the electrification strategy."
"Rheinmetall presses ahead with hydrogen strategy 
In addition to battery-electric drive systems, regeneratively produced hydrogen is also becoming increasingly 
popular as an energy carrier in many countries."
"Hydrogen will play a key role in industry, shipping and synthetic 
aviation fuels."
"As far as passenger and freight transportation on land is concerned, the focus is on the use of 
hydrogen in fuel cell systems for commercial vehicles to achieve the ranges possible with fossil fuels."
"However, at 
present there is still a lack of sufficient refueling stations and of series-production vehicles that are affordable for 
a broad range of buyers."
"In connection with research into new drive systems, Rheinmetall is also pressing ahead with its hydrogen strategy."
"For example, in the past fiscal year Rheinmetall received two initial orders from one of the biggest international 
commercial vehicle manufacturers for coolant control values for use in fuel-cell-powered trucks."
"Fuel cells 
represent a key carbon-neutral drive solution, particularly for heavy-duty trucks."
"In addition, Rheinmetall received 
two more orders for the delivery of fuel cell components in the area of cathode and shut-off valves."
"The customers 
come from the North America region."
"Successful transformation in civilian business – Rheinmetall succeeds in further diversification 
In fiscal 2023, Rheinmetall also successfully continued the diversification strategy in the industrial sector."
"Rheinmetall’s high level of development expertise enables it to make technologies available specifically and 
precisely for a wide range of applications."
"Added to this are the global production network and worldwide 
proximity to customers, which make Rheinmetall a competent and sought-after partner for industrial customers – 
far beyond the automotive industry."
"This sales success once again underscores Rheinmetall’s strategic goal of further successfully diversifying its 
global business and contributing to the worldwide reduction of CO2 emissions."
"Metal and energy markets in 2023  
Due to the high volumes of metal alloys from aluminum, copper, nickel and tin purchased and the energy 
requirements (electricity and gas) for the manufacture of Rheinmetall products, developments on the metal and 
energy markets are of great importance to us."
"After the feared supply shock in 2022 as a result of the Ukraine war, the situation eased significantly in 2023."
"Firstly, it turned out that global trade flows were able to adapt much faster than expected despite extensive 
sanctions on the Russian energy sector."
"Secondly, fears of supply bottlenecks soon gave way to concerns over 
demand in connection with the aggressive tightening of monetary policy, especially in the US, and a disappointing 
post-COVID economic recovery in China."
"Sanctions and voluntary renunciations in relation to Russian metal and energy exports have led to significant 
rerouting of global supply chains."
"Russia is increasingly turning to China and India, while Europe is importing 
considerably more energy from the US."
"With regard to metals, many Europeans are avoiding Russian metal, but 
the market has so far remained liquid."
"Despite strict sanctions in the energy sector, Russian exports still found 
their way into western countries via indirect routes."
"Industrial metals were under pressure for most of the year, but caught up some ground again in the last few 
months."
There has recently been support for prices from several sides at once.
"Firstly, the economic outlook in 
general has brightened, as the US Federal Reserve and its European counterpart, the ECB, seem to have reached 
the end of their interest rate hikes."
"Secondly, market participants are more optimistic again about the biggest 
sales market, China, now that the government in Beijing is increasingly taking measures to support the economy."
"Aluminum and copper prices in 2023 €/t

The risk of a gas shortage in Europe was averted due to various factors."
"The mild temperatures in the winter half 
of the year and the low level of industrial activity reduced demand, while supply was expanded, particularly with 
LNG."
"In addition, government measures helped alleviate uncertainty among market participants."
"The year-ahead 
price consequently fell by 53% over the course of the year."
"Although prices have decreased significantly again, a 
return to levels below €20 per MWh for Europe remains unrealistic."
"Expiring government assistance, growing 
demand, and disruptions to LNG deliveries still represent risk factors."
"There are also continued dependencies on 
Russia, resulting in an ongoing risk of deliveries being suspended due to intervention by Russia or the EU."
Electricity prices fell in step with gas.
"The increasing generation of renewable energy also helped reduce power 
generation prices."
"More innovative large-scale storage solutions combined with the expansion of renewable 
energy still have the potential to uncouple electricity and gas prices from one another."
"In addition, the EU is still 
conducting negotiations with regard to reforming the design of the electricity markets, which is intended to 
stabilize these markets in the long term."
"The figure for the previous 
year 2022 was also adjusted accordingly."
"2 In accordance with the changes made to the Group structure as at 1 October 2023, the reported prior-year figures were adjusted."
"Given 
the changed security policy situation, the Group sees itself in a promising position to play a key role in the 
upcoming increase in defence capability with military products in Germany and partner countries."
"In the field of 
security technology, we expected fiscal 2023 to see sales growth of between 25% and 30% for Vehicle Systems 
and Weapon and Ammunition and sales growth of between 15% and 20% for Electronic Solutions."
"In the civilian 
segment, we expected slight sales growth of between 5% and 8% for Sensors and Actuators and between 4% and 
7% for Materials and Trade based on the forecast development of international light vehicle production in fiscal 
2023 and expected growth in the truck business."
"For the Group as a whole, we planned to generate an operating margin of roughly 12%."
"We expected an operating 
margin of between 11% and 13% for Vehicle Systems and Electronic Solutions and between 20% and 22% for 
Weapon and Ammunition."
"We expected Sensors and Actuators to generate an operating profit margin of between 
7% and 9%, and that of Materials and Trade was projected to be within a range of between 9% and 11%."
"As for operating free cash flow, we anticipated an improvement to 4 - 6% (previous year: -2.4%)."
"Q1 | 2023 — Under the assumption that our expectations in regard to development prospects remained valid, we 
retained the full-year forecast for sales growth, operating profit margin, and operating free cash flow published in 
mid-March 2023."
"We continued to expect positive general conditions in the security technology sector and a 
slower recovery for automotive markets."
"For fiscal 2023, we expected operating sales growth to a level of €7.4 - 7.6 billion (2022 sales: €6,410 million) and 
an operating margin of roughly 12% (2022 margin: 12.0 %)."
"Q2 | 2023 — We assumed that our expectations in regard to development prospects remained valid and retained 
the full-year forecast for sales growth, operating profit margin, and operating free cash flow published in mid-
March 2023."
"We continued to expect positive general conditions in the security technology sector and a slower 
recovery for automotive markets."
"We continued to expect 2023 to see operating sales growth to a level of €7.4 - 7.6 billion (2022 sales: 
€6,410 million) and an operating margin of roughly 12% (2022 operating margin: 12.0 %)."
"Q3 | 2023 — After nine months of fiscal 2023, we confirmed the current annual forecasts."
"Dynamic performance 
on the market for security technology – especially in Weapon and Ammunition– led to a favorable product and 
margin mix in the third quarter."
Rheinmetall AG continued its expected course of growth and expansion in the 2023 fiscal year.
"With consolidated 
sales of €7.2 billion in the 2023 fiscal year, the deviation from the forecast sales growth of €7.4 billion to €7.6 
billion was due to postponements of deliveries in the areas of ammunition and vehicles until 2024."
"The operating 
result is slightly above the guidance of >12%."
The OFCF is within expectations of 4-6%.
"Further information on developments in the year under review can be found in »Rheinmetall Group business 
performance and »Notes on Rheinmetall AG."
"The share purchase agreement covers Rheinmetall's large-bore pistons business with three 
production plants in Germany, the US and China as well as the steel pistons line from the small-bore pistons plant 
in Marinette, US."
"The transaction was closed on January 27, 2023, and includes the deconsolidation of the Group 
companies belonging to the large-bore pistons business."
"The deconsolidation gain based on the final purchase 
price is €14 million."
"On March 22, 2023, Rheinmetall and Riken Corporation, Tokyo, Japan, concluded a purchase agreement for all of 
the shares previously held by Rheinmetall in the Riken Automobile Parts (Wuhan) Co., Ltd."
"The sale of shares was 
completed on April 5, 2023."
The transaction did not result in any significant deconsolidation result.
An important step was taken at the end of 2023 with regard to the small-bore pistons business.
Business operations and production are to be continued at all locations.
"They are aiming to close the 
transaction, which is still subject to approval by the relevant authorities, as of March 31, 2024."

"This work 
will include the construction and qualification of a demonstration product to prepare for series production."
"Rheinmetall is cooperating on this project with the state-owned Hungarian holding company N7, which also holds 
a 49% stake in the joint venture Rheinmetall Hungary."
"Rheinmetall had presented the concept to the global public 
for the first time at the Eurosatory trade fair in 2022."
"In contrast to the demonstration system presented at this 
trade fair in Paris, the Panther KF51 HUN will feature Rheinmetall’s tried-and-tested 120mm smooth-bore gun 
L55A1, which is also installed in the latest Leopard 2 versions."
"This is intended to ensure logistical equivalence 
with the Hungarian Leopard 2 fleet."
"Nonetheless, the Panther KF51 HUN will already have an auto-loader."
"The turret 
architecture will also allow for subsequent installation of the Rheinmetall 130mm weapon."
"This meant that sales were 
up by €766 million or 11.9% on the previous year’s figure."
"Adjusted for exchange rate and M&A effects of 
€88 million, sales growth was 10.6%."
"The segments in the area of security technology, in particular, contributed to the growth in sales in fiscal year 
2023."
"The growth was particularly apparent in Vehicle Systems (€339 million, 15 %) and Weapon and Ammunition 
(€397 million, 29 %)."
"These segments benefited from rising demand as a result of the turning point in security 
policy ushered in by the Ukraine war."
"At 76%, the international share of consolidated sales in the year under review 
was higher than the previous year’s figure of 71 %."
"€1,723 million or 24% (previous year: 29%) of consolidated sales was attributable to sales generated in Germany."
"The proportion of sales generated with customers in the rest of Europe was €3,399 million or 47% (previous year: 
36%)."
"The Americas region has a sales share of 8% (previous year: 9%) and the Asia region (including the Near 
East) a share of 11% (previous year: 16%)."
"In the other regions – above all Australia – sales of €642 million were 
generated, accounting for 9% of total sales (previous year: 10%)."
"Order information 
The year 2023 was characterized by significantly increased market demand for security technology products."
"Rheinmetall profited from this trend with its products, and Rheinmetall nominations more than doubled year on 
year to reach €19.9 billion."
"As a result, the Rheinmetall backlog also increased to a new record high of 
€38.3 billion."
"The Group’s operating margin was 12.8%, which was also higher than 
the previous year’s figure of 12.0 %."
The growth in earnings resulted exclusively from the Group's activities in the area of security technology.
"The 
significant growth in sales saw Weapon and Ammunition increase its operating result to €403 million 
(+€106 million, +36%), thus making the biggest earnings contribution once again (previous year: €297 million)."
"In addition, Vehicle Systems saw a considerable earnings increase of 24% to €324 million (previous year: 
€261 million)."
"The operating result in fiscal year 2023 was adjusted for positive special items totaling €49 million and PPA effects 
amounting to €‑70 million."
"The special items resulting from corporate transactions related primarily to income in 
connection with the sales of the shares in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
"The PPA effects in 2023 
relate primarily to the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"(€21 million), which is accounted for using the equity method."
These effects at 4iG Nyrt.
result mainly from the acquisition of Vodafone Hungary at the end of 2022.
Special items of €‑22 million and PPA effects of €‑10 million were recognized in the previous year.
"These special 
items related primarily to write-downs due to the volatile capital market situation of the fund units held for trading 
(strategic liquidity reserve) as well as subsequent income from the sale of land to a joint venture in 2018."
"Taking into account the special items and PPA effects, EBIT in the Rheinmetall Group was €897 million and thus 
€160 million above the previous year’s figure of €738 million."
"EBIT before PPA effects reached €968 million after 
a figure of €747 million in the previous year."
"Significant income and expenses 
After reversals of warranty provisions during the previous year, other operating income fell from €221 million to 
€153 million."
"The cost of materials increased to €3,935 million (+23.6 %, previous year's figure €3,183 million) in fiscal year 
2023 as a result of the expansion of the business volume."
"The cost of materials ratio increased from 49.6% to 
54.8%, in particular due to the significantly increased changes in inventories of finished goods and work in 
progress."
"Personnel increased, in particular, at Weapon and Ammunition and Vehicle Systems, where the average 
headcount rose by 19% and 15%."
"The increase in headcount at Weapon and Ammunition includes 1,196 employees 
taken on as part of the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"Amortization (including PPA effects) rose significantly in fiscal year 2023 from €249 million to €308 million due to 
the increased investment volume and the PPA effects due to the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
Other operating expenses increased by €121 million to €889 million in fiscal year 2023.
"The increase of 15.7 % 
remained below the increase in total operating performance (20.0 %)."
"The increase in other operating expenses 
is mainly due to the expansion of operating activities."
"This is particularly reflected in the operating costs and travel 
expenses."
Operating costs increased by 30.4 % to €175 million.
"Travel expenses increased from €44 million to 
€58 million."
"The increase was also driven by IT costs, which increased from €130 million to €159 million in the 
context of the ongoing IT transformation."
"The increase in the result from investments accounted for using the equity method from €39 million in 2022 to 
€57 million in the year under review is mainly due to the income shown as special effects in connection with the 
sale of the shares in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd (€59 million)."
"This was offset by the earnings contribution of the 
investment in 4iG Nyrt., which was also burdened by PPA effects of €21 million in 2023."
"Other net financial income 
reached €‑6 million in the year under review."
"The previous year’s figure of €‑48 million was influenced in particular 
by write-downs on fund units held for trading (strategic liquidity reserve), which were not included as a special 
item in the operating result."
"Net interest income was €‑82 million in fiscal year 2023, compared with €‑20 million in the previous year."
"Of this 
increase, €35 million is attributable to the interest costs of the convertible bond issued at the start of 2023."
"The 
funds received were mainly used to pay the purchase price for the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"at the end 
of July 2023."
"Interest on the Group’s pension obligations increased by €9 million to €15 million as a result of 
increases in the relevant interest rates."
"Due to higher advance payments, particularly in Weapon and Ammunition, 
interest for financing components in accordance with IFRS 15 also increased by €9 million to €13 million."
"The Rheinmetall Group’s earnings before taxes (EBT) amounted to €815 million compared with €718 million in the 
previous year."
"Despite the increase in earnings before taxes, the tax expense increased only slightly from €183 million to 
€185 million."
One significant factor was the largely tax-exempt sale of shares in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd.
"In 
addition, tax credits that were not previously evaluated were capitalized due to positive corporate planning."
Earnings from continued operations improved by 18.0 % to €630 million.
"Earnings from discontinued operations 
deteriorated due to the necessary write-downs on the assets of small-bore operations from €6 million to 
€‑44 million."
"As a result, earnings after taxes reached €586 million, thus exceeding the previous year’s figure of €540 million."
"After deduction of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests of €51 million (previous year: €66 million), 
earnings attributable to shareholders of Rheinmetall AG were €535 million, compared with €474 million in the 
previous year."
"Taking into account the weighted number of shares (2023: 43.41 million shares; 2022: 43.36 million 
shares), earnings per share came to €12.32 , compared with €10.94 in the previous year."
"Earnings per share from 
continuing operations increased from €10.80 to €13.34."
"In the context of the turning point as a result of the Ukraine war, the Group invested more in the expansion of 
capacity and the construction of new production sites."
"This meant that capital expenditure of continuing 
operations on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to €487 million in fiscal year 2022, 
compared with €352 million in the previous year."
"This is equivalent to 6.8 % of consolidated sales (previous year: 
5.5 %)."
"€111 million of the capital expenditure volume of continuing operations related to leases as per IFRS 16 
(previous year: €37 million) and therefore did not affect cash."
"Capital expenditure was offset by depreciation and 
amortization of €308 million (previous year: €249 million)."
2 Previous year’s figures restated.
"Vehicle Systems invested a total of €168 million in fiscal year 2023, compared with €127 million in the previous 
year."
The increase of €41 million was essentially due to investments in plants and facilities for capacity expansion.
The investments were driven by a lease for the new plant in Hungary.
"Investment also focused on expanding and 
updating information technology to address the growing product portfolio and internationality, including in the IT 
system landscape."
"As in the previous year, there was also extensive capital expenditure in development work to 
expand the existing and future product portfolio."
"This particularly included development work for the Panther 
project."
A total of €112 million was invested in Weapon and Ammunition in fiscal year 2023 (previous year: €53 million).
"The biggest individual investment was the establishment of a new production site in Várpalota, Hungary."
"A 
production facility for medium and large calibers and for artillery ammunition and detonators is to be built at the 
Hungarian site in the coming years."
"In addition, various investment programs for capacity expansion were initiated 
– for example, at Rheinmetall Waffe Munition in Unterlüß and at Rheinmetall Denel Munition in South Africa."
"The 
construction of a woodchip cogeneration plant in Unterlüß for the sustainable generation of electricity and heat 
from renewable resources was also completed."
"The total capital expenditure of Electronic Solutions amounted to €48 million in the year under review, compared 
with €33 million in the previous year."
"At the Bremen site, work on a demonstrator for anti-tank guided missiles 
was continued in addition to the cross-divisional artillery demonstrator development project."
"Other capital 
expenditure related to the modernization of IT equipment and infrastructure."
"At the Zurich site, the main 
investments were made in connection with the production of reference devices and the modernization and 
expansion of machinery."
"As in previous years, the focus of investment at the Rome site was on the further 
development of airspace radar technology to expand the product range."
"At both the Zurich and the Bremen site, 
work on the Panther battle tank was continued."
"The 
reasons for this increase include the capitalization of higher development costs in connection with the 
technological shift away from combustion engines and towards alternative drive systems and non-automotive 
applications."
"Another focus of investment in 2023 was at the Abadiano site in Spain, where production facilities 
for pollutant-reducing products such as exhaust gas recirculation valves and secondary air systems were 
established."
"At the Hartha site in Germany, investments were made in fuel cell and electric motor components."
Capital expenditure at Materials and Trade in 2023 was similar to the previous year and amounted to €15 million.
"The Bearings business unit invested in capacity expansion for polymer bearing shells, plants and facilities for the 
production of polymer-coated thrust washers, CNC hard turning machines and tools."
"In addition, investments were 
made in future-oriented areas such as the production of components for industrial applications and for generating 
green energy."
"In the Trade business unit, investment included the first phases of construction of a new logistics 
center at the site in Neuenstadt and right-of-use assets for buildings, equipment and vehicles."
"The largest real estate 
investments in 2023 include the property in Bristol, which is the new headquarters of the Vehicle Systems 
International division, and the new Weeze site where the F-35 center fuselage section will be produced."
"The largest 
IT investments relate to the new data centers in Unterlüß."
"Statement of cash flows 
Cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations increased by a considerable €177 million from 
€563 million in the previous year to €740 million in fiscal year 2023."
"Despite the substantial increase in business 
volume, the increase in working capital was markedly contained."
"In fiscal year 2023, only an additional 
€217 million was tied up in working capital, compared with €507 million in the same period of the previous year."
"In addition, following a figure of €62 million in the previous year, €20 million was paid into an external fund (CTA) 
in the year under review to cover provisions for pensions and partial retirement obligations."
"Furthermore, pension 
payments amounting to €8 million were reimbursed by the CTA."
"Payments for capital expenditure (continuing operations) increased from €327 million in the previous year to 
€384 million."
This is due in particular to the higher level of investment.
"Operating free cash flow from continuing 
operations – defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure on intangible assets, property, 
plant and equipment and investment property – accordingly improved from €‑151 million to €356 million."
"In the 
fiscal year, payments from divestments and acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Expal Systems 
S.A.U."
and the sale of large-bore piston activities and shares in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd.
"In the previous year, 
these related primarily to the purchase of the investment in 4iG Nyrt., Budapest, Hungary, (€165 million) and the 
acquisition of the activities of the drone manufacturer EMT Ingenieurgesellschaft Dipl.-Ing."
"Hartmut Euer mbH 
(EMT), including the land and buildings used by EMT, for €32 million."
"Cash flow from financing activities in the year under review was characterized by the issue of a convertible bond 
in the amount of €1 billion to finance the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"Net proceeds are calculated as the 
nominal value of the convertible bond less the transactions costs amounting to €7 million."
"The dividend paid out 
in the year under review for 2022 was €4.30 per share, compared with €3.30 per share in the previous year."
"In 
addition to the significant business growth, the key drivers of these changes were the acquisition of Expal Systems 
S.A.U."
and the convertible bond issued to finance it.
"This acquisition is also the decisive factor for the increase in 
non-current assets as at December 31, 2023 to €4,615 million."
"Of this increase by €1,697 million, €1,384 million 
is attributable to the acquisition."
The share of total assets increased from 36% to 39%.
"Current assets increased 
year on year overall by €1,914 million to €7,092 million."
"A total of €1,268 million of this increase was attributable 
to inventories and €473 million to trade receivables."
"As a result of the positive operating free cash flow, cash and 
cash equivalents also increased by €305 million."
"Assets held for sale (IFRS 5) reduced to €196 million (previous 
year: €349 million)."
"The reasons for this were the sales of the large-bore piston activities and the investment in 
Riken Automobile Parts (Wuhan) Co., Ltd."
as well as the write-downs of the small-bore piston activities.
"Asset and capital structure1  
€ million 
 Dec."
"The equity of the Rheinmetall Group increased significantly by €553 million or 18 % to €3,643 million in fiscal year 
2023."
"This increase results mainly from the positive earnings after taxes (€586 million) and the equity share of the 
convertible bond issued in 2023 (€113 million)."
"The 
principal drivers of the increase in non-current financial liabilities were the convertible bond issued at the start of 
February 2023 (as at December 31, 2023: €897 million) and newly concluded lease agreements (€54 million)."
"The 
increase in deferred taxes is the result of €153 million from the valuation of the assets and liabilities taken on as 
part of the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"Current liabilities increased by a considerable €1,794 million to €5,459 million."
"This was mainly driven by contract 
liabilities, particularly at Weapon and Ammunition, which increased by €1,474 million to €2,594 million due to 
improved payment terms for advance milestone payments."
Trade liabilities also increased by €291 million.
"In 
addition, liabilities directly related to assets held for sale of €161 million (previous year: €220 million) were 
recognized in accordance with IFRS 5."
"The decrease was mainly due to the successful sale of the large-bore piston 
activities at the start of 2023."
"Capital structure 1  
€ million 
 Dec."
"In relation to total assets adjusted for cash and cash equivalents, the equity ratio was 34%, compared with 39% 
in the previous year."
"Financial liabilities increased by €941 million or 96.9 % compared with the beginning of the 
year to €1,913 million."
"As of the end of the reporting period, cash and cash equivalents totaled €850 million, after 
€545 million at the end of the previous year."
"Despite the positive operating free cash flow, net financial debt of 
€‑1,063 million was still reported at the end of 2023 (previous year: €‑426 million)."
"This was due in particular to 
the financing of the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"The fund units held for trading (strategic liquidity reserve) 
not included in these figures were sold in full in 2023 (previous year: €132 million)."
ROCE reduced in the fiscal year from 21.4% to 19.9%.
"The decline can be attributed to the significant increase in 
capital employed following the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"Therefore, the principal aim of its financial management is to ensure that Rheinmetall remains solvent at all times."
"It also makes a positive contribution to enterprise value through the efficient implementation of financial 
transactions and the optimization of liquidity, capital structure, and contractual conditions."
"Within the scope of global cash management, liquidity at subsidiaries is pooled centrally and made available to 
Group companies based on their liquidity requirements."
"The overriding aim – solvency at all times – is secured in 
addition to the convertible bond and the promissory note loans on the one hand by means of a sufficient liquidity 
position and on the other hand by contractually agreed bilateral and syndicated credit facilities with banks."
"These 
can always be drawn on at short notice."
"In addition, with its investment grade rating and as a listed stock 
corporation, Rheinmetall has direct access to the money and capital markets at all times."
"Liquidity requirements 
are determined on the basis of rolling twelve-month liquidity outlooks and the three-year Group plan and are 
subjected to a stress test using actuarial model simulations."
"The knowledge gained from this is used to ensure 
Rheinmetall’s solvency at all times, even in worst-case scenarios."
"Financial risks from changes in currencies, interest rates, raw materials, or energy prices are recorded, assessed 
and managed centrally."
This also applies to country and counterparty risks.
"Risk-mitigating effects are 
implemented through the management measures with the aim of safeguarding the profitability of ongoing 
business operations and Rheinmetall’s assets."
"Furthermore, implemented contractual structures and, where 
required, use of primary and derivative financial instruments serve to mitigate potentially negative effects on 
earnings or assets."
"To achieve its aims, Rheinmetall follows the principle of financial independence from individual banks and 
financial service providers and the prevention of cluster risks."
"For this reason, Rheinmetall has a broadly 
diversified portfolio of national and international financial partners for every service involved in processing 
operational business."
Creditworthiness-linked counterparty limits are also used to limit financial default risks.
"In addition to the conceptual approaches, financial management also follows strict organizational guidelines, 
such as strict adherence to the principle of dual control and the separation of implementation, processing, and 
checking in the front, middle, and back offices."
"This ensures compliance with legal requirements and that financial 
instruments are used exclusively in connection with operating business and not for speculative purposes."
"Other 
important principles include ensuring that data is secure and that transactions are documented so that they can 
be traced."
"Financing in the Rheinmetall Group 
Rheinmetall covers its operating financial requirements using a mix of existing liquidity sources across the Group 
and external, short- and long-term negotiated financial instruments."
"Here, the financing elements used are broadly 
diversified in terms of sources, maturities and instruments, and the associated costs are also optimized."
"This 
secures sufficient financing scope at all times, even if conditions change."
"In addition to the approach described 
for the operating business, long-term real estate loans are also used for investments or development loans, for 
example to finance research and development activities."
"Rheinmetall’s long-term financing comprises four main elements: convertible bond, various promissory note 
loans, development loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB), and a syndicated credit facility."
The convertible bond is due in two tranches of €500 million each in 2028 and 2030.
"The volume of promissory note loans amounted to €428 million at the end of the year and covers maturities from 
2024 to 2029."

The EIB development loan of €80 million was disbursed in 2022 and will mature in December 2028."
"The EIB is 
using these funds to support research and development activities focusing on sustainable and intelligent mobility 
solutions in the civil areas."
"As in the previous year, the syndicated credit facility involving twelve national and international banks has a 
volume of €500 million."
"It is used for general corporate financing and also serves as a back-up facility for the 
commercial paper program in the same volume."
"Bilaterally committed cash and guarantee credit facilities from various banks and insurance companies with a 
total volume of €3.3 billion round off Rheinmetall’s financing profile."
"By the end of the year, around €1.4 billion or 
53% of the guarantee credit facilities and rounded €0 million or 0% of the cash credit facilities had been drawn."
There are also real estate loans and other subsidised loans totaling €12 million.
"At the end of the year, the trust assets used to finance liabilities from the company pension scheme or as 
insolvency protection in connection with semi-retirement models and working time accounts were valued at 
€237 million."
"For the first time since establishment of the trust in 2016, reimbursements of €8 million were paid 
for pension payments made by Rheinmetall AG during the year."
"Additions were made in fiscal year 2023 in the 
amount of €20 million."
"For the new “Rheinmetall Plus 2.0” company pension scheme introduced in 2022, monthly 
contributions have been paid into the trust assets on an ongoing basis since January 2022."
"The investment of the 
funds is based on a lifecycle model and takes place in various portfolios that ensure risk diversification."
Contributions totaling €20 million were paid over the course of 2023.
"At the end of the year, the trust assets 
allocated to Rheinmetall Plus 2.0 amounted to €30 million."
"Financing activities in fiscal year 2023 
In fiscal year 2023, Rheinmetall AG exercised the second extension option for the syndicated credit facility of 
€500 million."
"The original five-year term, which was already extended by one year when the first extension option 
was exercised in 2022, was thus extended by an additional year to September 2028, increasing Rheinmetall’s 
financing security for the next few years."
The extension was made with the approval of all twelve syndicate banks.
"At the end of 2023, the credit facility had not been utilized."
"As of December 31, 2023, €216 million had been used 
under the commercial paper program, which likewise amounts to €500 million."
"The weighted average interest rate 
was 4.36%."
"As part of financial risk management, sales of receivables have been carried out on a situational basis as part of 
supplier finance solutions, forfeiting, or comparable instruments."
"At the same time, sale without recourse passes 
any potential customer default risk to the acquirer."
"The volume of receivables sold amounted to €26 million 
(previous year: €66 million) as of December 31, 2023."
"Convertible bond to finance the acquisition of Expal Systems  
On January 31, 2023, Rheinmetall AG issued a convertible bond with a total nominal value of €1 billion in two 
tranches of €500 million."
"The first tranche, maturing on February 7, 2028, has an annual coupon of 1.875%."
"The 
second tranche with an annual coupon of 2.250% matures on February 7, 2030."
"The net proceeds from the issue 
of the convertible bond were used to finance the acquisition of the ammunition manufacturer Expal Systems 
S.A.U., which was agreed in November 2022 and completed in summer 2023."
"As a result of the issuance of the 
convertible bond, the authorization of the Executive Board granted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting 
on May 21, 2021, to issue bonds with warrants and convertible bonds was partially utilized."
"Promissory note loans issued with a total volume of €175 million 
Rheinmetall AG issued six promissory note loans with a total volume of €175 million in January and November 
2023."
"The promissory note loans with terms of three and five years bear a variable rate of interest and serve the 
Rheinmetall Group’s general financing."
"Since April 26, 2022, Moody’s has awarded Rheinmetall a rating of “Baa2 stable outlook.” This rating 
did not change after the acquisition of the Spanish Expal Systems S.A.U.."
"Moody’s commented positively on the 
strategic dimension of the transaction."
"In the other segments, the segment corresponds to the respective division."
"The figure for the previous year 
was also adjusted accordingly."
"Sales –Vehicle Systems generated sales of €2,609 million in fiscal 2023, exceeding the previous year’s figure of 
€2,270 million by 14.9%."
"Adjusted for currency effects, growth amounted to 15.7%."
"In the Tactical Vehicles 
business unit, significant sales contributions were made by Lynx infantry fighting vehicles in Hungary and ring 
exchange programs in the context of the Ukraine war."
"The Logistic Vehicles business unit generated a large portion 
of its sales in fiscal 2023 from the delivery of load-handling systems to various customers and a range of logistics 
vehicles from the HX, TGS and TGM series."
"As in the previous year, a considerable share of sales was generated in 
connection with the major Land 400 Phase 2 Australian order, which includes a delivery of 211 8x8 Boxer wheeled 
armored vehicles."
"Rheinmetall Nomination – At €7,144 million, Rheinmetall Nomination of Vehicle Systems was €5,581 million 
higher than the previous year’s figure of €1,564 million."
"A framework agreement for air assault vehicles in Germany 
and the Netherlands totaling more than €1 billion was acquired in the year under review."
"At the same time, an 
order for XM30 infantry fighting vehicles of around €700 million was acquired in the US."
"Other major new orders 
included the second lot of Puma infantry fighting vehicles commissioned by the German government and the 
Leopard 2 upgrade for Norway."
"Rheinmetall Backlog –Vehicle Systems recorded an order backlog of €16,368 million in fiscal 2023, compared 
with €11,954 million in the previous year."
"Of this order backlog, €5,145 million is attributable to Germany, €2,921 
million to Hungary, €2,458 million to the United Kingdom, and €1,496 million to Australia."
"Operating result – In 2023, the operating result of Vehicle Systems improved by around €63 million 24.1 % to a 
total of €324 million."
"As a result of sales picking up for the orders described and strict cost management, the 
operating margin came to 12.4% and significantly exceeded the previous year’s figure of 11.5%."
"Operating free cash flow – Operating free cash flow of Vehicle Systems decreased by around €223 million year on 
year to €‑142 million."
"Employees –Vehicle Systems employed 6,437 people as of the end of the fiscal year (previous year:5,747)."
"This 
increase in employees reflects the financial success of the segment and is the result in particular of the recruitment 
of staff to process major orders in Germany, Great Britain, Australia and Hungary."
"The figure for the previous year 
was also adjusted accordingly."
"Sales –Weapon and Ammunition generated sales of €1,756 million in the year under review."
"Measured against 
the previous year, this represents an increase in sales of €397 million or 29.2%."
"In addition to Germany, significant 
growth impetus came from other NATO states in Eastern Europe and from Ukraine."
"Additional contributions came 
from the Spanish ammunition manufacturer Expal Systems S.A.U."
"(transfer of operating activities on August 1, 
2023) with sales of around €171 million in five months and from the Protection Systems business unit, which 
increased its sales by €51 million year-on-year mainly due to internal deliveries for protected vehicle cabins 
(around €143 million)."
"Rheinmetall Nomination –Weapon and Ammunition achieved a new record of €8,238 million, more than doubling 
nominations with a year-on-year increase of €4,979 million."
"Two (multi-year) framework agreements for tank 
ammunition (€3.2 billion) and artillery ammunition (€1.4 billion) with the German customer particularly stand out 
here."
"Reflecting the new European security situation, significant volumes have already been called off for artillery 
ammunition in particular."
"In addition to these call-offs, the increase in the order intake is largely due to direct 
orders from Ukraine of €1.7 billion."
"Rheinmetall Backlog – The order backlog increased significantly as a result of the consistently high order intake 
from countries such as Germany, Ukraine, the Netherlands and Australia."
"Based on the €4,577 million higher frame 
nominations and associated outstanding call-offs from framework contracts worth (€4.5 billion), Rheinmetall 
Backlog has increased by €6,698 million to a record level of €11,581 million."
"Operating result – The operating result of Weapon and Ammunition rose by €106 million to around €403 million 
in fiscal 2023 (previous year: €297 million), mainly due to the higher sales volume."
"The operating margin improved 
from 21.9% in the previous year to 23.0% in the year under review due to intensified cost optimization measures 
and a more profitable product mix in the traditional ammunition business."
"This includes an contribution of €37 
million from the acquired company Expal Systems."
"Operating free cash flow – Operating free cash flow of Weapon and Ammunition rose by a significant €623 million 
year-on-year to €463 million."
"The improvement with more than €500 million resulted from a more positive 
development in operating working capital as compared to the previous year."
"Higher incoming payments and 
advance payments from customers more than compensated for the effects from the increase in inventories and 
the higher capital expenditure on capacity expansion."
"Employees –Weapon and Ammunition employed a total of 6,626 people as of the end of the fiscal year."
"This 
equates to an increase in the workforce of 1,923 Personen compared with the previous year and reflects sales 
growth."
"As a result of the acquisition of the Spanish ammunition manufacturer Expal, 1,196 new employees joined 
the division as of August 1, 2023."
"The additional increase of 699 employees goes hand in hand with the growth in 
sales."
"The figure for the previous year 
was also adjusted accordingly."
"Sales –Electronic Solutions generated sales of €1,318 million in fiscal 2023, exceeding the previous year’s figure 
of €1,164 million by 13%."
"Adjusted for currency effects, sales growth was 14%."
"The Air Defence & Radar Systems 
business unit made a significant contribution to this growth with sales from a major order placed in fiscal 2022 
for the delivery of Skynex air defence systems for a European customer."
"Rheinmetall Nomination – The Rheinmetall Nomination for Electronic Solutions climbed to a record €2,183 million 
in fiscal 2023 (previous year: €1,724 million)."
"The biggest individual orders in this division were two major orders 
for Skynex air defence systems for two European customer worth approximately €700 million and the specific 
share of Electronic Solutions in the major orders for the first and second lots of Puma infantry fighting vehicles."
"This good order intake was also thanks to the follow-up order of a drone system (unmanned medium-range 
reconnaissance system) by the German armed forces."
"Rheinmetall Backlog – The Rheinmetall Backlog of Electronic Solutions amounted to €4,287 million at the end of 
fiscal 2023, compared with €3,539 million in the previous year."
"The order backlog thus increased by €749 million 
or around 21.2% year-on-year."
"Significant order backlogs are attributable to the delivery of Skynex air defence 
systems for two European customers and to the Electronic Solutions division’s share of the major Hungarian order 
for the new Lynx infantry fighting vehicle and of the orders for the first and second Puma lots."
"Other significant 
order backlogs are attributable to the orders for unmanned drone systems from the German armed forces."
"Operating result – The operating result in the Electronic Solutions division increased by 23.7% to €150 million as 
a result of the higher sales volume and improved productivity and capacity utilization."
"The operating margin 
increased from 10.4% to 11.4% thanks to successfully completing major orders."
"Operating free cash flow – Operating free cash flow of Electronic Solutions amounted to €11 million, up €7 million 
on the previous year’s figure of €4 million."
"Some major customer payments were delayed until a few days after the 
end of 2023."
"Employees –Electronic Solutions employed 4,155 people as of the end of the fiscal year (previous year: 3,834)."
"This corresponds to an increase of around 321 persons compared with the previous year, which is mainly due to 
the necessary increase in personnel for the future handling of the major projects acquired."
"Adjusted for currency effects, the increase in sales was 4% (+€57 million) and thus lower than global growth 
in light vehicle production, which is estimated at +9% (IHS Markit)."
"This difference is attributable to the fact that 
IHS only partly reflects the relevant market for Sensors and Actuators and does not consider the truck market or 
industrial applications, for example."
"The Air Management product area of Sensors and Actuators increased its sales significantly by 9% compared to 
the previous year."
"This was chiefly due to sales of electric gas pumps on the Chinese and North American market 
as well as sales of exhaust gas recirculation systems and exhaust flaps for both the light and the heavy-duty 
segment."
"The Thermal Management business unit recorded a 2% decline in sales due to lower sales volumes of 
variable oil pumps and electric vacuum pumps."
"In the Electrification & Digitalization area, sales increased 
particularly due to the oil and water valves allocated here, whereas a decline was recorded for the electrical 
switching valve and electro-pneumatic transducer product groups."
"In regional terms, the development of sales varied considerably between the different sales markets."
"While the 
North American market (-1%) and the Asian market (-3%) closed fiscal 2023 down slightly on the previous year’s 
level, an increase was achieved in Europe (+5%)."
"Booked business – Booked business of Sensors and Actuators in fiscal 2023 came to €2,720 million, ‑2% lower 
than a year earlier (previous year: €2,770 million)."
"In fiscal 2023, 49% (previous year 30%) of this was attributable 
to the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) category, 11% (previous year 31%) to Industrial Technology, 13% (previous 
year 21%) to Truck and 27% (previous year 18%) to Electrification."
"In this context, orders for high-voltage water 
pumps in electric vehicles were also acquired in 2023."
"Several orders were acquired for fuel cell applications in 
the passenger car sector and for water pumps in the industrial technology sector."
"Nominated backlog – The nominated backlog in the Sensors and Actuators division in fiscal 2023 came to 
€8,093 million, 9% higher than a year earlier (previous year: €7,453 million)."
Operating result – Sensors and Actuators achieved an operating result of €69 million in fiscal 2023.
"This puts the 
operating result €‑26 million down on the previous year."
"The operating margin declined by 2.1 percentage points 
in 2023 to 4.8%."
"High inflation caused by increased commodities and energy prices resulted in significant procurement price hikes 
for materials."
These cost increases were offset by higher sales prices at customers.
"The sharp increases in staff 
costs due to inflation had a lasting negative impact on earnings."
"As in the previous year, depreciation and 
amortization was reduced further."
"Business recovery costs were also incurred following the attack on IT systems 
in April 2023."
"Operating free cash flow – Operating free cash flow of Sensors and Actuators was down year-on-year at 
€29 million (previous year: €47 million)."
"This decrease in cash flow was mainly due to lower earnings and higher 
capital expenditure."
"In addition, working capital was higher than in the previous year."
"Inventories were up year-
on-year due to higher procurement prices and increased inventory levels to safeguard production against supplier 
insolvencies and to ensure long-term delivery capacity."
"The number of employees decreased both in the indirect areas and in the direct 
workforce."
"Particularly at the American and European locations, staff levels were reduced in line with the changed 
requirements."
"Despite this IT incident, sales declined 
by only ‑1% or €‑4 million year-on-year to €737 million."
"Adjusted for currency effects, there was a decline in sales 
of ‑1%."
"The Trade business unit again showed a very good year-on-year sales performance despite the cyberattack, 
with sales growth of 4% or €18 million."
"Higher sales were generated in the Trade unit particularly in the sales 
regions of Europe, South America and Asia."
"In the Bearings business unit, sales declined by 8% or €24 million 
year-on-year."
"In the Continuous Castings unit, the passing on of lower material prices, significantly reduced 
tonnage – particularly due to a weak market in the construction and sanitation industry – and a change in the 
sales mix together led to a year-on-year decrease in sales."
"In business with plain bearings, by contrast, there was 
a slight volume-driven increase in sales compared to the previous year."
"Booked business – Booked business of Materials and Trade came to €760 million in fiscal 2023, representing a 
slight year-on-year increase of 1%."
"In fiscal 2023, 69% (previous year 73%) of this was attributable to the Internal 
Combustion Engine (ICE) category, 26% (previous year 25%) to Industrial Technology, 3% (previous year 1%) to 
Electrification and 2% (previous year 0%) to Truck."
Nominated backlog – The nominated backlog of Materials and Trade amounted to €288 million in fiscal 2023.
"Compared to the previous year, the nominated backlog of Materials and Trade decreased due to the 
reclassification of previous orders and framework contracts as individual transactions, which by definition are not 
reported in the nominated backlog."
"Operating result –Materials and Trade generated an operating result at the previous year’s level at €66 million in 
fiscal 2023."
The operating margin of 8.9% is on a par with the previous year’s level.
The Trade business unit achieved a significant improvement in earnings.
"This was chiefly due to the higher sales 
achieved and the lack of the previous year’s negative earnings contribution from Amprio GmbH."
"In the Bearings 
business unit, the operating result was down significantly year-on-year."
"This was attributable to the decline in 
sales in the Continuous Castings unit and the negative impact from rising energy prices and negative currency 
effects."
"Earnings from the Castings business unit, which are largely determined by the at-equity contribution of 
the joint venture HASCO KSPG Nonferrous Components (Shanghai) Co."
"Ltd, were slightly higher in fiscal 2023 than 
a year earlier, despite a weak development of the Chinese market for vehicles with combustion engines during the 
year."
"Operating free cash flow – Operating free cash flow of Materials and Trade decreased year-on-year to €23 million 
(previous year: €37 million)."
"The decline compared to the previous year was mainly due to lower earnings after 
taxes and higher working capital."
"The percentage increase in employees came to 1.2%, while sales declined 
by -1%."
"Despite the sale of the operating business of Amprio GmbH, the number of employees increased at the 
German locations in particular, but also in Brazil, China and India."
"By contrast, the number of employees at the 
companies in Italy and the Czech Republic decreased slightly."
Rheinmetall AG’s role as a holding company for the Rheinmetall Group shapes its financial statements.
"In this 
role, Rheinmetall AG performs control and governance functions and provides services to the Group companies."
"Key tasks relating to the financial statements include central financing as well as support and service functions in 
finances, HR, corporate communications, law, and taxation."
"Results of operations 
Rheinmetall AG’s results of operations reflect its function as a holding company."
"The results of the subsidiaries 
and the expenses and income from central Group financing determine the financial result."
"In addition, earnings 
before taxes are influenced by income from the provision of support and service functions and profit and loss from 
central currency management."
"Tax costs are defined by Rheinmetall AG’s role as the fiscal entity for income tax 
purposes in Germany."
"The rise in net investment income results primarily from the business performance of the 
Rheinmetall Group companies operating in the security technology sector."
Net interest income deteriorated from €3 million to €-18 million.
"The deterioration in net interest income resulted 
primarily from the issue of a convertible bond in two tranches of €500 million each (interest costs €36 million 
previous year: €0 million)."
"The convertible bond was used to finance the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U., 
Madrid/Spain."
"As a result of the influences outlined, Rheinmetall AG’s financial result improved from €306 million 
to €549 million."
Sales fell due to lower allocations of €126 million in fiscal year 2023 to €84 million in the year under review.
"Due 
to business as a holding company, personnel costs amounted to €63 million (previous year: €66 million)."
"The 
primary factor behind the decline was the transfer of employees to Rheinmetall IT Solutions GmbH as of 
May 1, 2022."
Other operating income increased by €55 million to €221 million.
"Higher IT costs passed on to Group 
companies were a major factor here."
"Compared with the previous year, this was driven in particular by the services provided by 
Rheinmetall IT Solutions GmbH for the Rheinmetall Group."
"The amortization, depreciation and write-downs in 2023 
include write-downs on securities held in circulation amounting to €3 million (previous year: €28 million)."
"Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are unchanged at €5 million."
Earnings before taxes amounted to €491 million (previous year: €252 million).
"Following deduction of €99 million 
in taxes (previous year: €59 million), net income of €393 million remained for fiscal year 2023 (previous year: 
€193 million)."
"As a result, net income significantly exceeded the expected range of €190 million to €240 million."
"A total of €143 million (previous year: €3 million) of the net income was transferred to retained earnings, resulting 
in net earnings of €250 million (previous year: €190 million)."
"Net assets and financial position 
The asset situation of Rheinmetall AG is largely defined by its holding function, i.e."
"by the management of 
investments and the financing of Group activities."
"This is reflected above all in the amount of the investments held 
and in the receivables due from and liabilities owed to Group companies."
acquired in the previous year.
"From the increase of €1,289 million, 
a total of €1,213 million relates to the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"The share of financial assets in total 
assets subsequently increased from 42% to 55%."
"Receivables and other assets of €1,605 million (previous year: €1,662 million) mainly comprise receivables from 
affiliated companies."
"These originate almost exclusively from intra-Group financing and central liquidity 
management."
The share of these receivables in total assets amounted to 30% (previous year: 42%).
"The securities portfolio in the previous year related to the shares in a special fund acquired at the end of 2021 as 
a strategic liquidity reserve."
These were disposed of in full in 2023.
"Cash and cash equivalents rose from 
€428 million in the previous year to €664 million."
"This change reflected the fact that the dividend payment for 2022 of €143 million was offset by the 
net income of €393 million generated in 2023."
"In addition, equity increased by €88 million due to the convertible 
bond issue."
"Due to the increase in total assets, the equity ratio fell to 28% (previous year: 30%)."
Provisions include pension provisions of €38 million (previous year €34 million).
"Measured pension obligations 
of €130 million (previous year: €128 million) are covered by plan assets of €92 million (previous year: 
€95 million)."
"Other liabilities include liabilities to affiliated companies of €1,973 million (previous year: €1,946 million)."
"These 
originate almost exclusively from intra-Group financing and central liquidity management."
"The share of these 
liabilities in total assets declined from 49% to 37%."
"As an internationally active technology group with a 
heterogeneous product portfolio, Rheinmetall is exposed to risks that vary depending on the business unit, 
industry and region."
"The corporate policy is aimed at generating fair returns over the long term, looking at any 
opportunities that come our way, leveraging and expanding success potential, and avoiding, minimizing or 
compensating for the associated risks."
"The aim is to maintain our corporate flexibility and financial security, 
enhance the company’s value and, in turn, safeguard the continued, long-term existence of the Rheinmetall Group."
"The standardized risk management system (RMS) that was introduced throughout the Group is based on principles 
stipulated by the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG, which are geared toward financial resources and strategic 
and operational planning."
"At the Rheinmetall Group, identified opportunities are considered in terms of their 
impact on the planned earnings indicators within the framework of existing planning, controlling and strategy 
processes and assessed and documented in processes that run separately from the risk management system."
"The 
Rheinmetall Group’s risk management system is designed to systematically identify developments early on that 
could jeopardize the continued existence of the Group and to control risks that could endanger the company’s 
success."
It also helps to ensure that the corporate targets can be met.
"It comprises the ad hoc, operational and strategic risk management pillars and 
pursues the “three lines of defence” approach."
"Three lines of defence model 
    
The first line of defence lies with the management of the operating activities, which is responsible for recording, 
assessing and managing the risks that arise there."
"The second line of defence comprises the risk management, 
the compliance management and the internal control system."
"Internal Audit is the third line of defence and acts 
as the independent control organ of the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG."
"This means that established countermeasures and checks are taken into 
account in the evaluation of the potential extent of loss."
"This results in an aggregated assessment of the risk types 
and risk fields as well as an evaluated risk portfolio of the Rheinmetall Group."
"All information used in the 
assessment and aggregation of risk types and fields is documented as part of strategic risk management in special 
risk management software."
"Ad hoc risks that are assessed as having a “medium” loss extent and a “probable” probability of occurrence can 
generally be identified by any employee during the year between the operational and strategic risk management 
reporting cycles and communicated as part of a defined process."
"If it is not possible to immediately control the ad 
hoc risk, it can be taken into account as part of operational and, if necessary, strategic risk management."
"In the analysis and assessment of individual risks in terms of the extent of loss, which must be performed 
quarterly, operational risk management focuses exclusively on the “performance” risk dimension."
"The thresholds 
for reporting these individual risks are a potential extent of loss of more than a €5 million impact on EBIT and a 
probability of occurrence of more than 30%."
"The period under review relates to the ongoing fiscal year and the two 
following years."
"The divisions prepare operational risk reports for the central Corporate Controlling and Risk Management 
department every quarter, while the operational risk situation is reported every month within the divisions."
"Any 
relevant individual issues and important, higher-level incidents/issues are discussed in the committee meetings 
at the level of the divisions and Rheinmetall Group as a whole."
"If necessary, individual risks from operational risk management can be outlined in the strategic risk management 
reports as examples and/or for illustrative purposes."
"To identify, analyze and assess potential risks – including 
the addition of new risks – the previous year’s risk inventory is updated once a year as part of strategic risk 
management."
"This contains all the most important risk types potentially impacting the corporate targets and sub-
targets, probabilities of occurrence, the potential level of loss, responsibilities and suitable countermeasures."
"The 
extent of loss, which is considered over a period of three years, is evaluated according to a range of quantitative 
and qualitative parameters."
"The risk dimensions Performance, Market | Customer | Reputation and Legal are used 
as a basis here, although not every risk can necessarily be assigned to all three dimensions."
"Measures aimed at controlling the risks that were identified 
and evaluated over a three-year period must be formulated and their implementation systematically monitored."
"On this basis, formal reporting takes place to the Executive Board and the heads of the divisions (including in their 
capacities as heads of the relevant legal entities)."
"This risk reporting is based on bundled information on risk 
types, risk fields and the corresponding countermeasures and, in contrast to ad hoc and operational risk 
management, not explicitly on individual risks."
"Reporting from the various entities is concluded with the review of 
the risk portfolio by the risk managers and the subsequent release by the relevant CFO."
"Suitable preventive, 
validation and corrective actions lower the probability of risks occurring or limit the extent of loss."
"The risk 
management measures introduced are monitored on an ongoing basis and, where necessary, adjusted in line with 
a new risk assessment."
"In particular, it combines the sub-functions of corporate governance, the internal 
control system (ICS), the risk management system (RMS), the compliance management system (CMS) and internal 
auditing."
"The Committee meets at least once a quarter, discusses and reviews the current risk portfolio and the 
status of risk management measures."
"If necessary, additional measures are taken in order to 
further limit and reduce identified potential risks."
"Sudden or unexpected risks with significant consequences are 
reported to the Executive Board on an ad hoc basis."
"The Supervisory Board is advised of individual operational 
risks in the quarterly reports that entail a net loss exceeding €5 million of EBIT and also have a probability of 
occurrence of 30% or more."
"The thresholds for reporting risks to the Supervisory Board on an ad hoc basis are a 
net loss of more than €20 million of EBIT and a probability of occurrence of more than 50%."
"By contrast, risks with 
a potential loss below €2 million and/or that have a probability of occurrence of less than 2% are not reported."
"In order to calculate the risk-bearing capacity in accordance with IDW PS 340 (01.2022)(as amended), a Monte 
Carlo simulation was performed in 2023 to determine the overall risk situation of the Rheinmetall Group."
"IDW PS 
340 (as amended) defines risk-bearing capacity as the maximum risk that the Rheinmetall Group can bear over 
time without seriously jeopardizing its existence."
"We compare the resulting aggregated risk situation with the thresholds defined by the 
Executive Board for critical key figures."
"Risks are classified as 
material individual risks when they have at least a medium extent of loss and at least a possible probability of 
occurrence."
"We maintain close customer relations and, 
even as early as the offer phase, endeavor to address the needs and requirements of our customers to the greatest 
possible extent."
"Thanks to technical innovation and the ever-expanding breadth of our product portfolio, we can 
use our various sales channels to position further products with customers."
"Opportunities also arise through our 
generally long-term business relations and our global presence."
"At irregular intervals, we conduct customer 
satisfaction analyses so that we can identify and implement improvement potential."
"Customer risks could arise from the dependency on key buyers, who use their negotiating power and increase 
pressure on margins."
This can apply particularly to OEMs of Sensors and Actuators and Materials and Trade.
"The 
transformation of the automotive industry also poses a risk."
"As part of the energy transition, the shift in the vehicle 
drive mix toward electromobility has also advanced."
"Declines in demand or the loss of these customers can 
negatively impact the Rheinmetall Group’s business and performance."
"When competition is particularly intense, 
it might also be the case that we can no longer assert our target margins in order negotiations."
"The key customers of Vehicle Systems, Weapon and Ammunition, and Electronic Solutions are national and 
international authorities."
"Risks lie in the dependence on spending patterns for public budgets in Germany and 
foreign customer nations."
"In general, this can lead to shifts and cuts in state budgets, which can also affect 
defence."
"Risks also arise from increasing 
transatlantic competition."
"Moreover, there is tough international competition on export markets to which the 
Group has access."
"With reference to the €100 billion special fund made available by the German government for the German armed 
forces to strengthen national and alliance defence and the shift triggered by the Ukraine war, there are still 
opportunities to realize previously unfunded major projects."
"The Federal Armed Forces Procurement Acceleration 
Act (Bundeswehrbeschaffungsbeschleunigungsgesetz) also provides opportunities to conclude contracts more 
quickly through simplified award procedures."
"The increased order intake to be expected as a result may be offset 
by temporary capacity or staff bottlenecks."
"When new business areas are opened up, misjudgments regarding customer requirements, resource deployment, 
price/margin targets as well as demand, market and competition developments are also possible."
"Through 
structured analyses and processes with defined milestones from the idea to the commercialization of new 
business fields, Rheinmetall strives to minimize any associated risks."
"The development of the Rheinmetall Group is closely linked with macroeconomic trends and drivers as well as 
economic cycles on a global level but also in the individual regions and countries in which we operate."
"It is not 
possible to completely avoid risks that arise due to economic cycles."
"A deterioration in statutory, regulatory and/or 
general economic conditions in the sales regions can adversely impact the sales and earnings situation of the 
Rheinmetall Group."
"Geopolitical or economic crises can affect overall global demand, regional markets or 
individual industries."
"The consistent alignment of business towards the major economic areas in Europe, the US 
and Asia reduces dependence on individual customer countries, thereby distributing the risk."
"The diversified 
product portfolio of the divisions and consistent internationalization of the Rheinmetall Group help to ensure that 
temporary economic fluctuations can be offset in part by more favorable developments in other regions and 
markets."
"In times of advancing globalization and growing competition and market transparency, market risks are becoming 
more prevalent."
"Trends such as digitalization, artificial intelligence and the electrification of vehicles require 
disruptive technologies and business models and lead to new customer requirements that were not anticipated 
or to which the response was inadequate."
"Global challenges relating to climate change, pandemic events, 
interstate conflicts, migration and resource scarcity can trigger changes in customer behavior."
"This can lead to 
changes in the portfolio and to fluctuations in prices, quantities and margins."
"In 
view of the technological progress in our industries as well as the transformation of our former automotive 
business into a long-term resilient and innovative civilian business, we continue to strive to develop new markets 
and customer groups in the civilian industries and security segments."
"Thanks to our broad international presence, 
we can respond to market and demand fluctuations and balance out developments in individual regions and 
industries."
"Competition 
Rheinmetall’s risk profile can also be negatively impacted by changes in the competition structure."
"Consolidation 
trends force competitors to merge, and new competitors can emerge through technological innovations."
"In their 
industry and security policies, some countries strive to create highly skilled workforces and a high degree of 
autonomy from imports."
"For us, this means building up our own capacities by increasing the percentage of local 
value added."
"Furthermore, where competition is fierce, we cannot rule out the possibility of being unable to 
achieve our margin targets."
"By systematically monitoring the competitive environment, Rheinmetall is in a position 
to respond to these changes early on."
"International partnerships and systematic localization concepts are part of 
the Group’s strategy and, together with technological market entry barriers, serve to safeguard business."
"Technology and development 
Our innovative strength is a key success factor, which we consider to be a driver of profitable growth."
"The sometimes long development lead times, continuously changing regulatory and 
technological framework conditions and intense competition are key factors contributing to the uncertainty 
regarding the economic success of current or future products."
"In particular, the changes in the global security 
environment pose new challenges for Germany, the EU, NATO and NATO-equivalent states."
"The current complex 
security threats necessitate a systematic realignment of security and defence policy for the next decade and 
beyond."
The turning point declared by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reflects these new security threats.
"In this dynamic environment, the Rheinmetall Group is a reliable partner that takes on responsibility and helps 
provide security by developing and expanding capacity in the short term, particularly in the area of research and 
development."
"However, the successful, targeted and sustainable development of capacity will depend on 
consistent long-term continuation of the course taken by the politicians."
"Only then can the planning security 
required for the process be established on a lasting basis."
"This particularly applies to the commitment to NATO’s 
2% target."
"The possibility of political reassessments of the priorities represents a potential risk to this 
development."
"In addition, Rheinmetall continuously analyzes the technological developments that emerge particularly in 
connection with the Ukraine war but also in other conflicts worldwide in order to identify potential capability gaps 
and eliminate these by way of targeted technological innovations."
"The fast pace of the developments observed 
also poses a challenge and necessitates rapid, targeted decisions."
"In addition to external factors and observations, the Rheinmetall Group invests in research, development and 
innovation to develop new, disruptive technologies and make them ready for use so as to ensure its own 
technological edge in the future, too."
"To this end, Rheinmetall also leverages synergies between the defence sector 
and the civilian sector in a targeted way in order to benefit from new ideas, innovative approaches, and fast civilian 
innovation cycles."
The transformation of the automotive industry regarding alternative drive systems is leading to new challenges.
Global climate change in particular is encouraging a change in vehicle drives.
"As a result of the generally increased share of electronics in these aggregates, this trend 
brings with it the opportunity of increasing the share of value added."
"Parallel to this transformation for drives, it is 
particularly digitalization in vehicles which offers an opportunity to bring new products and product functionalities 
to the market."
"On the other hand, this trend also harbors the risk that moving into digital technology and product 
segments requires high expenditure in establishing expertise for development and production."
"Furthermore, it 
should also be taken into account that products with a high share of digitalization generally have shorter product 
life cycles, which ultimately can result in high expenditure for adjustments, and thus amortization risks."
"Thanks to a balanced mix of short-, medium- and long-term projects in a well-filled research and development 
pipeline, we are making advances in new markets and technological fields and, in doing so, further safeguarding 
our technology positions."
"Further information on research and development activities can be found under »Basic 
information on the Rheinmetall Group – research and development."
"Rheinmetall’s focus on developing new technologies and innovations outside the existing core business and 
bringing them to market maturity quickly is particularly on the technology segments of automation, new sensor 
technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and new mobility."
"The latter is particularly supported by targeted activities 
in the area of electromobility and hydrogen technologies."
"Further details are presented in the »Research and 
development chapter."
"Despite compliance with the processes and the use of state-of-the-art project management, monitoring and 
controlling measures, developing new products and launching new technologies and products entail risks in 
addition to changes to existing product portfolios."
"These exist not only in the actual design and development 
phase, but also during market launch, where startup costs may be higher than expected or unscheduled delays 
may arise."
"Risks can also arise following market launch due to the potential need for technical improvements, 
which come to light only following use in real-life situations or through continuous operation."
"Production and project implementation 
Rheinmetall counters potential production risks by applying high technical, safety and process standards at its 
plants in line with the relevant risks."
"We ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for the product areas 
through internal policies and procedural instructions as well as by establishing, applying and continuously 
improving management systems."
"Our quality management systems have been certified in accordance with the 
internationally recognized ISO 9001, IATF 16949 and AQAP or EN 9100 standards for many years now, for example."
"In addition, methods including Six Sigma, lean management and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) are 
used to prevent quality risks."
"Appropriate insurance cover is in place for warranty, product liability and recall risks, 
which is reviewed periodically and adjusted where necessary."
"Wherever possible, the management systems are 
run as integrated management systems, meaning that the issue of quality is linked with other issues such as the 
environment, health and safety, and energy."
"Risks may arise from capacity bottlenecks due to staff shortages, technical disruptions, excessive scrap levels, 
lack of demand availability as a result of failures or partial failures in the supply chains, or excessive reliance on 
individual production sites."
"Continuous 
improvement in production – for example, by simplifying processes or increasing the level of automation – helps 
to further increase production efficiency."
"The availability of production plants is ensured through preventive 
maintenance with accompanying checks and through investments and modernizations."
"Production may also be impacted by factors such as natural disasters, disruptions in the infrastructure, delivery 
stops or technical failure."
"As a countermeasure, Rheinmetall operates appropriate business continuity 
management (BCM)."
Rheinmetall reviews investment decisions carefully over several stages.
"Investments that exceed a defined limit 
are presented to the Executive Board for approval after undergoing a review."
"Nevertheless, unforeseen changes in 
general conditions can lead to higher investment costs or cause delays to facilities being commissioned."
"Risks may also arise from the handling of projects in terms of planning, calculation and execution."
"This is due to 
the scope of major projects, their long terms lasting several years and their complexity, particularly at Vehicle 
Systems, Weapon and Ammunition and Electronic Solutions."
"These risks include not only uncertainty in 
calculations, but also unexpected technical and/or logistical problems, difficulties surrounding the fulfillment of 
product specifications, underestimations of the level of complexity (e.g."
"in technical implementation), project-
specific additions and related cost increases, capacity and supply bottlenecks as well as quality problems with 
business partners or suppliers, unforeseeable developments during assembly and deferred dates of acceptance 
and settlement."
"Suppliers and procurement 
The purchasing organization is controlled by the Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO)."
"It is managed via a matrix 
structure, with the procurement units in the divisions reporting to the CPO in functional terms while there are also 
central units in Procurement, such as Governance, ESG and Commodity Management, that cooperate with the 
divisions."
One key element for managing this area is the Rheinmetall Group Purchasing Council (RGP Council).
"All 
divisions are represented on the RGP Council in order to improve Rheinmetall’s market position with respect to 
suppliers and achieve better purchasing conditions."
"This ranges from optimized prices to improved payment and 
delivery conditions."
"Another objective of the RGP Council is to transfer expertise and information and to ensure 
networking within the purchasing organization."
"Furthermore, regular exchanges in the RGP Council ensure that the 
purchasing organization is adapted to changing requirements and that both organization and processes are 
described in sufficient detail."
"Risks can arise in connection with the purchasing of raw materials, parts and components in the form of 
unexpected supply shortages, delays or bottlenecks in delivery, quality problems or rising purchase prices for 
intermediate products, raw materials and energy."
"This is countered through ongoing monitoring of the 
procurement markets, structured procurement concepts and the avoidance of dependence on individual 
suppliers."
"Ongoing optimization of our 
supplier circle can leader to more favorable purchasing conditions."
"If new suppliers possessing, for example, 
specialized innovative product knowledge are identified, our competitive situation may improve."
"Legal bans on 
substances and/or materials are taken into account through appropriate measures and cooperation with other 
specialist areas."
"Price risks for raw 
materials, particularly aluminum, copper and nickel, are countered with cost escalation clauses in contracts on 
the sales side."
"When procuring raw materials that are traded on the stock market, the central Commodities Office 
manages the timing of purchases and the volume purchased in consultation with the operating units, making use 
of financial hedging instruments."
"An inadequate energy supply for the Rheinmetall companies under cost-efficient conditions constitutes a risk for 
competitive production at the sites."
"Electricity and gas purchases in the Rheinmetall Group are made in advance 
on a rolling basis over several years based on the medium-term planning."
"It is not possible to ensure complete 
hedging of fluctuations in the price of energy sources or to guarantee that increases in energy prices will be passed 
on to customers."
"However, we hold talks with our customers to make the development on the energy markets 
transparent and also to establish corresponding safeguard clauses."
"Rising energy costs are addressed by bundling 
procurement volumes and through coordinated invitations to tender, long contract durations and optimization of 
the energy price via the European Energy Exchange in Leipzig."
"Germany’s energy turnaround is expected to lead to 
the expansion of electricity grids and a significant increase in the share of renewable energies."
"We believe that 
constantly rising electricity prices represent a risk – a development that could impact the international 
competitiveness of industrial companies."
"We have responded to this partly by investing in renewable energy 
generation ourselves now."
Crises such as geopolitical tensions or natural disasters pose a fundamental risk to supply chains.
"We counter 
these by increasingly endeavoring to ensure transparency in the supply chain and making risk-minimized 
decisions on the basis of these insights."
"Furthermore, a cross-disciplinary team was already set up in the previous 
year to respond quickly to changes in the situation and to prevent potential losses and damages due to disruptions 
in the supply chain."
"In addition to general risks in our international procurement activities, country- and supplier-specific risks may 
also arise."
"This includes, for example, child labor, the conscious acceptance of environmental damage, or 
inadequate safety and working conditions."
"As part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), such risks are ruled 
out with business partner reviews."
"In 2023, we introduced a system for analyzing human rights and environmental 
risks in our supply chain."
"This system forms the basis for the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due 
Diligence Act at suppliers ."
"The conflict in Eastern Europe means additional 
risks in relation to the security of existing supply chains."
"Furthermore, global supply problems in the 
semiconductor market are ongoing."
These can impact both procurement and sales.
"This is being counteracted 
with interdisciplinary teams, the use of alternative and sound requirement forecasts."
"Rheinmetall is also exposed 
to logistics risks."
"These manifest themselves as capacity fluctuations, non-compliance with transport lead times 
and even interruptions in the transport of goods for all modes of transport."
"These can have an impact on both 
transport costs and material availability."
"Having a high turnover of managers and employees in key positions can 
lead to a loss of key specialist knowledge and expertise."
"We mitigate potential personnel risks, for example, by positioning Rheinmetall globally as a fair and attractive 
employer with a value-based corporate culture and by using target group-oriented personnel marketing to 
communicate our strengths to the outside world, in particular to younger people."
"As an international company, we also pursue a diversity-oriented HR policy."
"The success of 
these measures is reflected in the high number of applications from qualified people, the low fluctuation over the 
past few years and a relatively long average tenure within the company."
"Furthermore, we offer a variety of flexible 
working time arrangements at our German sites and the option of working from home on a temporary basis, which 
are designed to promote a healthy work-life balance."
"We counteract the demographic change in particular through funding suitable programs for young 
people, knowledge management and occupational health management organized on a Group-wide basis."
The companies of Rheinmetall AG face intense competition in attracting qualified employees.
"Our growth driven 
by innovation and the transformation of civilian business are changing the requirements for the available expertise 
in research and development as well as production."
"Our companies are already discovering that it is becoming 
more difficult to attract engineers with specialist knowledge in the fields of software and electrical engineering 
throughout the world."
"Generally, this situation will get worse as the pressure to innovate in the industry as a whole 
will increase."
"Capacity adjustments, potential efficiency enhancement measures and possible restructuring or reorganization 
that may be necessary to safeguard long-term competitiveness often require a reconciliation of interests at 
operating level."
"We endeavor to limit the negative impact of such measures on the workforce wherever possible 
and to make any job cuts that may become necessary in a socially responsible manner."
"We traditionally work 
constructively with employee representatives at our sites."
"Finances 
Rheinmetall’s business situation, financial position and performance are exposed to financial risks from operating 
activities."
"The main financial risks are liquidity risks, counterparty risks and market price risks arising from 
changes in interest rates, exchange rates or raw material prices."
"Liquidity risk is the risk that existing or future payment obligations cannot be met, cannot be met on time or can 
be met only with excessive costs."
"To manage this risk, all cash transactions are recorded, assessed and centrally 
aggregated within the scope of corporate planning and rolling monthly twelve-month liquidity plans."
"The values 
calculated are compared with the available financial scope to identify any potential financing gaps early on."
"Scenarios such as catastrophe-related sales slumps and payment defaults, unexpected working capital 
requirements or reductions in credit facilities are simulated, taking into account worst-case scenarios."
"When 
determining the necessary financial scope, Rheinmetall takes great care to ensure that adequate reserves are held 
at all times."
"Counterparty risks arise in connection with deposits, financing commitments or financial receivables such as 
positive fair values from hedging transactions, as a result of the relevant counterparty’s inability to pay or 
insolvency."
"Rheinmetall manages these risks through limit-based, creditworthiness-linked and widely diversified 
lending from commercial banks."
"Financial transactions are conducted exclusively with banking or insurance 
partners that have an investment grade rating from recognized rating agencies or comparable credit ratings."
"Moreover, in the allocation of business, emphasis is placed on ensuring that, in addition to sufficient 
diversification of the counterparties themselves, diversification is pursued at country level as well."
Default risks from the operating business can generally be assessed as low on account of the customer structure.
"In the case of large-volume or long-term business relations, potential counterparty risks are individually analyzed 
and managed by means of prepayments, milestone payments, guarantees, letters of credit or credit default swaps 
and special individual contractual frameworks."
"There are no customer or country dependencies that could 
jeopardize the continued existence of the Rheinmetall Group if they were to take a negative turn."

Interest rate risks arise from volatility on the money and capital markets."
These can occur in two forms.
"Whereas 
fixed-interest financial instruments can result in fluctuations in fair values and thus to valuation effects that are of 
relevance to earnings, variable-interest financial instruments are subject to a cash flow risk, as future interest 
payments can fluctuate in terms of their amount."
"Currency risks that Rheinmetall is exposed to in its global business operations can also have an adverse effect on 
the operating result."
"Here, too, the Group’s risk management unit should be involved early on in large-volume 
projects or long-term contract negotiations to prevent currency risks from occurring at all by formulating contract 
currencies or introducing cost escalation clauses."
"Moreover, in currency management, simulation calculations are 
performed to derive hedging strategies and use suitable derivatives that reflect the different business structures 
of the divisions."
The currency risks are identified and assessed as part of regular reporting.
"Similar to hedging against interest rate and currency risks, risks from changes in prices are largely avoided in 
advance in contract negotiations for the procurement of raw materials or significantly restricted through the 
agreement of cost escalation clauses."
"In cases where this is not possible, derivative financial instruments are 
used."
"This is the case, for example, for industrial metals and the energy sector."
"The strategic management of 
market price risks is carried out at regular financial committee meetings, in which the hedging decisions are made 
and documented."
Regulatory or political interventions can impact the processing of international payment transactions.
"This would 
mean that either Rheinmetall would not fulfill its contractual payment obligations or would fulfill them only to a 
limited extent, or it itself would receive cash receipts from exports incomplete or late."
"On the whole, this risk 
should be classified as insignificant for Rheinmetall and would be managed on a case-by-case basis if it should 
ever occur."
"Taxes 
Tax risks can result from changes in the legal or tax structure of the Rheinmetall Group or from assessment periods 
that are still open."
"The differing assessment of circumstances during audits can lead to claims on the part of the 
tax authorities."
"There is also a risk that the tax burden for the Rheinmetall Group may increase as a result of 
changes to tax legislation for individual countries or court decisions."
"To identify and minimize tax risks at an early stage, the Rheinmetall Group has set up a global tax compliance 
management system and taken organizational measures aimed at ensuring compliance with tax legislation."
"This 
system is developed on a regular and systematic basis."
"Legal 
Legal risks can arise in relation to competitors, business partners or customers and as a result of changes to the 
legal framework in the relevant markets."
"Not only is the Group supported by detailed advice from its own specialist 
legal experts, but it also, depending on the case, consults external experts."
"Furthermore, potential losses, damage 
and liability resulting from ordinary operations are, wherever possible, appropriately covered by insurance policies 
or corresponding accounting provisions."
Our goal is to avoid litigation within the limits of what is economically reasonable.
"However, it is naturally difficult 
to predict the outcome of pending legal and administrative proceedings in the majority of cases."
"Costs can arise 
on the basis of adverse court or official decisions or the conclusion of settlements that are not covered or not fully 
covered by provisions or insurance policies and thus exceed the provisions that have been made."
"However, after 
a thorough review, we do not believe this will occur."
"Regulatory and legislative changes at national or European level may involve risks that could negatively affect our 
earnings situation."
"This applies, for example, to new laws and other amended legal frameworks (e.g."
"relating to 
export controls) or through export restrictions in practice."
"Embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade 
restriction could be imposed on countries in which we operate by the European Union, the US or other countries 
or organizations."
"Furthermore, compliance violations that have a high public profile always pose the risk of significant and lasting 
damage to the company’s reputation."
"Customers, shareholders, employees, non-governmental organizations, 
rating agencies and also the general public could lose trust in our company."
"In itself, the examination and 
clarification of alleged cases can result in considerable internal and external costs."
Compliance risks can occur in every area of the company.
"The compliance organization therefore aims to ensure 
proper and compliant modes of conduct and behavior on the part of a company and its employees and to make 
sure that potential or actual infringements of external or internal regulations are responded to appropriately."
"The regular execution of a Group-wide compliance risk assessment (top-down and bottom-up) and additional 
regular and case-by-case risk analyses help to identify systemic and company-specific compliance risks."
"Measures 
to introduce or improve international or local structures, guidelines, processes, IT systems and training content 
are derived from the results."
"However, despite extensive and multi-level inspection and control mechanisms, the possibility of risks arising 
from unlawful activities of individual parties cannot be ruled out."
Alleged cases are investigated actively.
"In 
investigative proceedings we cooperate with the relevant authorities."
"Proven misconduct results in consequences 
for those involved and – if necessary – to adjustments in the organization."
"However, the financial impact of 
compliance cases on the Group’s results is very difficult to estimate."
"Depending on the case and the 
circumstances, a considerable range is to be assumed."
"The introduction in 2018 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) required EU-based companies also 
to meet a whole range of obligations concerning data protection."
"Violations of the GDPR are subject to significant 
sanctions, including the imposition of fines totaling up to 4% of the Group’s total global sales."
"To counter these 
risks, we established a Group-wide data security management system (DSMS) to ensure a data protection level 
that is structured, secure and, as far as possible, standardized."
"It defines a range of functions and responsibilities 
and undergoes continuous improvement as part of a “plan–do–check–act” cycle."
"The effectiveness of the DSMS 
is monitored on an ongoing basis."
"Where legally prescribed, data protection officers are appointed in Rheinmetall."
Our employees receive regular instruction and training in matters relating to data protection.
"The content of data 
protection training is adapted for individual departments in line with the specific requirements in their respective 
spheres of work."
"For new employees, this training is an important part of the induction process."
"The introduction of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) in 2023 has given rise to new, additional 
due diligence requirements for Rheinmetall that are intended to ensure compliance with specific environmental 
and human rights standards."
"With the help of corresponding risk management systems (for its own business, the 
supply chain and the Social Compliance Officer), Rheinmetall ensures that the LkSG requirements are 
implemented lawfully."
"Public perception 
In a time in which markets are interconnected and the flow of information is becoming increasingly globalized, 
communication is becoming ever more important to the company’s success."
"Shareholders, customers, lenders, 
employees, the media and the public at large are informed regularly, transparently and quickly about our social 
and financial status, our key processes and changes as well as the latest news and developments."
"Protecting and building a positive reputation as a central task of communications is considered 
essential in order to continue to be recognized and commissioned as a supplier and equipment provider to the 
public sector and to be able to survive on the money, credit and capital markets."
"In particular, the impact of our 
communications and other image-building measures on the general (media) public determines how we are 
perceived by politicians, administrators, and business and financial players."
"Environmental, social, governance 
Sustainability risks (non-financial risks) differ in part from traditional risk assessments in terms of the timescale 
considered, the assessment of their impact, but also in perspective."
"For this reason, the process for sustainability 
risk reporting builds on the existing risk management modules, but goes beyond them in parts."
"Potential 
sustainability risks are identified and assessed both at Group level and in the divisions as part of the risk 
management system."
"In addition to the safety of our products, protecting our employees and the environment and respecting and 
safeguarding human rights in our own business activities and in business relationships along the value chain are 
high priorities."
"Misconduct and non-compliance with legal requirements or the Group’s own standards may have 
effects such as personal injury, environmental, property and reputational damage, production downtime and 
interruptions to operations, and the obligation to pay damages."
"This also includes the risk of releasing hazardous 
substances as a result of a failure in production, the obligation to remove contamination, and risks from the area 
of compliance with human rights and from potentially addressing these insufficiently."
"With our principles, 
standards and measures, we ensure that our requirements are communicated appropriately and implemented in 
the best possible way."
"Customers could potentially refuse to 
award contracts to us, private and institutional investors might refuse to include us in their portfolio, and financial 
institutes might refuse to issue loans at all or only at an increased cost."
"MSCI, ISS ESG, Sustainalytics, VigeoEiris, ESG Book, 
CDP and EcoVadis)."
"Furthermore, the passing of legislation or regulations for the finance sector could cause institutional investors to 
restructure their portfolios and reduce or terminate their exposures in companies that operate in industries 
classed as critical."
Possible sector exclusions (e.g.
"for the weapons and defence industry) could also limit our 
options to raise capital."
"Changes to the qualification criteria for being accepted to or remaining on stock indices 
could also harbor risks for our company."
"Business activities that touch on sensitive ESG topics could result in a negative response among stakeholders or 
trigger negative media reports, which could damage our reputation and jeopardize the achievement of our 
business goals."
This impact could potentially be exacerbated by insufficient crisis communication.
"Rheinmetall aims to prevent the 
negative consequences of its business activities and in the supply chain impacting its ability to uphold human 
rights."
"In addition to the direct risk of 
sanctions, violations of our own commitments or of laws or corporate policies also entail strategic and operational 
risks and pose a reputational risk."
"This applies in 
particular to provisions relating to not only the environment, chemicals, hazardous substances and critical raw 
materials, but also occupational and health protection."
"It also includes regulations relating to air, soil and water 
pollution and waste disposal, all of which have recently been made stricter by new legislation, particularly in the 
European Union and the US."
Adapting to new requirements could increase operating costs or require unscheduled investments.
"A whole range 
of different licenses and approvals are also required for our locations and factories and their provisions have to 
be met, which are subject to renewal, amendment, suspension and revocation by the issuing authority."
"We actively counter these risks in various ways, including 
through high technical standards, integrated management systems and certification in accordance with 
international standards such as ISO 14001, ISO 50001 and ISO 45001."
"We evaluate measures that go above and 
beyond compliance with legal requirements on a cost– benefit basis."
A large amount of land owned by the Rheinmetall Group has been subject to industrial usage for decades.
"For this 
reason, it cannot be ruled out that contamination – for example as a result of production processes or processes 
to test munitions – has also been generated during this time that Rheinmetall is not yet aware of."
"Accounting 
provisions have been recognized for necessary measures to safeguard against or clean up identified pollution."
"The elimination of leaks or the clean-up of effects resulting from technical failure could give rise to direct costs for 
the company."
"It is possible that the relevant authorities may issue regulations that require costly clean-up 
measures."
"We counter potential environmental risks by implementing statutory environmental standards, certified 
environmental management systems, proper and safe storage of hazardous substances, and environmentally 
friendly disposal of waste and hazardous materials via certified service providers."
"At our different locations, 
special organizational units ensure that the relevant legislation and regulations are observed and that further 
technical options for mitigating environmental risks are identified."
"The tightening of environmental protection 
provisions and environmental standards could lead to additional unplanned costs and liability risks over which 
Rheinmetall would have no influence."
"For certain environmental risks, we have taken out liability insurance 
policies with coverage amounts that we consider customary and appropriate for the industry."
"Losses could be 
incurred from environmental damage that exceed the insured amounts or are not covered by insurance."
Risks attributable to climate change are currently already beginning to emerge.
"These can be chronic and acute 
physical risks such as the rise in average temperature, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, sharply 
fluctuating water levels, increasing heat waves and droughts affecting property."
"With regard to production sites, 
production interruptions, delivery delays or delivery failures represent significant risks."
"These may be exacerbated 
by more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as tornadoes and severe flooding."
"Transitory risks 
from climate change arise from cross-sector structural change due to the transition to a lower-carbon economy."
They relate in particular to changes in the legal framework and tighter limits at national or transnational level.
"These include, for example, increasing efforts by legislators to introduce CO₂ pricing via emissions trading 
systems, to levy additional taxes and to tighten energy legislation."
"Furthermore, Rheinmetall’s emissions balance 
and intensity could lead to a negative perception and limited attractiveness among stakeholder groups such as 
customers and investors."
"Climate protection measures also entail financial risks, for example due to increased 
energy and investment costs, emerging levies for CO2 emissions or extended specifications for products."
"We have set ourselves the ambitious goal 
of being carbon neutral by 2035."
"In addition, environmental opportunities and risks with regard to the climate are 
analyzed and assessed each year as part of reporting to the British non-government organization CDP and are 
reported publicly to customers and investors."
"With regard to the disclosure requirements for the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which were expanded significantly in 
the year under review, we consider ourselves to be well prepared and do not anticipate any additional risks, 
although we do not anticipate any significant opportunities either."
"In accordance with this framework’s 
requirements, we disclose the economic activities with which we contribute to reducing greenhouse emissions in 
the industry and the extent of their effects in this regard."
"We also strive to make our investments sustainable by 
developing specifications to integrate sustainability in the investment process right from the start, taking account 
of thresholds."
"The specific requirements regarding the personnel and 
material security measures vary depending on the degree of confidentiality."
"Material confidentiality relates to the 
technical and organizational precautions taken in the company to protect classified information."
"This involves 
measures relating to, for example, the creation, labeling, processing, duplication, management, storage, 
transportation and forwarding of classified information as well as to the security of IT systems."
"Only persons who 
have undergone state security screening to prove their dependability and been issued with authorization to handle 
classified information are permitted access to classified information."
"Like any other multinational company, Rheinmetall is at constant risk of cyberattacks and risks resulting from 
industrial espionage or sabotage."
"The risks, especially those resulting from cyberattacks, have intensified as a 
result of the war in Ukraine."
"We are unable to fully ensure that the personnel, organizational, electronic, structural 
and technical precautionary/security measures that we implement to protect confidential commercial information, 
data and material as well as our own intellectual property are sufficient and successful."
"Incidents can have a 
negative impact on our reputation, competitiveness or business situation, which is why it is important for us to 
raise awareness among our employees about the careful handling of all business-related information."
"Audits and 
the implementation of corresponding awareness measures are therefore essential."
Potential risks associated with business trips and business stays abroad (e.g.
"health risks and security risks 
through criminality or terrorism) are countered primarily through preventive measures."
"The latest information 
concerning the security situation in the destination countries is thoroughly evaluated and appraised, potentially 
resulting in travel warnings or even travel bans being announced by the Group’s management."
"Information technology and information security 
Information and data are exposed to constantly growing threats with regard to availability, confidentiality and 
integrity."
"The organizational and IT networking of locations and complex systems, as well as the growing need for remote 
access for customers and employees, are causing risks to arise."
"In addition, the use of new forms of technology 
(e.g."
"cloud technology, software-defined networks) presents opportunities that entail further risks."
"The use of 
licensed or self-created software can also harbor potential risks if the license agreements, which are subject to 
constant amendment, are not observed."
"External influences or incorrect programming and operation or even manipulation can also expose data to the risk 
of being falsified, destroyed, spied on or stolen."
"Blackmail attempts through the installation of ransomware can 
repeatedly be seen in the press."
Rheinmetall’s civilian sector was impacted by a global IT incident in April 2023.
"It 
was mainly the company’s activities addressing industrial customers – particularly in the automotive sector – that 
were affected."
"By taking action systematically, huge damage to Rheinmetall could be avoided."
"Large parts of the infrastructure 
were temporarily unavailable due to measures initiated immediately, although some systems were not at risk."
"For 
example, backup and business-critical systems were protected and not at risk."
"The systems affected or at risk 
were systematically re-established and equipped with additional security measures."
"Customers, service providers, 
and also public authorities were kept informed promptly and comprehensively throughout the entire duration of 
the re-establishment process."
The measures have been completed globally.
"Due to the continuously growing dangers, we as a company find ourselves confronted with significantly increased 
regulatory and legislative requirements."
"The installed software and hardware meet from a Group perspective the latest technological standards as a result 
of regular investment and security updates."
"Appropriate back-up and recovery procedures are also implemented, 
along with virus scanners and firewalls to avert risks."
"We are also strengthening our processes and technologies for monitoring our networks and systems so that we 
can identify anomalies or attacks early on."
"The technical configuration, functional security structures and efficient 
operation of the IT architecture are reviewed on a regular basis with competent service providers certified to ISO 
27001 and are continuously improved and adapted to the changing regulatory and legislative requirements."
"The 
level of protection is implemented and operated uniformly for the entire Rheinmetall company across all divisions."
"Ensuring the availability, reliability and confidentiality of data is a top priority."
"In addition, process harmonization 
is required in some areas of the business to provide a further basis for standardization and harmonization of IT in 
the future."
The extensive IT insourcing program launched in fiscal 2021 was continued in 2023 as well.
"As a result of the 
above-mentioned IT incident in April 2023 and the short-term focus on restoring operability in the civilian sector, 
the time planning for the IT insourcing program has been postponed."
"The continued aim of the program is to once 
again offer all core IT areas of expertise in full within the company in the medium term."
"Establishing new structures 
can temporarily result in additional risks."
"Furthermore, there is a conflict within IT between establishing operability 
and growth."
The planned and ad-hoc resource requirements push the focus onto operability.
"Based on the current 
availability of resources and business requirements, the focus is be on operability."
"Core action areas here include 
transition, stabilization and IT governance."
"Mergers and acquisitions 
Acquisitions remain an important element of the Group’s ongoing internationalization and growth strategy in order 
to improve and expand its market positioning, supplement existing business and penetrate new segments."
"In 
fiscal 2023, Rheinmetall carried out the following transactions, among others:  
The acquisition of the munitions manufacturer Expal Systems S.A.U."
"in Spain represents the largest transaction in 
the company’s history."
"Following the contract signing in November 2022, the transaction was completed on August 
1, 2023."
"It also substantially strengthens Rheinmetall’s existing product range, especially in the artillery and 
mortar ammunition and mortar weapons market segments, which are growing in the wake of the Ukraine war."
Rheinmetall will also gain direct market access to Spanish customers.
"Moreover, by expanding its available 
technologies and production capacities, Rheinmetall is reducing its dependence on suppliers for primary products 
and ammunition components."
"Retaining the technologies and jobs available at Expal Systems is essential for 
Rheinmetall."
"In the subsequent post-merger integration, the focus is particularly on realizing further synergies."
"During the implementation of these synergies, there is a risk that the effectiveness and efficiency 
of existing processes may temporarily not be guaranteed in the usual way."
"Furthermore, divestments of individual business units in the civilian sector have also been driven forward as part 
of active portfolio management."
"In fiscal 2023, Rheinmetall completed the sale of its large-bore piston business 
to the Swedish group Koncentra Verkstads AB."
"In addition, Rheinmetall and Comitans Capital AG signed the 
acquisition agreement for the entire small-bore business area on December 18, 2023."
"The purchase agreement 
covers Rheinmetall’s small-bore piston business with all production sites, where business operations and 
production are to be continued in the future."
"The parties are aiming to close the transaction, which is still subject 
to approval by the relevant authorities, as of March 31, 2024."
"At the beginning of 2024, Rheinmetall acquired a majority interest in the military vehicle manufacturer 
Automecanica Mediaș SRL in Romania, in which it will hold 72.5% of the shares via Rheinmetall Landsysteme 
GmbH in future."
The other shares in the company will remain with private owners.
"The closing of the corresponding 
contractual agreement is still subject to approval by the relevant authorities."
"The company will operate in Romania 
as Rheinmetall Automecanica SRL."
"With this acquisition, Rheinmetall is building further on its position as a leading 
manufacturer of military vehicles and strengthening its activities in Central Europe in line with its strategic 
orientation."
"In accordance with strategic requirements and guidelines, transactions are subjected to an analysis of 
opportunities and risks through standardized processes such as extensive due diligence procedures and are 
assessed on the basis of yield/risk considerations."
"When necessary, we involve external experts and consultants 
in the transaction processes."
"Furthermore, we ensure that contracts are designed in a way that is commensurate 
with the risk, in particular by obtaining warranties of specific properties or guarantees and by agreeing purchase 
price mechanisms and liability clauses or taking out appropriate insurance policies."
"Despite a careful approach, 
it is always possible that some acquisitions do not ultimately come to fruition – for example, due to regulatory 
obstacles."
"Following approval proceedings carried out over several stages, the Executive Board and/or, depending 
on whether the transaction volume exceeds defined value thresholds, the Supervisory Board of Rheinmetall AG 
decide on the implementation of the acquisition or divestment project."
"Acquisitions always harbor business risks 
because they inherently entail a range of imponderables arising from the integration of new employees, 
technologies, products and processes."
"The integration process could, for example, prove to be more difficult, time-
consuming and cost-intensive than originally expected."
"We have put in place the structures and processes 
required for ensuring the smooth integration of companies and work, for example, according to a standardized 
post-merger concept."
"Our many years of experience with the successful integration of companies also serve us 
well."
"It may also be the case that the acquired company does not fare quite as well following integration as was 
originally hoped or that the targets, synergy potential and cost-savings that the acquisition was expected to bring 
about are not, or only partially, achieved."
"In addition, risks can arise in connection with the activities of newly 
acquired companies that were either not previously known or not considered significant."
"Acquisitions can also 
negatively impact the debt ratio and financing structure and lead to an increase in assets and divestments, 
including goodwill."
"Difficulties may result primarily from impairments of goodwill due to unforeseen business 
developments."
"Furthermore, such transactions may well result in considerable acquisition, administration and 
integration expenses."
"Joint ventures and shareholdings 
One particularly noteworthy development in 2023 was the establishment of the Rheinmetall joint venture with the 
Ukrainian state-owned company Ukrainian Defense Industry JSC (UDI) in Kyiv."
"Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH 
holds 51% of the shares in the joint venture, while UDI holds 49%."
"The joint venture will operate in the areas of 
maintenance and other services, assembly, production and development of military vehicles, initially only in 
Ukrainian territory."
"The cooperation between Rheinmetall and the Ukrainian defence industry initiated in May 2023 
is intended to strengthen Ukraine's defence industry base and ultimately the country's national security."
"The 
intention is gradually to build up joint capabilities in armaments technology in Ukraine."
"Financial obligations or additional financing requirements may arise from the acquisition of a 
shareholding or the establishment of a joint venture or from their business activities."
"Joint ventures and 
shareholdings always harbor risks because it is impossible for us to counter any potential negative impact on our 
business by exerting sufficient influence over corporate governance processes or business decisions."
"Joint 
ventures also harbor risks associated with the integration of employees, technologies, products and processes."
"Likewise, strategic alliances can entail risks because, in certain areas, we might find ourselves in competition with 
the same companies with which we are also collaborating."
"Any necessary portfolio or structural measures could 
result in additional financing requirements."
"Risks affecting Group companies can result in reductions in earnings in the single-entity financial statements of 
Rheinmetall AG as the parent company."
"If there are profit transfer agreements or loss-sharing arrangements in 
place, these reductions in earnings can arise directly from the assumption of losses incurred by the Group 
companies."
"Furthermore, loss of assets or a deterioration in future prospects at the Group companies can result 
in impairment losses."
"The business policy is geared towards maintaining and expanding our current business liberties and financial 
flexibility."
"The goal is to ensure the long-term and economically successful existence of Rheinmetall for the benefit 
of all stakeholders."
"Opportunities that present themselves must be identified early and systematically and the 
accompanying potential for success must be exploited in order to be able to continue growing sustainably in 
dynamic markets."
"To identify and initially assess opportunities and success potential, the operating units are closely linked with 
functions at Group level, including Corporate Strategy and Development and Research, Technology and 
Innovation."
"At a functional level, a structured process has been established to specifically identify new 
opportunities and technological potential, evaluate them in a structured manner and transfer them to business 
areas that can be commercialized via program management."
"The operating units are involved in this process at a 
very early stage in order to increase the probability of success of the business ideas and to support the projects 
and programs during implementation."
"Potential for current business operations is managed, among other things, in regular review sessions between the 
Executive Board and the heads of the divisions and central departments."
"Based on an examination of structured 
assessments of market, industry and competition data, discussions focus on economic, market, industry and 
sales developments as well as the competitive situation and technological trends."
"The next step involves defining 
strategic initiatives and operational measures that are aimed at realizing the potential opportunities that have 
been identified."
This can entail a reallocation of budgets that are provided for exploiting opportunities.
"In addition, 
the opportunities that arise are logged and evaluated as part of the forecast prepared three times a year."
"As a technology group, we follow and promote continual product and technology innovations and their 
modifications."
"Opportunities due to increasing defence spending 
Triggered by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, NATO nations in particular are expected to increase 
their defence spending further."
"In the short and medium term, this will result 
in a rising number of new, additional armament procurement projects that offer great business potential for 
Rheinmetall as one of the most important European armed forces suppliers."
"Opportunities in increased ammunition demand and stockpiling due to changes in the global security 
situation 
The changes in the global security situation and the war in Ukraine are leading to significantly increased short-
term ammunition requirements, as well as a long-term increase in demand."
"The immediate demand for 
ammunition and explosives has thus risen substantially."
"In particular, demand for stockpiling necessary materials 
for high-intensity conflicts continues to rise, creating sales potential."
"These increased demands are exceeding 
current manufacturing capacities, and can thus only be met by expanding local production capacities."
"In addition, 
global supply shortages necessitate further relocation and insourcing of ammunition supply chains."
"Rheinmetall 
has the necessary access to customers and orders to realize its potential."
The acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U.
"will allow production capacity to be further expanded, particularly in the fast-growing market segment of artillery 
and mortar ammunition, thus enabling additional demand to be met."
"The weapons, ammunition and propulsion 
systems business has been Rheinmetall’s core business since the company was founded and makes a major 
contribution to the its success."
"Internationalization and geographical opportunities  
The Ukrainian and US defence markets in particular represent significant market development opportunities for 
Rheinmetall."
"Strategic cooperation between Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH and the Ukrainian state-owned 
company Ukrainian Defence Industry formed the basis for further developing the market and strengthening the 
Ukrainian defence industry."
"In the US, the world’s largest defence market, Rheinmetall has achieved significantly growing business successes."
"In the period from 2020 to 2023, Rheinmetall Defence achieved a growth rate of 93% in sales in the us, primarily 
due to participation in the pioneering OMFV (Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle) and CTT (Common Tactical Truck) 
projects."
"XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle (formerly OMFV) is a US Army program to replace the M2 
Bradley infantry fighting vehicle."
"The CTT solution will replace the fleet of heavy and medium wheeled logistics 
vehicles."
"Rheinmetall intends to continue optimizing its business activities from a geographical viewpoint in the future, 
according to the needs of the automotive markets."
"In this respect, Rheinmetall has created structures that identify such technology, market 
and customer trends at an early stage and have them integrated into in-house research and development projects."
"Examples include AI-supported assistance systems for soldiers on deployment, complex simulation solutions, 
autonomous system solutions for interference-free and fully automated communication or drone defence systems."
"To supplement its automation portfolio, Rheinmetall is developing autonomous and remote-controlled unmanned 
ground and air systems which are supplemented for the battlefield on the basis of digitalization solutions."
"With this strategic partnership, 
Rheinmetall will be in an even better position in the future to implement the end-to-end nature of the tactical 
information and communications network as well as the chains of effect within the system network."
"Opportunities due to fleet renewal  
Vehicle Systems is well positioned to participate successfully in the tenders for major European military vehicle 
programs in the medium to long term."
"Before the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, we anticipated 
demand for around 400 medium-weight and heavy tracked vehicles in Germany and for approximately 1,000 in 
Europe."
"For light- and medium-weight wheeled vehicles, as well as medium and heavy protected wheeled and 
tracked vehicles, we estimated demand in Germany and Europe at over 4,000 units."
"Oversees, particularly in 
Australia and the USA, we estimated more than 4,000 additional tracked vehicles and at least the same number 
of protected wheeled vehicles."
There is also strong growth in demand in the artillery sector.
"An increase in tactical 
vehicles also requires adjustment of the associated necessary logistics."
"It is therefore no surprise that demand for 
all-terrain military trucks is also rising exponentially."
"With regard to logistics vehicles, there are upcoming fleet 
regenerations comprising several tens of thousands of units, particularly on the European markets and in the US."
"In the markets relevant for Rheinmetall, we forecast market potential for military vehicles of well over €100 million 
over the next few years."
"Against the backdrop of the war in Eastern Europe, this potential and the underlying 
vehicle unit figures are likely to increase further."
"Opportunities due to consolidation of the defence market 
Other growth opportunities may arise for Rheinmetall as a result of the expected ongoing consolidation process 
in the European defence market."
"These may occur as a result of targeted acquisitions of products and/or 
technology or on the basis of company acquisitions allowing more rapid regional market access."
"Opportunities due to conventional drives  
The combustion engine is subject to increasingly stringent national and international regulations regarding the 
emission of pollutants, especially climate-damaging carbon dioxide."
"This will require ever more complex solutions 
and, in turn, additional and more sophisticated components."
"Rheinmetall offers a large range of innovative and 
competitive components and systems which take account of these rising demands."
"These include divert-air 
valves, wastegate actuators and pressure control valves for exhaust gas turbochargers as well as specially coated 
plain bearings and engine blocks, and variable oil, coolant and vacuum pumps."
"Opportunities due to expertise in lightweight construction 
In parallel with the transition toward electromobility, lightweight construction methods will play an increasingly 
important role."
"With this expertise, Rheinmetall is helping global automotive manufacturers to achieve the increasingly stringent 
CO2 targets and to shape the path to sustainable electromobility."
"Opportunities due to electrification 
Demand for electric drives and hybrid vehicles as a bridge technology to electromobility will increase."
"With 
components as well as complex systems for heating and cooling electric drive components, purely electrically 
operated auxiliary units, and numerous power electronics applications (e.g."
"DC link capacitors, high-voltage 
contactors), as well as lightweight cast components such as battery trays and structural and chassis parts for 
electric vehicles, Rheinmetall sees great opportunities for continuing growth in this transformation toward 
alternative drive forms."
"By integrating the charging electronics 
into a curb, the curb effectively becomes a charging station."
"Rheinmetall curb chargers blend almost invisibly into 
the urban landscape and offer solutions to the challenges of existing charging systems – such as high space 
requirements, low point density, deterioration of the urban landscape and high costs."
"Initial pilot projects in public 
spaces are currently being designed."
"Opportunities due to digitalization 
The integration of biometric technology, AI software and digitalization solutions is progressing and picking up 
pace."
"Rheinmetall Dermalog SensorTec GmbH, a joint venture of the technology group Rheinmetall AG and 
DERMALOG Identification Systems GmbH, Germany’s largest biometrics company, combines automotive and 
industrial know-how with biometrics expertise."
"The strategic partnership allows for a unique market position and 
promotes innovative solutions in the areas of automotive vehicle interiors (driver monitoring and in-cabin sensing 
applications), security and industry."
"For the Rheinmetall Group, the joint venture is a key component of its 
transformation to digitalization technology and the expansion of its product portfolio."
"Opportunities in the area of ecological and economic sustainability 
New drive systems, driven by synthetic fuels, power or hydrogen will play a great role in the future, also with 
military vehicles."
"With its expertise in the civilian business, Rheinmetall can generate extensive synergies here for 
developing military vehicles."
"Furthermore, the assessment across the entire life cycle from development, including 
operations right up to recycling, secures additional opportunities for both ecological and economic sustainability."
"Diversification and accessing new markets 
As part of the transformation of the civilian sector, new business areas are being analyzed and evaluated with 
regard to sustainable, profitable growth potential and their strategic fit."
"Under the umbrella term of 
decarbonization, Rheinmetall has begun to address a diversified business area with high growth potential for the 
civil sector."
Transferability to the defence sector is also being assessed and opens up further growth potential.
"Within decarbonization, warm home and hydrogen technologies are focus areas for Rheinmetall."
"In the warm home 
area, the focus is on the development and supply of components such as circulation pumps, heating pumps and 
compressors, as Rheinmetall has extensive technological and development expertise."
"Opportunities due to hydrogen technology   
The hydrogen technology field is an important element of our strategy."
"As a proven technology partner, 
Rheinmetall has been contributing to the optimization of hydrogen use for many years and thus acting in the 
interests of the desired energy transition – both for vehicles of various categories and for stationary systems."
"Alongside the secure production and distribution of hydrogen and data security for the hydrogen infrastructure, 
our commitment will also continue to focus on alternative drive systems and on the fuel cell system itself."
"Rheinmetall already has technologies and products that will be necessary in the further development of the 
energy of tomorrow."
"The spectrum ranges from renewable power generation to the production of hydrogen, its 
storage, its distribution and its use."
"As part of Germany’s national hydrogen initiative, Rheinmetall AG is an 
industrial partner to the Innovation and Technology Center for Hydrogen Technology in Duisburg."
"At Sensors and 
Actuators, Rheinmetall develops innovative solutions to support the industry with high-quality hydrogen 
products."
"Rheinmetall is now the market leader for recirculation blowers, cathode valves and coolant pumps for 
fuel cell systems."
"An effective and 
efficient internal control system is crucial to successfully managing risks in our business processes."
"The internal 
control system at Rheinmetall goes beyond controls in the accounting process."
"Rheinmetall’s internal control system (ICS) is based on the internationally recognized ICS framework of the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and auditing standard 982 of the 
Institute of Public Auditors, Germany (IDW PS 982)."
"The focus of the ICS at Rheinmetall is on appropriate and 
effective internal controls to ensure proper and reliable financial reporting."
"In addition to the separation of 
functions and the application of the principle of dual control, this primarily includes appropriate monitoring 
measures in the context of period-end closures as well as fixed asset, accounts payable and accounts receivable 
accounting."
"The audit plan establishes the focal areas 
for the risk-oriented audit activities and the scope of the audits to be performed."
"These are then implemented by 
Rheinmetall employees or auditing companies as mandated by Rheinmetall AG."
"If necessary, the Executive Board 
will also commission Internal Audit to conduct special audits on an ad hoc basis."
"Risks identified and weaknesses 
discovered during audits are promptly eliminated by those responsible in each case."
"The central department 
Internal Audit monitors implementation of the necessary improvement measures."
"The Executive Board and Audit 
Committee of the Supervisory Board are regularly informed of the results of the audit and of the implementation 
status of improvement measures."
"The Governance Risk and Compliance Committee, which comprises the heads of Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, 
Accounting, and Controlling and Risk Management, also deals with the implementation, management and 
compliance of internal processes at its regular meetings."
"The Executive Board also addresses the company’s risk 
situation at its monthly Executive Board meetings as part of update reports on the business situation."
"For our 
assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system and the internal control 
system, please refer to the remarks under »Corporate governance statement."
"In addition to 
defined control mechanisms, (e.g."
"manual coordination processes and technical coordination processes for 
systems), this includes the separation of administrative, executive, settlement and approval functions together 
with guidelines and operating instructions."
"Changes to the economic, legal and regulatory environment of the 
Rheinmetall Group are analyzed to determine whether adjustments to the accounting-related control system are 
necessary."
"Accounting guidelines – Our IFRS accounting guidelines cover all the regulations of the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are of relevance to Rheinmetall AG."
"They explain the IFRS regulations and specify 
accounting procedures."
"The guidelines must be observed by all companies included in the consolidated financial 
statements, thereby ensuring standardized accounting."
"The accounting guidelines are reviewed at least once a 
year and amended where necessary."
Companies are informed about specific changes to guidelines.
"The content 
of the guidelines is the responsibility of the main Accounting department of Rheinmetall AG."
"The accounts and financial statements are prepared using SAP-based 
accounting systems (SAP-FI)."
"Procedures, such as document checks for formal and material correctness, the 
separation of functions and IT-based plausibility checks, are implemented in the accounting process to ensure 
the correctness of the accounts and financial statements."
"The management of each Group company monitors 
compliance with IFRS accounting guidelines and other guidelines and operating instructions in force across the 
Group."
The management must confirm the correctness of the financial statements in a corresponding declaration.
"Consolidation and Group accounting process – The main Accounting department of Rheinmetall AG is responsible 
for central management of the Group accounting process."
"It stipulates the schedule for the consolidated financial 
statements and monitors compliance with deadlines."
"The consolidated financial statements of Rheinmetall AG are drawn up with the aid of the consolidation software 
SAP SEM-BCS."
"A standardized, binding chart of accounts is incorporated into this system, which covers virtually 
all the information required for the IFRS consolidated financial statements of Rheinmetall AG."
"The individual 
companies record the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting guidelines in the 
consolidation software."
"After this IFRS single-entity financial statement data is recorded, it then undergoes an 
automatic plausibility check and system-based validation."
"If error or warning messages are displayed during this 
process, these are to be analyzed and dealt with by the person responsible for the single-entity financial 
statements."
"Employees in the main Accounting department then perform additional automatic and manual 
checks."
"The manual and automated consolidation measures undergo system-based checks and automatic 
plausibility checks."
"The consolidated financial statements are also audited on the basis of standardized reports using comparisons 
of target and actual performance, trend and deviation analyses and detailed evaluations."
"A check is carried out 
every quarter to ensure the completeness of the scope of consolidation."
"The auditors examine the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report to determine 
whether they comply with applicable accounting regulations and other relevant provisions."
"The auditors check 
whether the IFRS accounting guidelines have been applied to the financial statements prepared for consolidation 
purposes and establish the correctness of the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with applicable 
accounting principles."
"The audit procedures performed by these auditors also include an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system based on spot checks in subdivisions."
"The aforementioned risks are not necessarily the 
only risks to which the Rheinmetall Group is exposed."
"Risks that have not yet been identified or that are still 
deemed insignificant can materialize under altered circumstances, hinder business activities and adversely 
impact the assets, financial situation and earnings of the Group."
"Our business policy is geared towards 
maintaining and expanding our current business liberties and financial flexibility."
"The goal is to ensure the long-
term and economically successful existence of Rheinmetall for the benefit of all stakeholders."
"Opportunities that 
present themselves must be identified early and systematically and the accompanying potential for success must 
be exploited."
"Overall, the Rheinmetall Group assumes that the outlook for opportunities is good, particularly 
thanks to the German government’s declared intention to increase defence spending significantly."
"Increasing 
defence budgets and business opportunities for Rheinmetall are also to be anticipated in other European 
countries as a result of the Ukraine war."
"In accordance with the basis outlined for the assessment of risk factors and taking into account 
the overall risk situation, major asset, financial and earnings risks jeopardizing the Rheinmetall Group on a long-
term basis were not identifiable during the past fiscal year."
"Compared with the previous year, the overall risk 
situation of the Rheinmetall Group did not change significantly in fiscal 2023, despite persistently high inflation 
rates and associated price increases, for example for raw materials and energy."
"A large part of these cost increases 
were hedged using price adjustment clauses."
"The assessment of the overall risk situation is the product of 
consolidated consideration of all individual material risks."
"We are confident that the risks presented are limited 
and manageable."
"Economic growth in industrialized countries in 
particular remains subdued for the moment."
"Dramatically elevated interest rates are still having a curbing effect, 
which is stifling consumer spending and corporate investment."
"The impact of less favorable monetary conditions 
in the form of higher interest rates has been visible for quite some time already, particularly in the context of 
housing construction."
"The problem is especially pronounced in the United States, but this is also the case for 
some European countries including Germany."
"Financial policy is also serving as a restraint on the economy, since 
measures designed to boost purchasing power have been scaled back."
"Some degree of relief can be expected on 
the part of inflation rates, which have already been trending downwards due to factors including central banks’ 
expansive monetary policy and stand to limit private consumers’ willingness to spend to a lesser degree."
"Lower 
inflation rates will also potentially give central banks room to begin bringing rates back down again this year, 
which should have a positive impact on economic momentum."
"Growth of the US economy will most likely weaken to some extent in 2024, with GDP growth of 1.6%."
"Factors 
pointing to a slowdown include subdued sentiment in the corporate sector and waning labor market momentum."
Growth of 0.9% is expected for the eurozone.
Restrained overseas demand is weighing on the European economy.
"In Germany, gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by only 0.3%, constrained not least of all by the 
necessary saving measures enacted by the German government."
"China is expected to see moderate growth of 
4.5% in 2024."
Obstacles to more dynamic growth there include structural issues and the weak global economy.
"Following growth in global economic output by 3.0% in 2023, 2024 will most likely see only below-average growth 
of 2.8%, and thus another mild loss of growth momentum."
"Growth of just 1.2% is expected in the industrialized 
countries, with emerging markets set for much more dynamic growth of around 3.9%."
"In 2025, the global growth 
rate is expected to recover to a slightly higher level of 3.0%."
"Lower inflation rates for 2024 
Projections for the global inflation rate in 2024 currently average 6.4%."
"In 2023, global inflation measured 6.9%."
Germany is expected to see a much lower inflation rate of 2.6% in 2024.
"A relatively high inflation rate of 9.3% is 
expected for emerging and developing countries, while industrialized countries are expected to average 2.5%."
"For 
2025, experts anticipate another pronounced reduction in global inflation to 3.9%."
"High political priority for defence capability – defence spending rising further 
In light of the current and prospectively increasing geopolitical risks, IHS Jane’s forecasts that global defence 
spending will amount to roughly $2,398 billion in 2024."
"It will therefore significantly exceed the forecast made 
before the Ukraine war and reach a level 3.1% higher than that of the previous year (previous year: $2,327 billion)."
"The global trend of increasing defence spending is chiefly due to the responses to the Ukraine war, which have 
resulted in higher defence budgets in Europe in particular."
"For Europe, IHS Jane’s is forecasting spending of 
$442 billion in 2024."
"Germany's defence spending is projected to rise to a record high of roughly €74 billion in the 
current year."
"Of this amount, €51.8 billion originates from the regular defence budget and a further E19.2 billion 
stems from the German armed forces’ special fund for military procurement."
"Although European defence budgets will see high growth in 2024 on the whole, North America and Asia-Pacific 
remain the regions with the highest defence spending this year at $914 billion and $597 billion, respectively."
"In 
the US, experts anticipate defence spending of $895 billion in 2024, after $910 billion the year before."
"China is 
expected to increase its spending to $276 billion this year, after spending $263 billion last year."
The experts from IHS Jane’s see continuing growth potential in the years ahead.
"They expect global spending of 
$2,448 billion in 2025."
"By 2028, global defence spending is expected to grow to $2,575 billion."
"For the US, IHS 
Jane’s expects spending of $893 billion in 2025."
"In Germany, the experts foresee spending of $81 billion next year."
"In its military business, Rheinmetall still 
expects to receive stable orders in 2024, partly from the defence budget for the German armed forces."
"Framework agreements for 155mm artillery ammunition and 120mm tank ammunition, for example, have been 
expanded and extended for the years ahead."
Tank ammunition for Ukraine is also part of the order package.
"Moreover, Rheinmetall considers itself well positioned for orders in connection with the procurement of tactical 
and logistic vehicles and for orders from the Air Defence sector."
"As Germany’s largest defence technology group, Rheinmetall anticipates a continued surge in overall demand in 
2024 from the existing backlog and modernization requirements of the German armed forces and from the 
international environment due to an increased need for security."
"Due to these stress factors, IHS Markit analysts expect global production of passenger cars and light-duty 
commercial vehicles up to 6.0 t to decrease slightly to 89.4 million units in 2024."
"This puts production volume 
0.4% below the comparable figure for 2023, in which roughly 89.8 million vehicles left the assembly line."
"In terms of automotive production, IHS Markit forecasts growth of 0.5% for the USMCA region in 2024, with growth 
of 3.9% in the US and a slight decrease by 0.2% for production in Mexico."
"A dramatic decrease of 19.9% is 
expected for Canada."
"IHS also expects lower production in Western Europe, where their experts project a 2.3% decline in production in 
2024."
"Germany, however, is expected to see growth of 3.6%."
"Stagnant development is expected in France, while 
a decrease by 3.6% is projected for Spain."
"According to IHS Markit’s forecast, the United Kingdom will see a 
considerable decrease of 10.7%, and production in Italy will decrease by 8.9%."
"In Central and Eastern Europe, 
production volumes are expected to decline by 1.9%."

In Asia, IHS Markit expects a minor decrease in production volume by 0.3% in 2024."
"The forecast projects virtually 
stagnant growth for China, while production in Japan is expected to decrease by 3.1%."
"For the Indian automotive 
market, low growth of 3.6% is projected for 2024."
"The shift toward electric vehicles 
is also expected to lead to growth opportunities for the commercial vehicle market."
"The introduction of strict 
emissions regulations is also likely to serve as an incentive for automotive manufacturers to switch to alternative 
drive systems in the commercial vehicle segment as well."
"Pressure to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas 
emissions caused by burning diesel fuel will likely be stepped up worldwide."
"This is also expected to lead to 
increased investment in the development of electric trucks."
"Transformation of the automotive industry – Rheinmetall well-positioned with products for electromobility 
Progress towards electromobility is expected to advance in 2024, at least in terms of the overall trend."
"The 
regulatory requirements of policymakers regarding stricter CO2 limits are already prompting automotive 
manufacturers to expand their share of electric vehicles in production."
"Despite the macroeconomic uncertainties, 
Rheinmetall is confident that it will be able to participate in the market opportunities arising from the increasing 
electrification of drive systems in 2024."
"With its innovative systems and components for electromobility, Rheinmetall is extremely well positioned for this."
"At the same time, Rheinmetall continues to contribute to the optimization of the combustion engine."
"Rheinmetall 
also expects orders on a noteworthy scale, especially in the area of fuel cell technology, which will have a role to 
play in the medium term, particularly for commercial vehicles."
"This is demonstrated by numerous sales successes in recent years, which have boosted Rheinmetall’s 
annual order intake and order backlog to a new quantity level and form the foundation for sales growth over the 
next few years."
"With its international network of 
locations for munition and vehicle plants, Rheinmetall has sufficient production capacity to react to additional 
orders in a flexible fashion."
"To secure its core business in the field of weapons, ammunition, and propulsion systems in a sustainable manner, 
Rheinmetall concluded a significant acquisition in 2023: On August 1, 2023, the company acquired the Spanish 
company Expal Systems S.A.U., a globally renowned munitions manufacturer."
"Given the dynamic market situation 
driven by the further increase in demand for military equipment in many countries, Rheinmetall is securing the 
fastest possible access to significant additional capacity in the ammunition business."
"In this way, Rheinmetall is 
optimally positioning itself for further new tenders for ammunition procurement in view of the foreseeably high 
demand."
"In cooperation with its US partners Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, Rheinmetall has begun construction 
of a state-of-the-art factory for the center fuselages of F-35 Lightning II fighter planes."
"The symbolic groundbreaking 
at the airport in Weeze took place on August 1, 2023."
"The F-35 Lightning II is the most advanced fighter jet in the 
world at present."
It will also be procured by the German Air Force.
"Over 400 highly qualified new employees will 
operate a cutting-edge assembly line at this site."
"The facility will also comprise logistical and warehouse areas, 
research and testing centers, training facilities, and quality control."
"At least 400 F-35 center fuselages are to be 
produced at the new plant for the German Air Force and allied governments."
"In this context, Rheinmetall can 
contribute its experience both as an integrated technology group in the production of complex components and 
as a certified aeronautical company."
Production is slated to begin in 2025.
Rheinmetall has also achieved success in another key project for the US armed forces.
"As part of the “Team Lynx” 
industrial team, American Rheinmetall Vehicles has received the order for phases 3 and 4 of the US Army’s XM30 
program."
"The Lynx OMFV is a cutting-edge infantry fighting vehicle featuring superior protection, high penetrative 
power, outstanding mobility, and an open system architecture."
"The total contract value for phases 3 and 4 is in 
excess of $700 million."
"In addition, American Rheinmetall Vehicles and GM Defense LLC have been awarded the 
contract for the first phase of the US Army's Common Tactical Truck (CTT) program."
"The goal of this multi-stage 
program is to replace the US Army’s heavy tactical truck family through the production of up to 40,000 vehicles 
worth as much as $14 billion."
"Rheinmetall also officially opened its new factory in Zalaegerszeg, Hungary, in August 2023."
"The new factory is a 
significant milestone for Rheinmetall and underscores the company’s commitment to the Hungarian market."
"The 
Lynx infantry fighting vehicle, one of the most advanced infantry fighting vehicles in the world, will be 
manufactured at the cutting-edge production site in the future."
"The contractual agreement encompasses 209 Lynx 
KF41 vehicles in 7 variants, 18 support vehicles including the Bergepanzer 3 Büffel armored recovery vehicle, and 
38 military trucks."
"The contract also includes further services such as simulators, training, and education, as well 
as an initial supply of replacement parts and maintenance services."
"Replacement parts and maintenance 
measures will be necessary over the decades-long useful life expected for the Lynx in order to keep vehicles 
operationally ready."
"This project is serving to deepen the close cooperation and defensive partnership between the two 
nations in the context of ground defence."
"The “schwerer Waffenträger Infanterie”(sWaTrInf) is based on the Boxer 
CRV, An 8x8 combat vehicle with a proven track record and equipped with a wheeled armored scout vehicle 
mission module, including the “Lance” two-person turret."
"The Rheinmetall MK30-2 ABM automatic cannon, which 
is also built into Germany's Puma infantry fighting vehicle, serves as the primary weapon."
"The German armed 
forces prospectively intend to procure 100 Boxer sWaTrInf vehicles as a replacement for the Wiesel tracked vehicle 
as direct tactical fire support for their infantry units."
Deliveries are expected to begin in 2025.
"We have also received other important orders over the past fiscal year which underscore our growth opportunities 
in the area of security and defence technology and are of particular strategic importance to Rheinmetall."
"The 
German armed forces have expanded an existing framework agreement with Rheinmetall to deliver tank 
ammunition, for example."
"The 
framework agreement also provides for the delivery of a significant quantity of tank ammunition for the Ukrainian 
armed forces."
"Rheinmetall has also received a new framework agreement from the German armed forces to deliver 
155mm artillery ammunition, and an existing framework agreement has been expanded."
"In total, the delivery of 
several hundred thousand shells of various types, including fuses and propelling charges, is intended."
"The new 
framework agreement will remain in effect into 2029 and encompass a potential gross order volume of roughly 
€1.2 billion."
"Rheinmetall is recording a steadily rising share of new 
business booked for components relating to new vehicle models with hybrid or purely electrical drives."
"But in the 
last fiscal year considerable new orders were also posted in the area of fuel cell technology, which will have a role 
to play in the medium term, particularly for commercial vehicles."
"In addition, at its Neuss site Rheinmetall is establishing a high-performance technology and industrialization 
center for mobile, and also for stationary, hydrogen technology applications."
"Alongside the secure production and 
distribution of hydrogen and data security for the hydrogen infrastructure, the focus will be on fuel cell systems."
"In Neuss it is planned to in the future advance in-house product-related research, development and 
industrialization of hydrogen technology."
"Since the beginning of 2021, Pistons, which combines small- and large-
bore piston business, has been continued as a non-core business and has been recognized as a discontinued 
operation since the beginning of May 2021."
"At the beginning of 2023, Rheinmetall transferred its activities in the 
area of large-bore piston production to the Swedish group Koncentra Verkstads AB (KVAB), Gothenburg, as 
planned."
"Rheinmetall had announced the sale, which took place in the course of a strategic reorientation of the 
Düsseldorf-based technology group, in October 2022."
"Following assessment and approval by the relevant 
authorities, the closing of the transaction was carried out with retroactive effect as of January 1, 2023."
"At the end 
of 2023, Rheinmetall completed another important step of the strategic reorientation and spun off its activities in 
the area of small-bore piston production."
"Rheinmetall and Comitans Capital AG signed a sale and purchase 
agreement for the entire small-bore piston business area."
"In doing so, Rheinmetall took another step towards its 
strategic objective – as far as civilian activities are concerned – of focusing on new areas of technology and 
alternative drive systems in the future."
"The purchase agreement encompasses Rheinmetall’s small-bore piston 
business area and all relevant production sites."
"A total of roughly 3,650 employees work at the plants in 
Neckarsulm (Germany), Marinette (USA), Celaya (Mexico), Nova Odessa (Brazil), Trmice (Czech Republic), 
Hiroshima (Japan), and two locations of Chinese joint venture KSHP in Shanghai and Chongqing."
"Business 
operations and production are intended to continue at all locations."
"The parties are aiming to close the 
transaction, which is still subject to approval by the relevant authorities, as of March 31, 2024."
"Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to shape the development of general economic conditions 
As of the beginning of fiscal 2024, numerous risk factors and thus a relatively high degree of unpredictability apply 
in regard to the economic situation at the national and international levels."
"Geopolitical risks in particular have 
recently increased to a significant extent."
"In addition to Russia's ongoing war of aggression, other factors including 
the terror attacks on Israel by Hamas are resulting in a high potential for conflict in the Middle East."
"The 
development of the Chinese economy also continues to pose a significant downside risk to the global economy."
"Due to this general situation and the resulting potential risks for business performance, Rheinmetall is also facing 
forecast uncertainty regarding sales and earnings performance in fiscal 2024."
"General conditions for security technology remain positive; recovery of automotive markets is slowing 
We still consider the general conditions for our defence activities to be highly stable and positive."
"In the light of 
actual or potential conflicts, the modernization or replacement of military equipment is still ranked as a priority in 
many of the countries we supply."
"In view of the ongoing military conflict in the Ukraine and potential conflicts in 
other parts of the world, investments in national security are becoming more important in many places."
"This is 
reflected particularly in the increased, and in some countries, further increasing defence spending."
"Our 
expectations of a continued growth trajectory in business with products for military and civilian security services 
are based on this and on the historically high order backlog in the defence technology units."
"In contrast, the automotive markets that Rheinmetall supplies continue to face comparatively high volatility risks."
"In line with expert forecasts, we currently expect international automotive production to see stagnant development 
at best in 2024."
"Rheinmetall Group forecast 2024: Sales growth with rising margins 
Based on the current market outlooks, we anticipate significant growth in sales and anticipate a rising operating 
margin combined with an improved operating result in fiscal 2024."
"The Rheinmetall Group’s annual sales are expected to rise to a level of around €10 billion in fiscal 2024 (sales in 
fiscal 2023: €7.2 billion)."
"Based on this sales forecast and taking into account holding costs, Rheinmetall is 
expecting to see an improvement in the Group operating result and the Group operating margin of around 14%-
15% (margin in fiscal 2023: 12.8%)."
"The operating margin is expected to range from 12% to 13% (segment margin in 
2023: 12.4%)."
"Based on the very good order situation and rising sales in the core business (ammunition), we anticipate 
considerable sales growth of between 55% and 65% in the Weapon and Ammunition segment in fiscal 2024 
(segment sales in 2023: €1,756 million)."
"The operating margin is expected to range from 25% to 26% (segment 
margin in 2023: 23.0%)."
The operating margin is expected to range from 12% to 13% (segment margin in 2023: 11.4%).
"The operating 
margin is expected be around 7% (pro forma segment margin in 2023: 6.8%)."
"Development of other Group key figures and key performance indicators in fiscal 2024 
In terms of operating free cash flow (OFCF) from continuing operations, we expect to achieve a target corridor of 
around 40% of the operating result in fiscal 2024."
"This new Group key figure is defined as the cash conversion 
rate (CCR) and replaces the previous definition of OFCF as a ratio to sales (OFCF in fiscal 2023: €356 million or 
38.8% of the operating result)."
"Positive net income of €250 million to €300 million is expected for the management holding company Rheinmetall 
AG in fiscal 2024 (net income in 2023: €393 million)."
"We lead 
lives that are more global, more connected, more digital than ever before and are constantly faced with new 
challenges that have to be overcome."
"We have consistently demonstrated our responsibility toward our employees 
and products and toward the environment and society for over 130 years."
"Founded in 1889, our technology 
company – rooted regionally and globally positioned – with its companies is integrated into the general political, 
regulatory, economic, ecological and social conditions of various countries and geographical regions."
"The 
Rheinmetall Group’s business model is described in detail under »Basic information on the Rheinmetall Group."
"We are committed to fair competition and to lawful business conduct that not only shows integrity but is also 
social and ethical."
"Sustainable management has always been an integral component of our business and 
production processes and helps to secure the long-term future of our company."
"Globally, European and German understanding on key areas, topics and aspects in the Environment, Social and 
Governance (ESG) categories may not be equally assessed, weighted and prioritized."
"This relates to the impact of business activities on sustainable development in the world 
encompassing the entire value-added chain."
"But customers, shareholders, investors, non-governmental 
organizations and – not least – the company’s own employees are also interested in getting a full picture of the 
company, its global business activities and their impact on people, the climate, and the environment."
"Inquiries 
from all sections of society are thereby increasing, as are expectations for transparency, scope, level of detail, 
informative value and comparability of company data on the very complex issue of sustainability."
"Governance 
This non-financial statement of the Group, which includes all continuing and discontinued business activities, 
was prepared in line with the requirements of Sections 315b, 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB."
"Pursuant to section 315b(1) sentence 3 HGB, reference is made to the non-financial disclosures included in another 
part of the Group management report for more detailed information on individual aspects."
"We use the standards 
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as a reporting basis when preparing the non-financial statement."
"In this way 
we want to ensure transparency and comparability."
"The fiscal year is the reporting period for the non-financial 
statement of the Group, and there is an annual reporting cycle."
"Sustainability organization 
At Rheinmetall the responsibility for sustainability lies with the Executive Board as a whole."
"The central area 
Corporate Social Responsibility reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)."
"In consultation with the 
responsible central department managed by the Head of Corporate Social Responsibility, the Executive Board sets 
the strategic framework for sustainability activities."
"In cooperation with the divisional and local sustainability 
officers and the Executive Board, the Corporate Social Responsibility department bundles and coordinates the 
respective ESG requirements."
"From this, it develops the sustainability strategy aligned to the Group strategy and 
derives the resulting fields of action, measures, targets and indicators."
"The Corporate Sustainability Board deals with current regulatory developments and trends in the ESG 
area, as well as with the challenges they pose for Rheinmetall."
"At the two meetings in April 2023 and October 2023, 
the heads of the divisions presented the measures implemented and progress made in the area of ESG during the 
year and provided an outlook on the activities planned for 2024."
"Furthermore, since May 2023, the heads of the 
divisions have reported on current developments, planned activities in the environmental area and progress in 
the implementation of measures at the extended Executive Board meeting."
Sustainability also includes a material strategic component.
"As an interdisciplinary and cross-division topic, ESG 
is a fixed element of the activity of the Supervisory Board."
"For example, the members of the Supervisory Board 
deal with current ESG developments, their significance for the corporation and its stakeholders and the resulting 
current and future effects, risks and opportunities."
"The Strategy, Technology and ESG Committee deals with the strategic further development 
of sustainability and its enshrinement in the overall strategy of the company."
"It obtains information on the 
associated ESG fields of action, measures and initiatives, as well as on the progress made, and monitors the 
inclusion of sustainability aspects in the business model."
"The Supervisory Board’s Personnel and Remuneration 
Committee deals with the implementation of ESG objectives in internal performance indicators and their 
consideration in remuneration systems."
"As part of the Executive Board’s remuneration, it defines the ESG criteria, 
their target values and target achievement ranges on an annual basis and assesses the respective degree of 
achievement of the non-financial targets."
"Sustainability management 
Ongoing further development aligned to the changing requirements of our time is the basis for sustainability 
activities at Rheinmetall."
"In cooperation with the ESG experts in the divisions, business units and national 
companies, the central CSR department works to continuously improve the Group’s sustainability performance."
"Furthermore – alongside key performance indicators – non-financial aspects from the environmental and social 
areas are also included in target agreements with the members of the Executive Board."
"These define targets for 
variable remuneration components relevant to ESG, including areas such as energy efficiency, reduction of CO2 
emissions or health and safety at work."
"For senior and middle management, the achievement of environmental 
and social targets will now be taken into account at 20% in the short-term and long-term incentive from fiscal 
2024."
"In addition to the legal requirements, we publish the ESG Factbook reporting annually."
"On more than 130 pages, 
we provide information in the Performance, People, Planet and Governance categories on topics defined as 
material and present our economic, social and ecological performance over a period of three years."
"In addition, 
the Factbook includes the GRI Content Index."
"An additional index refers to the covered reporting requirements of 
the SASB in the sectors relevant to our business model."
"In accordance with the UN Global Compact, a worldwide pact between the United Nations and companies for the 
social and ecological shaping of globalization, we published our annual progress report, the Communication on 
Progress (CoP), in June 2023."
"With this report we show transparently what progress the company has made in the 
area of corporate responsibility over a year."
"The result of the materiality analysis reflects the economic, 
environmental and social sustainability issues that are significant for our company."
"The focus of our reporting is 
on the topics classified as very material and material."
"For some other aspects, our voluntary reporting in this non-
financial statement ensures that the justified interest and information needs of various stakeholders are taken 
into account by providing information on the Rheinmetall Group’s approach."
"In the past 
fiscal year, an initial double materiality analysis was carried out in accordance with CSRD, which will be updated 
in the coming year, taking into account the support documents provided by EFRAG and other factors, and will form 
the basis for our reporting in future."
"Integration of stakeholder groups 
We want to live up to our social responsibility, take advantage of growth opportunities and successively anchor 
ecological and social aspects even more firmly in our business activities."
"Sustainability management at Rheinmetall also takes account of the 
precautionary principle."
"Any possible adverse impact on humans and the environment as a result of the Group's 
business activities should be considered at an early stage and be excluded or reduced as far as possible."
"If we 
know the interests, positions, attitudes, opinions and concerns of our key stakeholders, we can focus our 
commercial decisions more effectively in line with their expectations."
"This allows us to establish and develop important 
relationships as well as to receive inspiration and specific proposals at an early stage, also for our sustainability 
strategy and activities."
"For the exchange with our customers, we use a wide range of formats, such as personal meetings and participation 
in international trade shows."
For Rheinmetall direct contact with capital market participants is extremely important.
"The Executive Board and 
Investor Relations team are engages in continuous dialog with investors and analysts and participate in investor 
conferences and road shows in Europe and the US."
"In addition, there were numerous telephone calls with 
investors, analysts and private investors."
"Properly registered shareholders were able to put their questions on the 
topic of ESG to the Executive Board at the Annual General Meeting held virtually on May 9, 2023."
Satisfied and motivated employees are an important success factor for our company.
"Employee commitment and 
satisfaction have been measured at regular intervals since 2022."
"Employees can use a link or QR code to take part 
anonymously in the Group-wide online Pulse survey and share their opinions on topics that are important to the 
Group."
"In addition to emerging trends and changes, the need for action can also be quickly identified and, if 
necessary, targeted measures can be determined."
"The anonymous results of the survey are made available to 
employees and managers in the form of dashboards shortly after the survey is completed."
"A total of 14,848 
employees took part in the last Pulse survey in November 2023 (previous year: 14,584)."
More than ever the world is subject to dynamic change.
"Today responsible and effective representation of interests 
means that with their expert knowledge and publication of positions companies are involved on a constructive 
and transparent basis in discussions in society and in the political and economic arenas."
"They can use their 
expertise for developing general conditions and viable solutions which promote sustainable business and secure 
the good of today’s and future generations."
"Our lobby work is determined by factual information and is 
characterized by integrity, fairness and transparency."
"Rheinmetall participates actively in various associations and 
organizations to represent its interests in a wide range of ways."
"Political exchange also takes place in the context 
of the normal industry and sector association activities."
"In addition, we have representative offices in Berlin and 
Koblenz."
"Furthermore, we have a commitment at European level in Brussels."
"Furthermore, in a first step, the 
management companies of the divisions will successively undergo the rating process on the EcoVadis platform."
"EcoVadis analyzes the sustainability performance of companies in the areas of environment, labor and human 
rights, ethics and sustainable procurement."
"In addition to customer ratings, internationally recognized ESG ratings and ESG rankings document our 
commitment to sustainability in the areas of the environment, social issues and corporate governance."
"These 
results are used as a decision-making tool, for example by institutional investors."
"Technology and innovation 
Our corporate responsibility is apparent in our products."
"Innovative strength and technological competence are 
key measures of competitiveness in the rapidly changing world of business."
"Tradition and innovation – the 
Rheinmetall technology group can draw on more than 130 years of specialist knowledge, system expertise and 
industry experience in the civilian and military business sectors."
"Our consistent focus on technology is a 
prerequisite for not only picking up on the developments of our time, but also for actively helping to shape 
technological change and, as a result, achieving long-term business success in a diverse range of technologically 
demanding markets."
Details are provided in the “Research and development” section.
"We provide information on 
relevant risks in the »Risks and opportunities section."
"Environmental protection and conservation 
Management approach 
Business activities and, in particular, production processes are associated with the consumption of natural 
resources."
"From our perspective, environmental protection and conservation play a major role in ensuring we have 
a sustainable future that is worth living."
"The careful use of natural resources is part of how the Rheinmetall Group 
views itself."
"Using raw materials and energy economically and avoiding environmental damage in business and 
production processes are also among the key foundations on which the Group companies’ business activities are 
based, as is dealing with residual materials and emissions responsibly."
"It is of key importance here that 
environmental protection – in keeping with a holistic approach – is considered an integral part of our management 
system in the Rheinmetall companies."
"Environmental management 
We make every effort to further minimize our environmental impact with the best economically viable technology."
"Handling materials, 
energy, water and waste in a considered manner not only protects the environment, but also reduces costs at the 
same time."
We continue to strive to use resources even more efficiently.
"Safe and modern facilities at certified 
production sites ensure resource-conserving and low-emission production processes as far as possible."
"Country-
specific regulations and the requirements of international standards for quality (ISO 9001, IATF 16949 and AQAP 
2110/2210), environmental protection (ISO 14001) and energy management systems (ISO 50001) are observed and 
processes are certified accordingly."
"Regular audits ensure transparency in terms of the status quo and provide 
objective confirmation of high quality standards."
"Energy management 
We need a sufficient energy supply, which is associated with corresponding CO2 emissions, to manufacture our 
products and operate our buildings and infrastructure."
"The reduction of energy-related payments is therefore a 
key component of corporate policy in the Rheinmetall Group."
"It is a material objective for us to reduce energy 
consumption and increase energy efficiency through stringent processes in day-to-day operations within the 
context of that which is technically feasible and economic circumstances."
"We select our energy resources based on supply reliability, economic efficiency and environmental 
considerations, and use a mix of non-renewable and renewable energies during our everyday business."
"In July 2023, the newly established Strategic Energy Procurement department commenced its activities."
"Its aim is 
to develop the foundations for uniform, economical, safe and sustainable energy procurement within the 
Rheinmetall Group."
"By creating its own energy supply from renewable sources and procuring energy from solar 
and wind power plants, the new unit will make an important contribution towards the Group’s carbon neutrality."
"Climate change 
The great tasks of today include containing climate change as far as possible and achieving an alignment to its 
consequences and impact."
"As a company with a sense of responsibility and with a global value added chain, 
Rheinmetall attaches great significance to this global challenge."
"The core of the matter is avoidance, reduction, 
substitution and compensation of the CO2 emissions produced by the Rheinmetall Group in Scopes 1, 2 and 3."
Rheinmetall’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets are based on the Paris Climate Agreement.
"For the year under review, we prepared a carbon footprint in accordance with the internationally recognized 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol for the second time."
It distinguishes between three categories of emissions.
"At our 
locations, direct emissions into the air (Scope 1) arise from the combustion of fossil energy sources, particularly 
natural gas."
"Indirect emissions (Scope 2) cover all emissions that are associated with purchased energy, such as 
electricity."
Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur in the value-added chain.
"In the eight upstream 
and seven downstream categories, these relate to the procurement of goods and services, manufacturing of 
products, production processes, and transport and logistics."
"Around 90% of carbon emissions at the Rheinmetall Group can be attributed to 
the top 20 companies alone."
"CO2e for fiscal 2023 was calculated using the location-based and market-based 
method."
"Scope 1 emissions for 2023 have been calculated using emission factors from the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change database."
"Scope 2 (location-based) emissions were calculated using emission factors 
from the International Energy Agency."
"Scope 2 (market-based) emissions were calculated based on availability 
using emission factors from energy suppliers at the location level."
"When this data is not available, the databases 
of the Association of Issuing Bodies, the International Energy Agency and the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency have been used."
"The emissions for refrigerants were calculated using the global warming 
potential in accordance with the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report."
The data in these two tables were determined on the basis of internal processes.
"They come from existing 
management systems and are based on meter readings or invoice amounts (if available in each case) and 
assumption-based projections by the companies."
"The data are requested in the operating units, collected with 
care and processed."
"Nevertheless, errors cannot be entirely ruled out in the collection, processing or transmission."
"In the reporting year, a review was carried out of the original intention to join the Science Based Targets Initiative 
(SBTi)."
In the first phase we refer to our own emissions (Scope 1) and energy supplier emissions (Scope 2).
"To do this the 
company will invest primarily in improving the energy efficiency of its locations and production facilities and 
develop and expand internal power generation from renewable sources."
"To this end, new photovoltaic systems 
were installed at locations in Spain, South Africa and Australia in the past fiscal year."
"In the medium to long term 
the CO2 emissions in Scope 3 are also to be reduced."
"This data will be audited for 
the first time in 2023 by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, Düsseldorf branch."
"The 
emissions attributable to the categories “Purchased goods and services” and “Use of products sold” accounted 
for over 90% of total Scope 3 emissions."
"Therefore, only these categories will be reported in 2023."
"The companies 
are accounted for using the operational control approach."
"All purchased goods and services in the fiscal year were 
assessed separately by product and supplier group using the corresponding exiobase (expenditure-based) 
emission factors."
"Emissions in “Use of products sold” were calculated using the emission factors of the Department for Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs and the Association of Issuing Bodies based on the German electricity mix."
"The lifetimes and 
operating times were assumed to depend on the end products."
"The share of emissions per Rheinmetall product 
was calculated as the relative share of emissions by weight of the intermediate product in relation to the total 
weight of the end product."
"The results will be taken into account in business continuity 
management, e.g."
"for the development of adequate and long-term protective measures as well as for preventive 
measures."
"The organization aims to establish the management of greenhouse 
gas emissions as a key economic success and risk factor in companies."
"Each year, on behalf of more than 500 
institutional investors, the CDP collects information on corporate strategies to combat climate change and 
company-specific greenhouse emissions."
"In the Climate Change Questionnaire, alongside questions on the 
organization, targets, projects and programs, companies are surveyed in respect to information about risks and 
opportunities of climate changes and measures in the area of climate protection."
"Rheinmetall again took part in 
the CDP’s demanding sustainability rating in the year under review and improved its score from “D” to “B,” which 
is above the industry average (score C)."
"TCFD 
The four-pillar framework of the TCFD of the G20 Financial Stability Board helps companies both in integrating the 
opportunities and mitigating the risks of climate change into their business and in reporting on them consistently."
Physical risks result from long-term changes of climatic and ecological conditions (e.g.
"increase in the sea level, 
temperature and change of climatic conditions) as well as through extreme individual weather events and their 
consequences."
"There are transition risks in connection with the move to a more economically sustainable 
economy with a lower carbon footprint, e.g."
"as a result of quickly implemented political measures on climate 
protection, due to technical progress or from changes in market sentiment and consumer preferences."
"In view of 
the mandatory CSRD reporting for our company from the 2024 fiscal year, which also covers the TCFD 
recommendations, we have decided not to include any additional voluntary reporting for the 2023 fiscal year."
"Waste management 
In all our production processes, we strive to be efficient in our use of materials."
"We prevent, reduce or recycle 
waste or dispose of it in a safe and environmentally friendly way."
"We aim to keep disposal quantities to as low a 
level as possible."
"Production- and material-related recycling takes place individually based on the requirements 
of the specific site."
"This entails waste separation, secure disposal methods and economically viable recycling 
processes."
"Waste quantities and recycling methods are also impacted by production quantities and renovation 
work in buildings and on business premises."
"The Group-wide waste volume of 60,417 tonnes in the reporting year, 
compared to 54,039 tonnes in the previous year, is the result of our increased business volume."
"Water is therefore becoming 
an increasingly scarce commodity."
"According to the UNESCO World Water Report, the consequences of climate 
change, population growth and rising consumption mean that more than five billion people will suffer from water 
shortages by 2050 if things continue as they are."
"Responsible use of water is an integral part of our commitment 
to sustainability."
"The water consumption of the Rheinmetall locations was 4,112,269 m³ in fiscal 2023 (previous year: 3,706,402 
m³)."
"Compared to the previous year, water purchases increased by around 11%."
"Influencing factors included a 
significant expansion in business activities, which resulted in higher water consumption."

"Conservation – encouraging biodiversity 
Our responsibility also includes preserving the diversity of natural habitats, especially for future generations."
"We 
are convinced that industrial use does not have to conflict with active conservation."
"On the contrary: For over a 
hundred years Rheinmetall has tested some of its military products on heathland near Unterlüss, not far from 
Celle, in Lower Saxony."
"Active landscaping and forestry management creates individual habitats for the unique fauna and 
flora."
"The result is an unusually rich array of flora, which in turn attracts a rare diversity of insects and birds and 
also provides a habitat for large wild animal populations."
"For biodiversity and climate protection, peatlands are very important."
"In September 2021, the Federal Ministry for 
the Environment published a National Peatland Strategy which includes voluntary rewetting measures."
"Wetlands 
and peatlands serve as the habitat for highly specialized animal and plant species whose alignment to the 
environment have made them rare and endangered."
"With their water absorption capacity, the moorlands fulfill 
important functions in regulating temperature and moisture."
"In fiscal 2022, a project analysis was carried out by 
an engineering firm on the company’s premises in Unterlüss to determine the basics, survey and sound the 
Kiehnmoor and determine the current water balance and peat thickness of the peatland."
"Based on this, the 
necessary measures were determined and a concept for possible rewetting was developed."
"An area of moorland 
in the immediate vicinity of the Kiehnmoor is also to be rewetted."
"In the year under review, exploratory talks were 
held with the owner of the Lower Saxony State Forests on possible cooperation with the aim of exploiting 
synergies, determining the advantages of simultaneous implementation and planning the involvement of affected 
neighbors."
"Other locations of Weapon and Ammunition in Germany and Switzerland also have extensive grounds with forests 
and green spaces."
"They therefore offer ideal conditions for continuous ecological upgrading and nature-oriented 
design."
"Following mapping and initial assessments, comprehensive concepts and action plans for the ecological 
optimization of the company premises were developed by specialist companies in the year under review."
"The implementation 
of the measures will be professionally monitored by external institutions, and the success of the measures will be 
documented and subjected to an independent performance review."
"Our South African subsidiary Rheinmetall Denel Munition is also engaged in protecting nature and species at risk 
of extinction at three of its four production sites."
"We develop partnerships locally to 
preserve these conservation areas along with their great biodiversity and rare species."
We provide information on relevant risks in the »Risks and opportunities section.
"Employees 
Management approach 
Rheinmetall’s success depends to a great extent on the ideas, expertise, motivation and commitment of its 
employees."
"The Rheinmetall Group is faced with increasingly tough competition from other companies to gain 
qualified personnel."
Acquiring skilled employees for the companies is therefore a key task in our HR work.
"In 
addition to performance-based remuneration and progressive benefits, we attach particular importance to having 
a wide spectrum of career opportunities on offer in the Rheinmetall Group companies."
"Further training, assuming 
responsibility and promotion opportunities have a high degree of relevance for the commitment and satisfaction 
of our employees."
"We offer interdisciplinary career paths, deployment opportunities to international locations, 
and tailored training opportunities for individual professional and personal development."
"A customer-focused 
corporate culture, based on the values of respect, trust and openness and in which the performance and 
commitment of each individual is appreciated, is a key requirement for being attractive as an employer."
"Developments on the labor markets 
The growing shortage of skilled personnel across all occupational groups and industries is slowing innovation, 
competitiveness and growth of companies."
"In times of weak birth cohorts, far-reaching and broad transformation 
of economic structures, globalization of markets and changes in the way age cohorts see themselves at work, 
competition for management, skilled and junior staff and experienced specialists will intensify further."
"Finding 
and retaining enough qualified and suitable employees will be one of the particular challenges of the coming 
years."
"In addition to our intensive activities in apprenticeship marketing, our existing marketing measures have been 
further strengthened at selected universities in the fields of engineering, electrical engineering and information 
technology."
"Personnel marketing measures have also been expanded to include additional communication 
channels."
"With a view to our key target groups of engineers, IT professionals and skilled workers, we drew attention 
to our company as an attractive employer by placing HR image ads in trade and quality media (digital and print)."
"Throughout Germany, we were also increasingly represented at HR, recruiting, and trade shows aimed at the 
professional groups of engineers, IT professionals and soldiers."
"Our presence on key job portals, professional 
social networks, and employer review platforms has also increased."
"In addition to traditional and modern means of recruitment, Rheinmetall also relies on its own training 
and development of junior employees and is also in close contact with universities, colleges and research 
institutes."
"This helps us to get to know suitable science, technology and business graduates at an early stage."
"The new, mobile-optimized careers website offers extensive information and insights into the Rheinmetall Group 
as an employer."
"The user-friendly “Careers worldwide” section presents career information from 20 countries in 
Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia."
"Potential applicants can also read brief descriptions 
of the different companies and the opportunity to view existing job advertisements quickly and easily."
"In 2023, 
our global careers website was visited around 5 million times, of which around 3.7 million were content pages and 
around 1.3 million were job advertisements (previous year: content pages 620,000 times)."
"The central Recruiting, Employer Branding and Diversity department is responsible for the internal and external 
recruiting of managers and employees (with the exception of contract workers) at Rheinmetall’s 40 sites 
throughout Germany and is responsible for end-to-end applicant management."
"Around 107,736 applications were 
registered on our TalentLink online platform in 2021 (previous year: 73,250)."
"In 2023, 4,185 positions (previous 
year: 3,189) were vacant at the German Rheinmetall companies."
"2,450 positions were filled by the end of 2023."
"In 
the past fiscal year, we recorded a total of 5,332 people joining and 4,058 people leaving the Rheinmetall Group 
(previous year: 4,946 and 2,853 respectively)."
"As they did in previous years, various institutes once again assessed the corporate image of German companies 
in 2023."
Rheinmetall was again selected as one of the 100 most attractive employers.
"In the trendence employer 
ranking, Rheinmetall was ranked 56th overall among engineering graduates."
"In the mechanical and plant 
engineering sector, Rheinmetall achieved 13th place and 4th place in the defence sector."
"In the Universum ranking (Germany Top 100 Ideal Employers) in the category of young engineering professionals, 
we ranked in 13th place in the year under review, after reaching 22nd place in the 2022 fiscal year."
"Rheinmetall 
was ranked 20th among engineering students."
"Rheinmetall was ranked 48th among IT students, an improvement 
of 41 places compared to the previous year."
"This highlights the positive perception of activities in business areas 
such as cyber security, software development and artificial intelligence."
"In natural sciences, we ranked among the 
top 100 employers in Germany, coming 49th (previous year: 96th)."
"In 2023, 770 trainees (previous year: 766) in Rheinmetall companies in Germany and abroad 
received vocational training, 415 of whom were based in Germany (previous year: 412)."
"In the year under review, 81% of the trainees in the Rheinmetall Group received training for industrial and technical 
occupations, and 19% received training for commercial occupations."
"The apprenticeship ratio was 3.2% of the 
workforce for the German locations (previous year: 3.3%) and 2.9% for the Rheinmetall Group as a whole (previous 
year: 3.1%)."
"The proportion of female trainees in the Rheinmetall Group was 14% (previous year: 12%), while the 
proportion in Germany reached 18% (previous year: 17%)."
"In 2023, 162 people in the Rheinmetall Group (previous 
year: 289) and 123 people (previous year: 171) at the Rheinmetall companies in Germany started their training, 
while 168 trainees (previous year: 153) took up temporary or permanent employment after successfully completing 
their training."
"Further training for employees – Further training, assuming responsibility and promotion opportunities have a high 
degree of relevance for the commitment and satisfaction of our employees."
"Thus strategic personnel planning is aligned to securing and continuously 
raising the high skill levels to ensure that the Group companies can achieve their business goals."
"Annual appraisal interviews between management and employees are deployed to talk about performance, 
targets and individual development options."
"A range of training opportunities are in place to support Rheinmetall 
employees with planning their own development, achieving individual learning objectives and expanding their 
skills to meet the requirements of their current positions or to obtain new positions."
"Personnel development and 
training activities are offered on the basis of regular needs assessments."
"Various sources are used for needs 
assessment."
"These include not only the results of the potential assessment and personnel development 
appraisals, which are conducted in accordance with the collective agreement on training, but also Group-wide 
successor planning, the target-setting process and capacity and investment planning."
"Further training objectives 
are also derived from strategic objectives, such as the increased internationalization of the Group and the 
transformation of the previous automotive supply business."
"Rheinmetall offers suitable talented people who have chosen one of the expert, project and management career 
paths individually tailored programs that promote the development of (junior) managers."
"In this way, top 
performers and employees with potential at the various career levels are successively prepared to take on 
positions in a management or expert function."
"The provision of personnel 
development and qualification measures is based on regular needs assessments."
The Rheinmetall Academy in Düsseldorf is the center for exchange and further training.
"It offers not only classroom 
training, but also blended learning and remote training."
"It forms the framework for personnel and management 
development and offers Group-wide training programs in the form of training courses, seminars and workshops 
for employees and managers."
"In addition to seminars and events with external trainers, in-house training and 
qualification measures are designed and carried out here that are specifically tailored to Rheinmetall’s needs."
"In the year under review, 3391 employees (2626 men, 765 women) attended 273 (previous year: 199) one-day or 
multi-day events at the Rheinmetall Academy, compared with 2,438 (1,883 men, 555 women) in the previous year."
"The proportion of female participants was around 23%, as in the previous year."
"Sixty-four percent of participants 
completed an online training course, and around 36% completed a face-to-face seminar."
"Modern remuneration systems 
Attractive, transparent remuneration is a key aspect in recruiting and retaining dedicated staff at the company."
Rheinmetall offers attractive contractual terms.
"These are based on the scope of tasks, responsibility and 
performance and are linked to market rates."
"In addition to fixed remuneration components, further salary 
components are paid."
Remuneration for managers and non-tariff B employees includes variable salary components.
"An individual 
variable portion of income is paid depending on the achievement of defined targets and the Group’s economic 
performance."
"Depending on the extent to which targets are achieved and the performance, this amounts to 
between 0% and 200% of variable target income."
"The fact that these income components are based on targets 
provides incentives for employees to act independently and to take on challenges."
Executives receive a long-term incentive (LTI) in addition to the short-term component.
"This is geared towards long-
term corporate success and for 2023 includes payment of 40% of the long-term incentive amount in Rheinmetall 
shares, which are subject to a four-year lock-up period."
"The number of shares granted is based on a reference 
share price, which corresponds to the average price on the last five trading days in February of the subsequent 
fiscal year."
"To bring the interests and targets of management and stakeholders into 
alignment, non-financial targets have been taken into account in Executive Board remuneration."
"The company’s success is also reflected for employees in Germany covered by collective wage agreements in two 
ways: firstly, an additional bonus is paid to employees covered by collective wage agreements depending on the 
consolidated operating profit."
"Secondly, an employer-financed, performance-related supplementary pension is 
paid into the company pension scheme, which leads to improved security in old age."
"The prestigious German company pension award, which was presented for the tenth time in 2023, is regarded by 
experts as the most important award for company pension schemes."
"The award recognizes companies that 
develop particularly forward-looking occupational pension concepts."
"In April 2023, Rheinmetall impressed the 
jury with “Rheinmetall Plus 2.0,” a modern, high-performance and flexible occupational pension plan for all 
employees, for which it was awarded second place in the “Large companies” category."
"The 30% employer allowance, which amounted to 
€3.7 million (previous year: €3 million), enables employees to acquire shares at attractive conditions subject to a 
two-year holding period and participate as part-owners in the business success of their company."
"For us diversity is a key value, and in times of transformation 
a major factor for innovation and steady growth."
"We value all people regardless of gender, age, sexual identity, 
educational background, state of health, ethical or social background, skin color, religion, culture, ideology or 
other personal characteristics."
"For us it is important to create a secure and integrative working environment, one 
marked by respect, in which each person is equal, treated fairly and can maximize his or her potential."
"The corporate philosophy, the Code of Conduct, the principles of social responsibility and the Diversity Policy 
establish the framework for promoting diversity and equal opportunity as well as acting against discrimination."
"By 
signing the Diversity Charter, we are underlining this stance and making it clear to the public as well."
"At the end of fiscal 2023, 881 employees at our German 
companies were foreign nationals (previous year: 858)."
"We attach importance to the fact that this internationality is evident not only in the workforce but also at 
management level."
"Where possible, local talent is used when filling management positions outside Germany."
"We 
encourage our workforce to network within the company and to move to another unit or site."
"In the year under 
review, 69 German employees (previous year: 61) used the ex-pat program, strengthening international 
cooperation and supporting the willingness of employees in other countries to make an internal move."
Around 21% of employees were female in the year under review (previous year: 21%).
"Generally, the security and defence as well as automotive sectors are preferred 
by men, who predominantly tend to choose technical or scientific subjects for study and professional training."
"In 
the year under review, the proportion of female applicants is naturally relatively low at 16%."
"Gradually increasing the share of woman among the high potentials will result in increasing 
the proportion of women in management positions, without specifying a fixed ratio for the share of women."
"Female 
young potentials are encouraged in a targeted fashion, and are supported in setting ambitious professional 
objectives and to continue pursuing them across any family phases."
"Here Rheinmetall is accommodating with 
family-friendly work conditions."
"In the past fiscal year, the share of women in the national and international Young 
Manager Program was 24% and 33% respectively, and 19% and 29% in the two Manager Leadership Programs."
"The international community of female employees at Rheinmetall is organized under the women@Rheinmetall 
network."
"The platform offers its over 730 members from more than 19 countries a forum for transferring knowledge, 
exchanging experience and providing advice and support in professional matters, including through training and 
virtual Talk & Learn events."
"The Talk & Thrive mentoring program, which has been running since 2022, also brings 
together experienced female colleagues as mentors and interested mentees."
"Management functions across the Rheinmetall Group are classified on a hierarchical basis into eight management 
levels which correlate to the five management clusters."
"Determining factors for classifying a job to a management 
cluster include the level of operating, professional and management responsibility."
"In the year under review, 424 
persons (previous year: 441) were assigned to the upper three management clusters, including 51 women (12%) 
(previous year: 50; 11.3%)."

Rheinmetall was ranked 17th in the German Diversity Index 2023."
"The German Diversity Index evaluates diversity 
on the management boards of DAX 40 companies and assesses their commitment to diversity as documented in 
public reports."
"Inclusion 
Our open corporate culture ensures that employees with health problems or disabilities are fully integrated in 
working life at Rheinmetall, where they have every opportunity to bring their talents and skills to the table and 
prove what they can do."
"Once again, the focus here is on developing existing strengths and potential."
"It is vital 
here that workstations are individually adapted to the type and degree of disability, enabling (further) employment 
with physical disabilities or easing reintegration into normal working life."
"In the year under review, the German-
based Rheinmetall Group companies employed 613 severely disabled people (previous year: 644), who are 
represented by the Group representative body for severely disabled employees."
"In September 2023, the inclusion agreement, which expired in August 2023 and is seen by the signatory parties 
as an opportunity to improve the professional inclusion of people with disabilities, was revised with a term until 
December 2025."
"The age groups of 25- to 40-year-olds and 40- to 55-year-olds were the two largest groups at Rheinmetall in the 
year under review, accounting for a total of 76%."
"The over 55s make up 20%, while 4% of Rheinmetall employees 
are under 25."
"For this reason, the Diversity Day in May 2023, under the heading “Generations@Work,” focused for 
the first time on cross-generational cooperation and communication."
"The further development of understanding 
between the generations and the emphasis on opportunities for joint and cross-generational working and learning 
play an important role."
"On the basis of detailed structural analyses and simulation calculations, interdisciplinary teams are developing 
new HR programs which factor in the different initial situations and developments at the national and international 
sites and their impact on the employee age structure."
"The average age of employees (excluding trainees and interns) in the Rheinmetall Group was 42.9 (previous year: 
43.3)."
"In 2023, the average age in the German companies was 43.9 (previous year: 44.3); in the companies outside 
Germany, it was 41.9 (previous year: 42.3)."
"On average, 
employees in the Rheinmetall companies outside Germany had worked at the company for 8.3 years (previous 
year: 9.4), while those in the German companies averaged 11.6 years (previous year: 12.6)."
"Occupational safety and health management 
Rheinmetall is aware of its responsibility toward its employees and strives to ensure that the working environment 
is safe, healthy and clean."
"The Group ensures occupational and health protection at the workplace within the 
context of the national provisions in place at its various locations."
"Workplaces are designed in accordance with 
the legally and generally recognized safety and industrial medicine regulations, thereby allowing everyone to 
perform their work without incident and without being subjected to undue stress and strain."
"The importance of occupational safety for Rheinmetall is emphasised by the inclusion of the Lost Time Incident 
Rate (LTIR) in the remuneration of Executive Board members since 2022."
"From 2024, this key figure will also be 
included in the remuneration of managers."
"Each and every employee of the Rheinmetall Group is obligated to familiarize themselves with all the relevant 
safety regulations and to observe these in their own working area diligently and at all times – in the interests of 
not only themselves, but also the company as a whole."
"Rheinmetall is committed to minimizing to the greatest 
extent possible all risks and hazards that could potentially endanger the health and safety of employees and third 
parties."
"Through continuous improvements in the workplace environment, suitable measures (e.g."
"ergonomic aids 
and protective equipment) and a broad range of prevention programs and health-promoting measures, 
Rheinmetall seeks to maintain and promote the health, performance and satisfaction of its employees."
"During the course of the year, employees benefit from not only medical checkups but also a range of prevention 
programs."
"The spectrum includes everything from free vaccinations and regular health checkups, through internal 
and external sporting opportunities and consulting services, to medically appropriate reintegration following a 
period of long illness."
"In the fast-moving and complex working world of a technology group, economic success depends heavily on the 
human factor."
"One of the challenges of health management is to improve the well-being, adaptability and 
resilience of our employees."
"With the “Think Healthy Committee” we are focusing even more strongly on promoting 
the health of our employees, creating a Groupwide platform through which the existing activities of our companies 
in Germany and abroad can be bundled and managed throughout the Group."
"The Global Health Manager works 
together with the divisional health coordinators, who are particularly responsible for regulating supraregional 
issues, and the local health coordinators, who are in turn organized into local steering committees."
"The aim is to 
create uniform structures, actively manage the implementation of targeted measures, create a common 
understanding of healthy leadership, and support health-promoting action."
"Based on this, fields of action are 
continuously identified and measures defined."
"This workshop planned the focal points of the joint work for the 2024 
fiscal year."
"Another building block in our approach to further promoting safety and health is the commitment of the operating 
units to demonstrate an externally certified management system in accordance with ISO 45001 by the end of 2024."
"The prestigious Corporate Health Award, which was presented for the 15th time in December 2023, honors 
organizations with outstanding occupational health management with 20 industry awards and ten special prizes."
"The prize is jointly awarded by the Bonn-based consulting and market research institute EuPD Research 
Sustainable Management and Handelsblatt."
"Out of 250 participants from 15 sectors, Rheinmetall was awarded 
first place in the “Production/Processing Industry” segment."
"In the year under review, the sickness rate at the German Rheinmetall companies was 5.4% (previous year: 4.6%)."
"The accident frequency rate (number of accidents per 1 million working hours) calculated for the Rheinmetall Group 
for fiscal year 2023 was 5.8 (previous year: 6.1)."
"A total of two workplace accidents resulting in fatalities occurred 
at the Neckarsulm and Boksburg, South Africa, sites."
"Work–life balance 
Career success depends, among other things, on how content an employee is outside of their working hours."
"Many 
employees want to take greater account of individual life stages and specific life situations in their working life 
and wish to create a healthier balance between their professional goals and their family and private interests 
through more flexible working hours."
"For us, it is important to support our employees with a family-friendly HR 
policy."
"We also provide a family service throughout Germany to support employees in matters concerning career and 
children/care through advice and assistance."
"In 2023, 165 employees (previous year: 172) were on parental leave 
in the German companies (109 female employees, 56 male employees; previous year: 118 female employees, 54 
male employees)."
"In the year under review, the opportunity to be temporarily released from work, either fully or 
partly, to care for close relatives was taken up by two employees."
"Constructive dialogue for fair working conditions 
Corporate co-determination is a long-standing tradition at Rheinmetall."
"We strive to treat each other fairly and to 
achieve a trustful and constructive exchange of views with employee representatives in Germany and abroad in 
order to reconcile the interests of the company and the needs of employees."
Co-determination in Germany is based on local works councils and general works councils.
"Topics that are to be 
regulated uniformly for all Group companies in Germany are discussed with the German Group Works Council."
"We 
also keep the Economic Committees of our German Group companies and the German Group Works Council 
regularly informed about the economic situation and changes within the Rheinmetall Group."
"Another important partner is the European Works Council, which looks after the rights of our European employees 
to information, consultation and advice in the case of cross-border European issues."
"Accordingly, within the framework of freedom of association and the respective national regulations, we respect 
the fundamental right of our employees to form, join and be represented by trade unions."
"In the Supervisory Board of Rheinmetall AG, which is based on joint representation, the employees of our German 
companies are also represented by two elected trade union representatives, five elected employee representatives 
and one elected representative of the managerial staff."
"In addition, elected employee representatives are 
represented on the existing other Supervisory Boards of our German Group companies."

"Procurement and the supply chain 
Management approach 
Management approach The quality of our products is significantly affected by the quality of the raw materials, 
parts and components supplied."
"We expect a high quality assured by internationally recognized standards such 
as ISO 9001, IATF 16949 and AQAP 2110/2210 from our suppliers."
"They are selected on the basis of the quality, 
reliability, performance, suitability and price of the products or services offered."
"ESG criteria are also integrated in 
the selection process and taken into account when reviewing business partners."
"Transparency in the supply chain 
We procure goods and services from countries all over the world to manufacture our products."
"Due to the extensive 
and highly diverse product portfolio, some of the supply chains of the Rheinmetall Group are extremely complex, 
globally fragmented and also subject to constant change."
"In a company that has international production plants 
and sales activities, upholding environmental and human rights due diligence obligations is a major challenge 
connected with a significant responsibility."
"A growing number of national and supranational laws and regulations govern the assumption of responsibility in 
global supply chains."
"The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which particularly obliges companies to 
monitor their suppliers with regard to compliance with internationally recognized human rights and environmental 
concerns and to ensure lawful dealings with partners throughout the entire supplier relationship."
"The law is to be 
applied from January 1, 2023 for companies based in Germany with more than 3,000 employees."
"The processes of the newly established risk management system for suppliers were implemented in the year under 
review."
"Together with the realigned governance, these processes serve to fulfill and document the requirements 
of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act in the area of purchasing."
"The risk management system for suppliers is managed by the “ESG Supply Chain” unit, which was established in 
2023 as part of the cross-divisional purchasing organization."
"This ensures that Rheinmetall implements and fulfills 
the due diligence obligations uniformly throughout the Group."
"To do this, we use 
the methodology stored in the web-based platform of the internationally renowned service provider EcoVadis."
"The ESG rating is based on a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) tailored to the respective supplier regarding 
three risk aspects (company size, industry/sector, purchasing parameters), the review of submitted verification 
documents, and the evaluation of information from external sources."
"EcoVadis checks the individual aspects 
included in a total of 21 indicators in the areas of environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable 
procurement."
"In the process we want to increase not only the transparency of the sustainability performance of 
the individual suppliers, but also achieve more targeted management of the risks and opportunities in relation to 
sustainability in our supply chains."
"In this way, suppliers 
which represent a risk can be identified more quickly and more reliably."
"Any identified gaps or risk aspects are 
then transferred into corresponding risk-mitigating action plans."
"The aim of all measures is to initiate actual 
changes for the better in our suppliers’ environmental, social, labor and governance standards."
"In the second phase, these identified suppliers were either requested to submit their EcoVadis 
scorecard or were asked to submit an SAQ."
"The evaluation of the scorecards shared with us by the end of 2023 
shows that, according to the EcoVadis methodology, around 60% of these suppliers have a sustainability 
performance rated “Good” (score 45-64) by EcoVadis."
"Only 1% of suppliers were classified as “critical” and were 
analyzed individually."
"In line with the risk-based approach, those critical suppliers who have rejected an EcoVadis 
assessment or whose assessment has expired are urged to renew the assessment or participate in the rating."
"If 
necessary, an individual ESG supplier audit is carried out."
"The central Compliance Due Diligence center of expertise also conducts business partner reviews for new and 
existing suppliers using defined criteria and value thresholds, which also include ESG aspects such as human 
rights and environmental factors."
"In the event of any anomalies, the central area Corporate Social Responsibility 
is informed and then, in conjunction with the specialist departments in question, checks and clarifies the issue 
identified."
"We expect our suppliers to take into account the principles laid 
down in our Supplier Code of Conduct – which is available in several languages and is valid worldwide – in their 
own corporate policies and to view them as an advantageous basis for further business relationships."
"In October 2022, the completely revised Supplier Code of Conduct 2.0, which is aligned with the requirements of 
the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, was published as a binding component of contracts with suppliers."
"On this basis, Rheinmetall can now act more proactively in partnership with its supplier partners to improve 
performance, sustainability and compliance aspects in the procurement process and to achieve corporate 
development goals at the economic, social, ecological and regulatory levels."
"Supply chains in the automotive industry 
The automotive industry consists of a complex network of globally active players."
"A distinction is made between 
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), first-tier suppliers and second- and third-tier suppliers."
"Manufacturers 
and suppliers are closely linked in working together to develop and produce vehicles."
"Automotive manufacturers 
have been working for some time on anchoring economic, ecological and social objectives vertically, i.e."
"across 
all stages of the value-added chain."
"These include respect of international ESG standards and ESG frameworks, 
reduction of carbon footprint in production, a higher proportion of recyclable material, responsible use of 
substances and materials, and future carbon-neutral products."
as part of supplier questionnaires.
"With the larger share of their product spectrum, Sensors and 
Actuators and Materials and Trade hold a first-tier position in the value-added chain of automotive production, i.e."
we supply automotive manufacturers and suppliers.
"The automotive manufacturers BMW Group, Daimler Truck, Ferrari, Ford, Geely, GWM, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover, 
Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Scania, Toyota Motor Europe, Volkswagen Group, Volta Trucks, Volvo Cars and Volvo 
Group are automotive partners of Drive Sustainability (as of November 21, 2023)."
"These OEMS regularly ask their 
suppliers to submit a self-disclosure on ESG aspects (Sustainability Assessment Questionnaire, SAQ) via the NQC 
platform, which allows performance and progress to be analyzed and evaluated and the degree of compliance 
with their requirements to be determined."
"In the year under review, Sensor and Actuators achieved a median score 
of 90/100 points with the companies assigned to it, while the average score of the companies belonging to 
Materials and Trade was 84/100 points."
"Supply chains in the security and defence industry 
Supply chains in the defence industry are characterized by very complex structures, easily comprising up to eight 
stages for the needs of, for example, Rheinmetall Waffe Munition and Rheinmetall Landsysteme."
"In the defence technology 
industry, switching to new suppliers is very costly, both from a financial and time-related perspective."
"The 
qualification of products carried out by military authorities is linked not only to the performance of the product 
itself but also to the manufacturing process, manufacturing location and suppliers."
"A change of suppliers therefore 
automatically results in costs for requalification."
"The procurement business in the area of ballistic protection has 
the characteristics of a project, i.e."
it is characterized by intermittent production by our suppliers.
"This requires a 
high number of quality assurance measures."
"Furthermore, specific legislation, such as the War Weapons Control 
Act, the Foreign Trade and Payments Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), to cite just a few, 
must be taken into consideration for procurement in the divisions operating in the security technology sector."
We provide information on relevant risks in the »Risks and opportunities section.
"Social responsibility 
Management approach 
Social acceptance is an important requirement for companies’ economic success."
"Many Rheinmetall companies 
can look back on a long history."
"They have been connected with their sites for many years and are strongly rooted 
in the local community – after all, this is where their employees and business partners live."
"In some cases, major 
customers are based there."
"Rheinmetall is a living, breathing part of society and participates actively in it and not 
just in a financial sense."
"We get involved in the areas of education, sport and culture and also provide direct 
support for local social projects and charitable organizations."
"By adding value locally, we also contribute to 
regional development."
"Flourishing production sites do not only mean attractive, highly skilled jobs and training 
places close to home but also orders for local suppliers and service providers."
"In addition, a large part of the sales 
generated by the companies returns to the respective economies via the employees, public sector and the 
shareholders."
Capital expenditure in future growth is financed via the funds remaining in the Rheinmetall Group.
"Social engagement is a long-standing tradition at 
Rheinmetall."
It always goes beyond the plant boundaries.
"Since the needs and opportunities in the vicinity of the 
locations where we operate vary greatly, the decision on which local project to support is incumbent on the 
respective management teams of the companies, the division heads or the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG."
"The cooperation between Rheinmetall and the sports city of 
Düsseldorf includes sports sponsorship of a handball league team."
"However, parts of the package also focus on 
promoting Olympic, youth and amateur sports as well as new trend sports."
"In January 2023, we expanded our 
involvement in top-class and popular sport to include a well-known team from the Düsseldorf region."
"In 
cooperation with D.SPORTS, Rheinmetall will sponsor Borussia Düsseldorf’s professional table tennis team as part 
of its regional sports promotion program."
"In the cultural sector, we supported the Düsseldorf Festival in September 2023 as we have in previous years, which 
put the city at the center of the dance, theater, new circus and music scene for a month."
"Product responsibility 
Specialist working groups in the divisions deal, for example, with safety and environmental standards for 
Rheinmetall products."
"They are responsible for tracking new regulations and developments, defining and 
implementing the required internal processes and conducting relevant training."
"Products in civilian business are 
subjected to extensive testing in accordance with the regulations prescribed by automotive quality and 
development standards."
"Sensors and Actuators, for example, uses a database-supported process for product 
safety management, which maps out the entire product lifecycle."
"Materials and Trade uses special design and 
simulation tools."
"To prove product safety, in addition to tests carried out in testing facilities outside the engine, 
engine operation tests are also carried out with customers under various stress scenarios."
"Internal and external 
audits are carried out to regularly monitor compliance with the parameters of the quality management system and 
the relevant processes."
"For the divisions operating in the field of security technology, the guideline for 
implementing product safety sets out the basic requirements for ensuring the safety of Defence products in line 
with common standards and methods."
"The R&D Internal Funds team and the Protection Systems business unit worked on further development of the 
Digital Product Passport (DPP) in the year under review."
"The DPP is intended in particular to drive forward the 
circular economy and enable new digital business models."
"For example, information on components, materials, 
repairability and reuse, as well as usage data, is stored individually for each product in digital form."
"Key players 
along the value and supply chain can access this data via a unique identifier and decide how a used product can 
be optimally fed into further value creation from an economic and ecological perspective (repair, reuse, recycle, 
etc.)."
Rheinmetall has been actively involved in an initiative of the European Defence Agency (EDA) on this topic.
"As part of the “Incubation Forum for Circular Economy in European Defence – IFCEED,” Rheinmetall is participating 
in studies on the digital product passport in the defence sector."
"The development of environmentally friendly solutions for materials is not only being driven forward in the civilian 
sector of our business activities, such as in Materials and Trade as part of the substitution of lead-containing 
materials."
"Defence is also working on the materials portfolio to identify suitable alternatives to chromium-
containing coatings for individual parts, for example."
"In the year under review, Material and Trades launched a 
project to replace lead with a lead-free alternative material."
"Human rights due diligence obligations 
Protecting human rights in our own company and in the supply chain is an important priority of Rheinmetall."
"Within its own sphere of influence, Rheinmetall supports the protection of internationally recognized human 
rights."
"We also appeal to all our business partners, and in particular our suppliers, to follow our social principles."
"Our 
expectations of this stakeholder group are described in the Supplier Code of Conduct 2.0 published in October 
2022."
"The 
procedure for assessing the sustainability performance of suppliers is explained in more detail in the 
»Procurement and supply chain section."
"Complaints and reports of suspected or actual human rights violations can be submitted externally through a 
variety of communication channels."
Points of contact are also already established in the companies/locations.
"The Incident Management unit, which is part of the Compliance Operations function, ensures that these reported 
incidents are looked into in a structured and unbiased manner, paying particular attention to protecting the 
identities of the whistleblowers."
"In April 2021, Rheinmetall joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)."
"This is a multi-stakeholder forum for 
the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices."
"As a signatory, we are 
committed to promoting compliance with the UNGC’s ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human 
rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption."
"Furthermore, we are involved in the CSR/human 
rights working group of the German Institute for Compliance."
"Representatives of our company chair the “Corporate 
Responsibility” and “REACH” working groups of the Federal Association of the German Security and Defence 
Industry."
"We also continue to be active in the “Sustainability in the Supply Chain” working group of the German 
Association of the Automotive Industry."
"In line with our values and our Code 
of Conduct, we are committed to conduct characterized by responsibility, integrity, respect and fairness."
"We are 
an honest, loyal and reliable partner for all our stakeholders."
Our binding compliance policy serves to safeguard our business success on a lasting basis.
"We do not tolerate any damage to our company’s 
standing and to the reputation of our employees or agents as a result of unlawful and/or unethical behavior or 
corrupt business practices."

"Sustainable finance 
Sustainable finance means taking account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations when 
making investment decisions in the finance sector, which should lead to longer-term investments in sustainable 
economic activities and projects."
"In addition to climate change mitigation, the ecological aspects also include 
adapting to climate change and environmental factors such as preserving biodiversity, avoiding pollution, and the 
circular economy."
"Social parameters may, for example, relate to issues of inequality, working conditions, 
investments in local communities, and human rights."
"One important measure of the European Union was therefore the definition of the EU Taxonomy, which is intended 
to establish a shared understanding of the environmental sustainability of economic activities and capital 
expenditure."
"The EU 
Taxonomy distinguishes between taxonomy-eligible economic activities, which correspond to the pure description 
of a category and thus do not have any significance to sustainability."
"All corporate activities that cannot be assigned 
to any category are taxonomy-non-eligible."
"Based on these complex screening criteria, the extent to which products and individual measures are ecologically 
sustainable as defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation is specified."
"Method of determination 
The recording of taxonomy-relevant economic activities was carried out using a decentralized top-down approach."
"As part of 
this, the determination was divided into three phases: identification of relevant category sets, allocation of 
economic activities (taxonomy eligibility) and taxonomy alignment testing."
The categories were identified for all six environmental objectives.
"On this basis, the 
relevant categories with the associated criteria sets were identified and all non-applicable categories were 
excluded."
"For environmental objective (2) climate change adaptation, no economic activity was identified in the 
“allocation of economic activities” phase."
"As in previous years, this was therefore not taken into account."
"In the Annexes to Environmental Objectives 3-6 of the Delegated Regulation, there were also some changes to the 
wording regarding compliance with the NACE codes, which stipulate a stricter interpretation."
"Wording (b), on the other hand, can be understood as a mandatory formulation, 
meaning that economic activities that cannot be assigned to the NACE codes mentioned are considered non-
taxonomy-eligible."
"Derived from this, the assignment of the category sets first identified the sales-
generating economic activities and the associated capital and operating expenditure."
"In addition, any values that 
did not generate sales in the reporting period but could be assigned to categories (B) or (C) were identified."
"In a second step, the sets of categories were applied to the economic activities of the divisions."
"To gain an initial 
estimate of the taxonomy eligibility in 2023, the expected annual values were also added."
"In addition, these were 
used to determine an internal materiality limit, as the granularity in the determination made possible by the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation, in particular for (C) capital expenditure, cannot yet be fully technically implemented."
"The 
materiality limit for comparability is based on the methodology of previous years, which is approximately 1/1000 
of the taxonomy-eligible totals of sales, operating expenditure and investments less special effects."
"Special 
effects are business activities that are not part of the company’s core business, are non-recurring in nature and 
have a significant impact on earnings."
"These include, for example, the one-off purchase of buildings by 
Rheinmetall Immobilien Gesellschaft for rental or resale."
"No significant deviations in the projected annual value 
were identified by the materiality limit."
"In the third phase, the determined economic activities of Rheinmetall AG were finally checked for their taxonomy 
alignment."
"A distinction was made between (1) requirements to be examined for each individual economic activity 
itself, such as the substantial contribution and specific DNSH criteria, (2) requirements relating to the locations 
and (3) requirements covered by Group-wide compliance."
"The latter particularly applies to the requirements of the 
minimum safeguards."
"Due to the full reporting obligation for taxonomy eligibility and alignment for all environmental 
objectives, taxonomy alignment is expected to increase again from the 2024 fiscal year."
"With the results, the KPIs of the EU Taxonomy Regulation have been conclusively evaluated for the Rheinmetall 
Group."

"2.1.1 Environmental objective 1: Climate change mitigation 
Manufacture of renewable energy technologies (3.1.) 
This category refers to renewable energies within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001."
"With the 
manufacture of bushes for brakes and geared rotor shafts of wind turbines, KS Gleitlager GmbH from Materials 
and Trade contributes significantly to the further development of wind power technologies."
"In terms of the 
regulation, we classify this as an enabling activity."
"The requirements of the selected category for taxonomy 
eligibility are thus fulfilled according to our interpretation."
"In this respect, it is our 
understanding that no separate proof is required for this if taxonomy eligibility has already been proven."
"The substantial contribution for the manufacture of technologies 
for the use of hydrogen does not deviate from the requirements for taxonomy eligibility."
"In this respect, no separate 
verification was required."
"In our understanding, 
vehicles are all vehicles that serve to transport persons or objects and participate in traffic on the road."
Participation in traffic on the road involves a certain regularity from our point of view.
"As in the 2022 fiscal year, 
the logistical military vehicles and special vehicles for the civilian sector are therefore reported as taxonomy-
eligible in this category in accordance with our interpretation."
"Due to requirements (h) and (i) of the substantial 
contribution, a further investigation into taxonomy alignment has not been undertaken, as the relevant products 
do not currently meet the requirements."
"Manufacture of energy-efficient building equipment (3.5.) 
Pierburg GmbH received an order for the delivery of a refrigerant compressor model with DC electronics in 
December 2022."
"The sales generated for the development services and the associated investments and operating 
expenses in 2023 are reported as taxonomy-aligned in this category."
"As a supplier of relevant components, we 
have the role of the enabling company."
"To meet the substantial contribution (k), the technical screening criteria in 
Section 4.16 of (EU) 2021/2800 Annex 1 must be met."
"However, these refer to the final product itself, which is why 
we have limited ourselves to the fulfillment of the technical screening criteria of category 3.5."
"Compliance with 
Article 3 letters b and c of (EU) 2020/852 is presented separately."
"Manufacture of other low carbon technologies (3.6.) 
During the period under review, Rheinmetall Electronics GmbH made a significant contribution to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by providing individually manufactured simulators as an alternative to the use of 
vehicles."
These are simulators for specific vehicles that are ordered by the customer instead of training vehicles.
"Standard simulators designed for multiple vehicles were not included, as in this case the comparative solution 
would have been another simulator."
"In the case of standard simulators, verification of greenhouse gas savings is 
not possible."
"Manufacture of automotive and mobility components (3.18) 
The majority of the taxonomy-eligible products of Pierburg GmbH and Pierburg Pump Technology GmbH relate to 
the automotive industry."
"Last year, category 3.6 was applicable for activities in the automotive supplier industry 
on the basis of the EU Commission’s FAQ from February 2022."
"With the reintroduction of category 3.18 by the EU 
Commission in June 2023, the components are now taken into account accordingly."
"While in the previous year, 
components of a hybrid vehicle could also be considered under category 3.6 if their target technology is the electric 
part of the drivetrain, these are not applicable this year due to the restriction to zero-emission vehicles in category 
3.18."
"Due to the fact that this 
category is an addition published in June 2023, the economic activities in this category are reported as taxonomy-
eligible in their entirety."
"Manufacture of aircraft (3.21) 
Rheinmetall Aviation Services generates sales from the manufacture, maintenance, repair and technical support 
of drones."
The EU Commission defines drones as all aircraft that can fly without a pilot on board.
Rheinmetall Aviation Services is also investing in the future production of military combat aircraft this year.
"Construction of new buildings (7.1.) 
All new construction activities of the Rheinmetall Group have been allocated to the “Construction of new 
buildings” criteria set."
"This involves the implementation of construction projects for residential and non-
residential buildings for the Group’s own account for resale or on a fee or contract basis."
"For construction of new 
buildings, comprehensive climate protection requirements must be taken into account for building permits in 
accordance with statutory regulations."
"Rheinmetall Immobilien Gesellschaft mbH is also committed to more far-
reaching ecological and economic measures in several projects."
"For example, certifications in accordance with the 
German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB) – which go beyond the legally required minimum requirements 
through strict specifications and test criteria – serve as a benchmark."
"In Düsseldorf, Rheinmetall Immobilien 
Gesellschaft mbH is implementing a new construction project named “Stadtgärten Unterrath” with approximately 
30 condominiums for sale."
The building will be constructed in accordance with the KfW 55 standard.
"It can be 
assumed that the requirements for the KfW 55 standard do not meet the required criteria of the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation."
"Acquisition of and ownership of buildings (7.7.) 
Activities in the field of acquisition and management of property in buildings fall under Category 7.7 of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation."
"Here, in particular, sales from the rental of buildings or the purchase of a property are to be 
recognized as taxonomy-eligible."
The construction of new buildings for own use should also be included here.
"The 
majority of the economic activities assigned to this category do not meet the criteria for a significant contribution."
"In Düsseldorf, however, Rheinmetall Immobilien Gesellschaft mbH generates taxonomy-aligned sales from the 
rental of the DeltaD office building."
"As this was built in accordance with the DGNB Gold standard, it can be 
assumed that the building meets the criteria for the significant contribution."
"2.1.2 Environmental objective 4: Circular economy 
Depollution and dismantling of end-of-life products (2.6) 
Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH carries out various projects to extend the useful life of tactical vehicles."
"This 
involves completely dismantling old vehicles down to the vehicle hull and refurbishing or modernizing them."
"In 
some cases, pollutants are also removed during dismantling."
"This is done by completely stripping the paint from 
the vehicles."
"This involves removing the chromium VI-containing primers used until 2010, which are harmful to 
health."
"All economic activities in which both dismantling and the removal of harmful substances, such as 
complete paint stripping, are carried out are considered taxonomy-compliant."
"Preparation for reuse of end-of-life products and product components (5.3) 
This category includes the preparation for reuse of end-of-life products and product components at the end of their 
service life."
MS Motorservice France S.
"(MSF) procures end-of-life turbochargers, reconditions them and sells 
them as refurbished."
"Without the reconditioning described above, the turbochargers would either be partially 
recycled or disposed of as waste and would therefore be at the end of their service life."
"As part of the reconditioning 
process, they are prepared so that they can be reused in a vehicle without further processing."
"The sales associated 
with the described activity are therefore to be regarded as taxonomy-compliant in the present category."
"2.2 Do no significant harm to any of the environmental objectives (DNSH) 
This approach can essentially be divided into three phases: centralized evaluation, location-specific verification 
and individual consideration."
The survey on the requirements of these annexes was prepared centrally.
"After verification and any necessary adjustments as well as documentation 
of evidence, this package was merged centrally."
"Appendix (C) “Generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention 
and control regarding use and presence of chemicals” required a more comprehensive consideration and 
interpretation."
"In this context, the terms “production,” “placing on the market” and “use” were defined as follows:  
 
Production: A harmful substance is produced for the first time in one’s own company."
"This does not yet 
include an external effect."
" 
Placing on the market: The harmful substance is introduced onto the market for the first time by the own 
company and thus has an external effect."
" 
Use: A harmful substance or a product containing the harmful substance is introduced into a product by the 
company for the first time in production, manufacturing or assembly."
"It should be noted that traceability 
over several stages of the value chain cannot currently be guaranteed."
"With this determination, the examination of the requirements of appendix (C) was handed over to the divisions 
and examined there for each individual taxonomy asset."
"The result was then made available again centrally, added 
to the package for evaluation of the DNSH criteria and thus ended the review process."
"Corruption and bribery 
4."
"Fair competition  
 
For each of these topics, a proposal for the implementation of the criteria is explained, which can be followed until 
the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive (CSRD) has been transposed into German law."
"For each of these 
topics, a proposal for the implementation of the criteria is explained in a single chapter."
"The criteria mentioned 
are also presented in an overview table, which formed the basis for the evaluation within the Group."
"A document 
was created to review the criteria for Rheinmetall AG, in which the information in the table was adopted and 
responsibilities from the HR, Compliance, Legal and CSR departments were initially assigned for the various 
criteria."
The type of evidence for each criterion was also noted in the document.
"The amendments to the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises were also taken into account in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Furthermore, since 2022 the 
Compliance department has been using the “Ethical” tool, which carries out surveys on various compliance topics 
every two months for all Rheinmetall AG companies."
"Extracts from the results of these surveys were also used as 
evidence."
"The activities aimed at generating sales – regardless 
of whether sales, capital expenditures or operating expenditures were concerned – were examined for possible 
double-counting effects, as there is a risk of this with regard to internal value added in particular."
"This approach 
has eliminated existing uncertainties."
"In the case of manufacturing overheads, procedures were applied that 
assumed an interdependence between sales and operating costs of the respective product."
"It was not possible to 
break down the overhead costs separately."
"However, this procedure ensured that there was no double counting."
"Activities that pursue a goal other than generating sales – particularly energy-related measures– were analyzed 
on the basis of itemizations."
This did not reveal any anomalies.
"Result 
The consolidated financial statements of Rheinmetall AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations 
of section 315e(1) German Commercial Code (“HGB”) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union (EU)."
"Further information on the accounting standards can be found in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements under “Summary of accounting standards.” In its core indicators, 
the EU Taxonomy Regulation distinguishes between sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure."
"Here, 
the respective main unit, the denominator, is specified by Delegated Regulation EU 2021/4987 in Annex I."
"3.1 Sales 
Net sales comprise sales within the meaning of Article 2(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU, i.e., the amounts derived from 
the sale of products and the rendering of services after deducting sales allowances and value added tax and other 
taxes directly related to sales."
"Furthermore, the taxonomy states that sales comprise revenue recognized in 
accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82(a) as amended by Commission 
Regulation (EC) No."
"Rheinmetall records its sales in accordance with this standard so that Group sales 
also correspond to all taxonomy sales to be considered."
"The increase in the overall total is 
explained by the fact that – in contrast to the previous fiscal year – new economic activities, such as the manufacture 
of drones or the refurbishment of end-of-life vehicles, have now been included as a result of the new environmental 
objectives."
"However, they are not reported as taxonomy-eligible in this fiscal year beyond their taxonomy-aligned 
status."
"Simulators, which meet the requirements of taxonomy alignment and were already included in the previous 
fiscal year, also account for a significant proportion this year."
"In the area of components for electric vehicles, such as 
electric water pumps used to cool batteries, considerable sales were again generated in the series production business 
this fiscal year."
"As in the previous fiscal year, considerable taxonomy-eligible sales were also generated through the 
production of civilian, logistics and special vehicles."
"In the year under review, further progress was made in 
establishing and expanding our business areas with regard to energy management and renewable energy sources."
Sales were recorded in the field of brake and transmission technology for wind turbines.
"3.2 Investments 
In contrast to sales, capital and operating expenditures are specifically defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"Accordingly, capital expenditure comprises all additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
during the fiscal year before amortization, depreciation and remeasurement, including additions from business 
combinations."
Leases that do not result in recognition of a right of use of the asset are excluded.

RHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2023 
The acquisition of Expal Munitions, S.A.U."
"resulted in a one-off significant increase in the denominator value in the 
2023 fiscal year."
"This means that this year’s KPI for investment expenditure is not very comparable with that of the 
previous fiscal year."
"The 
majority of taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure arose from the Group’s sales-generating business activities."
"Rheinmetall Immobiliengesellschaft 
accounted for a further share with investments in the acquisition and construction of new buildings."
"This capital 
expenditure primarily related to energy optimization measures at the Group’s locations."
"Both the efficient use of 
electricity and water and the use of waste heat in our production to save natural resources for heat generation 
were focus areas of the further taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure."
"3.3 Operating expenses 
The denominator of operating expenditures is limited to certain expenses."
"Consequently, the taxonomy-relevant 
transactions are also only a subset of this limited unit."
"The denominator must include direct, non-capitalized 
expenses incurred for research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leasing, maintenance 
and repair and all other direct expenses from the maintenance of property, plant and equipment to ensure 
operational readiness."
"Here, too, we have used standardized reporting formats and thus include maintenance 
costs, expenses for short-term and low-value leases, and non-capitalized expenses for research and development."
The additional determination of expenses for the daily maintenance of assets has been carried out since 2021.
"Rheinmetall understands this to mean internal expenses incurred in connection with maintenance and repair by 
its own personnel and therefore not included in other operating expenses."
"When evaluating the cost centers, care 
is taken to ensure that the total costs are adjusted for individual costs where necessary for the required data 
reporting in order to avoid double counting when determining the key figures."
"The majority of our taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure relates to areas in research and 
development that serve to expand taxonomy-eligible and-aligned activities."
"They are intended to lead to additional 
taxonomy-eligible sales and thus underscore the importance already attached to alternative drive technologies."
"In addition, operating expenditure for building refurbishment measures as well as maintenance and repair of 
property, plant and equipment has been identified that could be classified as taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-
aligned within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"3.4 Investment planning 
Non-financial undertakings must disclose material information on investment planning for each of their specified 
economic activities."
"There is currently no clear interpretation of what the investment plan includes, meaning that 
different interpretations exist with regard to the market."
"As part of its investment planning, Rheinmetall considers 
all investments that are planned for current and future taxonomy-aligned activities."
"Investments that serve to 
convert current taxonomy-eligible business into future taxonomy-aligned business are also considered."
"The resulting planned capital expenditure is reported at aggregated 
economic activity level."
"Investment planning covers a period of three years, i.e."
"for the period under review this relates to the 
period between 2024 and 2026."
"“Manufacture of renewable energy technologies,” capital 
expenditure of €6.4 million is planned for the coming years."
"In the category 3.2 “Equipment for the production and 
use of hydrogen,” further taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure of around €23.5 million is planned for the coming 
years in order to expand the product portfolio as part of our hydrogen strategy."
"Capital expenditure of around 
€36.9 million is planned for the business activities in category 3.5 “Energy-efficient equipment for buildings” in 
order to expand our taxonomy-compliant business activities."
"Further taxonomy-aligned capital 
expenditure of around €6 million is also planned in the coming years in category 4.9 “Transmission and 
distribution of electricity.”  
4."
"Conclusion 
In the first year of collecting all data to determine taxonomy-aligned economic activities, a system has already 
been developed that sets comparable standards for all divisions."
"As a result of the delegated regulation for 
environmental objectives (3 to 6) published by the EU Commission in June 2023, economic activities in all six 
environmental objectives were reported for the first time in this fiscal year."
"However, this initially only includes the 
taxonomy eligibility for environmental objectives 3 to 6 and the additions to the annexes for environmental 
objectives 1 and 2."
This causes a one-off deviation in the KPIs compared to the previous year.
"In addition, the 
increased denominator of investment expenditure due to the acquisition of Expal Munitions, S.A.U."
"this year leads 
to a distortion of the KPIs and thus to a low comparability of this year’s KPIs for investment expenditure with those 
of the previous fiscal year."
"For reasons of transparency and comparability with the previous year, capital 
expenditure is therefore presented below both including and excluding Expal Munitions, S.A.U."
"The full 
presentation of both taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities in all six environmental 
objectives will be provided from the 2024 fiscal year onwards."

"1,04% of total sales meets the requirements for taxonomy alignment."
"With the possible upcoming revisions of the legal 
texts and interpretations of the industries, future changes to the classifications cannot be ruled out at the present time."
"We will also continue to take taxonomy alignment requirements into account in all process steps in order to steadily 
increase these in subsequent years."
"The corporate governance statement in accordance with sections 289f and 
315d of the German Commercial Code can also be found here."
"Declaration of conformity in accordance with section 161 AktG 
The implementation of the recommendations of the GCGC at the Rheinmetall Group was discussed at the 
Supervisory Board meeting on August 17, 2023."
"“The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board issue the following declaration on the recommendations of the Government 
Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code (as amended on April 28, 2022 – the “Code”) in accordance with section 
161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG): 
1."
"Recommendation B.5 of the 
Code specifies that an age limit should be set for Executive Board members and stated in the corporate governance statement."
"Merch, who left 
as of December 31, 2022, would thus originally have left his position as of December 31, 2021."
"However, his employment contract 
has been extended temporarily until December 31, 2022."
"A clause on the standard age limit was not included in his new 
employment contract due to its temporary nature."
"Mr. Merch left the Executive Board as of December 31, 2022 at the age of 66."
"After Mr. Merch left the company’s Executive Board at the end of 
December 31, 2022, and thus since January 1, 2023, recommendation B.5 of the Code has been followed."
"According to the recommendation in section 
G.8 of the Code, subsequent changes to target values or comparison parameters are to be ruled out."
"The company deviated from 
this recommendation as described below: The remuneration system for members of the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG specifies 
operating free cash flow (OFCF) as a key performance indicator with a weighting of 40% within the short-term incentive (STI)."
"By 
resolution of the Supervisory Board on December 7, 2022, the target value for OFCF for fiscal 2023 was set."
"This target was set partly 
on the basis of an investment action plan for fiscal 2023."
"Due to additional investments in the interests of the company, particularly 
for the F-35 project, which were not included in the original investment planning, the investment action plan for fiscal 2023 was 
increased."
"The Supervisory Board approved this increase on August 17, 2023."
"The expansion of the investment action plan has a 
direct impact on OFCF, meaning that the OFCF target for fiscal 2023 that was set by the Supervisory Board on December 7, 2022 
would lead to significantly reduced target achievement in line with the company’s adjusted liquidity planning."
"This is intended to 
set an ambitious but essentially achievable target for the members of the Executive Board and restore the incentive effect of the 
short-term variable remuneration."
"The Supervisory Board considers this subsequent change to the target value to be necessary and 
appropriate in order to grant the Executive Board members remuneration that is commensurate with their performance and be able 
to create the right incentives for the long-term benefit of the company."
"All recommendations of the Code have been complied with since August 18, 2023."
"Convening a General Meeting is an organizational challenge for large listed 
companies – even taking into account the shorter deadlines provided for in the German Securities Acquisitions 
and Takeover Act (WpÜG)."
"It is questionable whether the level of effort involved is even justified in such cases 
where there are no relevant resolutions put forward for the General Meeting."
"Convening an Extraordinary General 
Meeting should therefore be reserved for appropriate cases only."
"Description of the working methods of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board 
With its Executive Board and Supervisory Board, Rheinmetall AG has a two-tier management and monitoring 
structure."
"Both bodies are responsible for and obligated to operate in the interests of the shareholders and the 
well-being of the company."
They work together closely and trustfully in the interests of Rheinmetall.
"The Supervisory Board and its committees have adopted rules of procedure that set forth, among other things, the 
supply of information to the Supervisory Board by the Executive Board."
"In accordance with recommendation D.1 
of the GCGC, the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board have been made permanently available to the public 
on the company’s website."
"The chairs of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board also maintain regular contact between the 
scheduled meetings and discuss issues relating to strategy, business development, planning, risk management 
and compliance within the company."
"The remuneration report for fiscal 2022, which was prepared and 
audited in accordance with section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act, was approved by the 2023 Annual 
General Meeting with 96.27% votes in favor."
"In addition, the remuneration report including the auditor’s report, 
the applicable remuneration system and the last remuneration resolution of the Annual General Meeting are 
published on our website."
"Composition of the Executive Board 
In accordance with Article 6(1) of the Articles of Association, the Executive Board of the company is composed of 
at least two persons."
The number of members is determined by the Supervisory Board.
"In the year under review, 
Armin Papperger, Dagmar Steinert and Peter Sebastian Krause were appointed as members of the Executive Board."
"With the support of members of the Personnel and Remuneration Committee and the Executive Board, the 
Supervisory Board is responsible for long-term successor planning for the Executive Board."
"The Supervisory Board is then given 
a recommendation for their consideration."
"If necessary, external consultants help the Supervisory Board/the 
Personnel and Remuneration Committee to draw up the requirements profiles and select ideal candidates."
"It defines long-term strategic 
orientation and corporate policy as well as the structure and organization of the Rheinmetall Group and allocates 
resources."
"The Executive Board manages the company on its own initiative in the interests of the company, i.e."
It represents the company to third parties.
"The Rules of Procedure for the Executive Board govern the Board’s work, the allocation of duties among the 
respective Executive Board members, matters reserved for the Executive Board as a whole and the majority 
required for Executive Board resolutions."
"Any matters that are of fundamental importance or that have far-reaching consequences require a resolution to be 
passed by the Board as a whole."
"The Executive Board develops the strategic orientation of the company, agrees it with the Supervisory Board and 
ensures its implementation."
"It decides on basic issues relating to business policy and on annual and multi-annual 
planning."
"In addition to effective management of opportunities, it establishes risk controlling at the company."
"It 
implements appropriate measures to ensure that laws, provisions, official regulations and internal corporate 
guidelines are observed and helps to ensure that subsidiaries comply with these."
"Furthermore, the Executive 
Board keeps diversity in mind when filling management positions at the company and also makes sure that 
sufficient attention is given to women (diversity)."
"This 
applies, for example, to the acquisition and sale of shareholdings, investment planning, issuing bonds and taking 
out long-term loans."
"The Executive Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively 
regarding business performance, financial position and results of operations, planning and achievement of 
targets, as well as regarding compliance issues, strategy and the risk situation."
"On the basis of these reports, the 
Supervisory Board monitors the legality, correctness, appropriateness and economic efficiency of management by 
the Executive Board."
"The Chair of the Supervisory Board is informed immediately by the Executive Board of any important events or 
business developments that could have a significant influence on the company’s financial position, results of 
operations and net assets."
"Composition of the Supervisory Board 
In accordance with sections 96(1) and (2) and 101(1) of the German Stock Corporation Act in conjunction with 
section 7(1) no."
"2 German Codetermination Act (MitbestG), the Supervisory Board of Rheinmetall AG comprises 
eight shareholder representatives and eight employee representatives."
The shareholder representatives are selected by the Annual General Meeting.
"The nominations to the 
Shareholders’ Meeting are based on the recommendations of the Nomination Committee, which take account of 
balance and the differences in the knowledge, skills and experience of the shareholder representatives proposed 
for election to the Supervisory Board."
"As a rule, the shareholder representatives are elected for three to five years."
"Details of the length of time the individual members have belonged to the Supervisory 
Board can be found in the overview in the section »Supervisory Board report."
"These are two 
trade union representatives, five employee representatives and one representative of the managerial staff."
"When members are proposed for election to the Supervisory Board, attention is paid to their professional 
qualifications and personal skills, as well as to legal regulations (in particular the gender quota) and the 
recommendations of the GCGC."
"The Supervisory Board members have the same rights and obligations, are 
required to perform their mandate in the best interests of the company, and are not bound by any orders or 
instructions."
"The Supervisory Board must be filled with persons who provide a balanced mix of all the qualifications, 
knowledge, skills and personal characteristics needed for the supervision of a capital market-oriented, large and 
globally active technology company."
"Information on how this requirement is met and further information on the individual members of the Supervisory 
Board is provided in the overview »Members of the Supervisory Board in the section »Supervisory Board report."
"New members of the Supervisory Board familiarize themselves with the company’s business activities while 
preparing for their mandate on the Supervisory Board."
"By consulting written documentation and talking to other 
members of the Supervisory Board and Executive Board, they can familiarize themselves with the relevant issues 
and learn about the working methods of the Supervisory Board and its committees."
"To ensure the prevention of potential conflicts of interest, the Supervisory Board does not include any members 
who hold board positions or perform advisory activities for key competitors of Rheinmetall AG and its Group 
companies."
Former Executive Board members of Rheinmetall AG are not represented on the Supervisory Board.
"According 
to the assessment of the shareholder representatives in the Supervisory Board, on the shareholder side the 
Supervisory Board has a sufficient number of independent members."
"Professor Andreas Georgi is also 
considered to be independent."
"The experience and expertise obtained through his 
former position as a member of the Executive Board of Dresdner Bank AG and his current position as a professor 
specializing in corporate management and control problems at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich also 
serve him well."
"The professional, specialized qualifications more than outweigh any doubts concerning his 
independence due to the mere length of service."
"The composition of the Supervisory Board and the terms of office 
of its members are outlined in the “Letter to shareholders” section in the Supervisory Board report."
"The main contents of the Rules of Procedure, which are published 
on the company’s website, concern the composition, tasks and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, the 
convention, preparation and chairing of meetings, the rules pertaining to committees and quorum requirements."
"The Chair of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work of the Supervisory Board, chairs its meetings and 
represents the Board externally."
"Each year, he explains the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees 
in the report of the Supervisory Board printed within the annual report and orally at the Annual General Meeting."
"The Supervisory Board advises the Executive Board on the management of the company and monitors its 
management activities."
The Chair of the Supervisory Board is elected from among its members.
"Supervisory Board 
meetings are held in accordance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"As a general rule, 
four Supervisory Board meetings take place each calendar year, which are attended by members of the Executive 
Board unless otherwise stipulated by the Chair of the Supervisory Board."
"Resolutions may be passed in writing, 
by telex (fax or e-mail) or by telephone."
"The Supervisory Board passes its resolutions by means of a simple majority 
of members participating in the passing of the resolution."
"In the event of a tied vote, the Chair of the Supervisory 
Board has the casting vote."
"The Supervisory Board of Rheinmetall AG reviews the efficiency of its activities at regular intervals either internally 
or with the support of external consultants, as required by the provisions of the German Corporate Governance

"In accordance with Article 6(1) of the Articles of Association, the Executive Board of the company is composed of 
at least two persons."
The number of members of the Executive Board is determined by the Supervisory Board.
"The 
Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG comprised three members in the year under review."
"The current responsibilities 
of the members are shown on the third page of this section."
"The Supervisory Board of Rheinmetall AG set 0% as the target for the share of women on the Executive Board of 
Rheinmetall AG for the period from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2022."
"This target was achieved as of June 30, 2022."
"In 
May 2022, the Supervisory Board of Rheinmetall AG made the decision that a target for the share of women on the 
Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG of one person would be set for the period from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2025."
"This target was already met with the appointment of Dagmar Steinert as a new member of Rheinmetall AG’s 
Executive Board with effect from December 1, 2022."
"The Supervisory Board considers relative continuity in terms of staffing in the top management in the best 
interests of the company and additionally a key component for the further sustainable economic success of 
Rheinmetall AG."
"Over many years, Armin Papperger, Dagmar Steinert and Peter Sebastian Krause were systematically prepared for 
more demanding management roles in various functions and hierarchical levels and have constantly assumed 
more responsibility for larger entities during their career."
"They know the relevant industries, the industry cycles of 
the entities and the challenges facing an international technology group today, and are confronting future issues 
such as digitalization and transformation, especially in the automotive industry."
"They also have the ability to align 
business models and processes in a dynamically changing world."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board gives 
attention to supplementary profiles and professional experience as well as an adequate age mix."
"On the reporting 
date, ages in the Executive Board ranged from 59 to 63."
The average age was around 61.
"The targets for the period from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2022, for the share of women at the first and second 
management levels below the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG were set at 14.8% for the first management level 
and 27.3% for the second management level."
"At the first management level below the Executive Board of 
Rheinmetall AG, the target set for this period was exceeded."
"By contrast, the target for the share of women at the 
second management level below the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG was not fulfilled."
"One reason for this is 
that vacancies at Rheinmetall are filled by the candidate that is the most suitable both professionally and 
personally, irrespective of gender and of the target figures set."
"Male applicants were better qualified for many of 
the second level management positions at Rheinmetall AG filled during the target period."
"There are no changes to 
management positions solely on the basis of gender."
"Another key reason for not achieving the set target was the 
now uniform Group definition for the two levels of management below the Executive Board and the management 
teams in all companies of the Rheinmetall Group affected by the legal target requirements for management levels."
"In the definition of management levels used at Rheinmetall AG at the time the target was set on July 1, 2017, the 
targets set as of June 30, 2022, would have been met at a higher percentage."
"The Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG decided that for a subsequent target period from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 
2027, a share of women at the first management level below the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG of 16.13% and 
at the second management level of 15.22% should be achieved."
"The implementation deadline is June 30, 2027, in each case."
"Details can be found on the 
Rheinmetall AG website."

"Accounting and auditing 
Rheinmetall AG prepares the single-entity financial statements that are relevant for the dividend payment in 
accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act."
"The 
company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in the European Union and in accordance with the supplementary 
provisions of section 315e(1) of the German Commercial Code."

"Transparency in reporting 
In a time in which markets are interconnected and the flow of information is becoming increasingly globalized,

"Rheinmetall AG communicates openly, actively and in detail."
"Facts and circumstances that may influence the share price on the stock market are published immediately in ad 
hoc notifications in accordance with the legal regulations."
"On January 6, 2023, Rheinmetall published a record 
operating result based on preliminary figures, with double-digit percentage growth in sales and a significant 
increase in the operating margin."
"Rheinmetall AG generated consolidated sales of €6.4 billion in fiscal 2022 based 
on preliminary and unaudited figures."
"Compared with the previous year’s sales of €5,658 million (adjusted for 
discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5), this represents an increase of around 13%."
"Taking into 
account exchange rate and M&A effects, organic sales growth is around 10%, which is below the communicated 
expectations of around 15%."
"In particular, these deviations result from advance services agreed with customers 
in the area of defence technology, the call-offs for which have been postponed until 2023."
"The slower recovery in 
global automotive production also contributed to weaker sales growth in the civil sector."
"According to initial 
estimates, Rheinmetall expects a record year for the operating result with growth of more than 20%."
"Rheinmetall 
has thus increased its previous guidance for the operating margin from >11% to at least 11.5%."
"The bonds, which were offered exclusively to institutional investors in two 
tranches of equal size, will be used to raise a substantial part of the funds needed for the acquisition of Spanish

2023."

"The bonds may bear interest at a variable rate instead of a 
fixed rate, in which case the interest rate may also be fully or partly dependent on the amount of the company’s 
dividend, as with an income bond."
"The disapplication of pre-emption rights that the Executive Board can resolve 
with the approval of the Supervisory Board arises from the authorization resolution of the Annual General Meeting 
on May 11, 2021."
"The convertible 
bonds were issued on the basis of the Contingent Capital 2021 (Article 4 of the Articles of Association)."
"The 
shareholders’ statutory pre-emption right to the convertible bonds was disapplied."
"The authorisation granted at 
the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2021 has therefore been used up by more than 95%."
"The decisive figure for the company’s share capital here is the lowest level either when the 
Annual General Meeting adopted the resolution on this authorization, when this authorization took effect or when 
this authorization was exercised."

Supervisory Board is disclosed."
"The remuneration granted and owed that is shown is the remuneration for which 
the underlying activity was fully completed as of the end of fiscal year 2023."
"With the explanation of the 
remuneration system for the individual remuneration components, particular attention is paid to the transparency 
of the resulting remuneration and its promotion of Rheinmetall AG’s long-term development."
"The report is based 
on section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations and suggestions of the 
German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in the version dated April 28, 2022."
"The remuneration report for fiscal year 2022 was presented to the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2023, in 
accordance with section 120a(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and approved by a clear majority of 
96.27%."
"The very good voting result clearly shows that the fundamental structure, comprehensibility and 
transparency of last year’s remuneration report met with a high level of acceptance among shareholders."
"It 
confirms that the Executive and Supervisory Boards of Rheinmetall AG can continue the report for fiscal year 2023 
in this proven form."
"Rheinmetall AG has also received criticism from individual shareholders regarding the amount of pension 
expenses and the shape of the target achievement curve for the performance target relative total shareholder 
return."
"The expenses recognized for pensions particularly relate to commitments made prior to January 1, 2014, 
which must still be fulfilled in accordance with the employment contract."
"The target achievement curve for relative 
total shareholder return is an integral part of the remuneration system for Executive Board members, which was 
approved by a majority of 92.61% at the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2021."
"A symmetrical target 
achievement curve corresponds with German market practice and guarantees a balanced opportunity/risk profile."
"The Supervisory Board is convinced that the target achievement curve provides the right incentive to outperform 
the competition without taking disproportionate risks."
"In addition, the remuneration report presents the relative 
shares of the remuneration components (assuming 100% target achievement for variable remuneration) at the 
shareholders’ request."
"The remuneration report below and the current remuneration system for the Executive Board and the Supervisory 
Board are available on Rheinmetall AG’s website: rheinmetall.com/remunerationexecutiveboard."
"Beyond the 
requirements of section 162(3) AktG, an audit of the remuneration report was also conducted in a material respect 
by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft."
"The corresponding report on this audit can be accessed at the 
address above."
"Review of fiscal year 2023 
On the stock markets, 2023 went better than expected."
"After a strong first half of the year, neither the stagnation 
of the European economy nor the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East prompted a turn for the worse."
"Despite a 
sharp rise in interest rates, share prices recovered compared to the previous year."
"Before Christmas, the US Federal 
Reserve fulfilled financial market players’ hopes by clearly signaling three expected interest rate cuts in 2024."
"The 
DAX responded positively and exceeded 17,000 points for the first time in its history in mid-December."
"Previously, 
the Dow Jones in the US had already reached a record high, clearing 37,000 points for the first time."
"In terms of 
annual performance, the DAX therefore grew by 20.3% and closed at 16,751.64 points."
"The growth of small and 
mid-caps was notably less strong: The mid-cap index MDAX grew by 8% over the year to 27,137.30 points, while 
the SDAX and TecDAX gained 17% to 13,960.36 points and 14% to 3,337.41 points, respectively."
"The Rheinmetall share started the stock market year on January 2, 2023, at a price of €196.95 and proved friendly 
from then on."
"On February 21, 2023, it breached the €250 mark for the first time with a closing price for the day of 
€257.20."
"At €287, the year-end closing price for fiscal year 2023 was close to the all-time high of €289.80."
"In 
terms of the full year, the Rheinmetall share closed a considerable 54.26% above the previous year and 
significantly better than the DAX."
"Because the demand focused 
especially on products for land forces, Rheinmetall AG obtained a particularly large share in this trend."
The financial performance of Rheinmetall AG in the year under review proved to be robust and profitable.
"The 
altered security situation allowed us to demonstrate our responsibility as a reliable supplier of state-of-the-art 
defence technology to Germany and its allies."
"This is evidenced by major procurement projects in Germany and 
significant large orders from friendly nations."
"As a result, the operating result increased by 19.4% to a new record 
of €918 million."
And our operating margin of 12.8% exceeds last year’s 12.0%.
"The Annual General Meeting approved the 
remuneration system for members of the Executive Board by a significant majority of 92.61%."
"The new 
remuneration system has been in effect for all incumbent members of the Executive Board since January 1, 2022, 
and forms the basis for the remuneration granted and owed in fiscal year 2023."
"The Executive Board remuneration at Rheinmetall AG firstly provides for remuneration not linked to performance 
(fixed remuneration), which consists of three components: the basic remuneration, fringe benefits, and a company 
pension."
"Secondly, it includes performance-related remuneration (variable remuneration) comprising two 
components: the one-year short-term incentive (STI) and the long-term incentive (LTI)."
"The remuneration system 
also includes further provisions such as penalty and clawback, share ownership guidelines, remuneration-related 
legal transactions and the handling of internal and external remuneration for mandates."

structure of Executive Board remuneration is provided in the following chart."

and €4,000,000 for each ordinary Executive Board member."
"The maximum remuneration relates to the sum of all 
payments resulting from the remuneration regulations for a fiscal year."
"If the sum of the payments from a fiscal 
year exceeds this defined maximum remuneration, then the remuneration component due to be paid out last 
(usually the LTI) is reduced."
"For an explanation of how the defined maximum remuneration of the Executive Board 
members was complied with, please refer to item 3.4."
"The detailed examination of the Executive Board remuneration primarily includes a horizontal remuneration 
comparison, in which the level of the target and maximum remuneration received by the members of the Executive 
Board is compared with the usual remuneration for comparable companies."
"This comparison took into account

The following section describes the remuneration components in detail and shows how the performance criteria 
and targets for variable remuneration were applied in fiscal year 2023."
"2.1 Basic remuneration 
Each Executive Board member receives a basic remuneration not linked to performance, which is paid every month 
in twelve equal parts."
"Fringe benefits 
include not only the reimbursement of reasonable expenses, but also subsidies for health and long-term care 
insurance and the provision of a company car that can also be used privately in accordance with current 
guidelines."
"Accident insurance is also taken out for each Executive Board member, which may also include a 
payment to heirs of the Executive Board member in the event of his/her death."
"The tax burden resulting from these 
fringe benefits is borne by the respective Executive Board member."
"2.3 Company pension plan 
Executive Board members receive a company pension in the form of a modular capital plan."
"They receive an annual 
basic contribution of 16% of the respective basic remuneration and 100% of the target amount of the STI."
"The 
basic contribution may also be supplemented by a performance-related additional contribution."
"The additional 
contribution is capped with an upper limit equal to 30% of the basic contribution."
"The basic contribution and, if applicable, a performance-related additional contribution are converted annually to 
a capital component with a capitalization factor linked to the benefits age."
"The sum of the capital components 
acquired in the past few calendar years yields the total pension capital."
"The total pension capital is converted to 
a lifelong pension when benefits become due."
The retirement age is 65.
"For Executive Board members who had acquired pension claims before January 1, 2014, or were previously a 
member of the Executive Board of Rheinmetall Automotive AG, a transitional regulation applies."
"The average 
defined benefit for these Executive Board members is 27.5% of the respective basic remuneration and the 
respective 100% target amount of the STI before retirement."
The retirement age is 63.
"The expenses and present values of the pension obligations for Executive Board members active in fiscal year 
2023 are shown below."
"Depending on the Executive Board member, 
the provisions have been recognized since they joined the Executive Board and thus over a long period."
"2.4 Short-term incentive (STI) 
The remuneration system provides for a one-year STI, the level of which depends on an individual target amount 
in euro agreed in the Executive Board employment contracts and on the achievement of financial and non-financial 
targets."
"The STI for fiscal year 2023, which is to be disclosed in fiscal year 2023 as remuneration granted and 
owed, corresponds to the remuneration system presented to and approved by the Annual General Meeting on May 
11, 2021."
"The two key performance indicators earnings before taxes (EBT) and operating free cash flow (OFCF) are taken into 
account as financial targets, each with a weighting of 40%."
"EBT is particularly well-suited for assessing the 
economic success of the Rheinmetall Group’s operational entities."
"In addition, OFCF is used as a key figure to 
ensure liquidity and entrepreneurial flexibility."
"There is also a component that takes into account non-financial, individual, and further collective targets with a 
weighting of 20% in the STI."
"The underlying targets are determined by the Supervisory Board for the respective 
fiscal 
year."
"The 
weighted 
total 
of 
the 
target 
achievements 
across 
the 
financial 
and 
non-
financial/individual/collective component targets results in the overall target achievement."
"Target achievement is capped at 2.5 times the target value, with this figure being achieved with a +20% target 
overachievement (maximal target fulfillment)."
"If the target achievement is -20% or lower (minimal target 
achievement), the STI for the fiscal year in question is €0."
"The table below shows the specific target achievement 
levels depending on the deviation from the target value, with target achievements between the key figures shown 
being determined using linear interpolation."
"Target achievement is determined in each case by comparing the actual value 
with the target value and applying the key figures shown above."
"At that time, however, it was not yet foreseeable whether and when this transaction would actually 
be completed."
"The planning for 2023–25 was therefore intentionally prepared without potential effects of this 
acquisition."
"For this reason, the targets for 2023 likewise do not take this acquisition into account."
"For the purpose 
of target achievement, the actual figures are therefore adjusted to present earnings before taxes and operating 
free cash flow as if the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
had not taken place in 2023.
"Accordingly, earnings 
contributions from the acquired companies, including effects from the purchase price allocation, are deducted 
from earnings before taxes."
"The same applies to the financing expenses and other acquisition costs recognized in 
expenses."
Operating free cash flow is adjusted accordingly.
"This target was set partly on the basis of an investment action plan for fiscal 
year 2023."
"This was increased due to additional investments in the interests of the company, which were not 
included in the original investment planning."
"The Supervisory Board approved this increase on August 17, 2023."
"This set an ambitious 
but essentially achievable target for the members of the Executive Board and restored the incentive effect of the 
STI."
"The Supervisory Board considers this subsequent change to the target value to be necessary and appropriate 
in order to grant the Executive Board members remuneration that is commensurate with their performance and be 
able to create the right incentives for the long-term benefit of Rheinmetall AG."
"Both systems for CO2 reduction were 
put into operation in the 4th quarter of 2023."
"The ROI of the photovoltaic system 
is < 5 years."
"200.0  
50.0 
Measures based on the 
German Supply Chain 
Compliance Act  and 
establishment of a 
Rheinmetall-specific 
compliance structure for 
activities at Expal 
 
The objective was achieved in full with great success."
"250.0

The individual payment amounts for the Executive Board members shown below are derived from the target 
achievements presented."
"2.5 Long-term incentive (LTI) 
The Executive Board remuneration system makes a significant contribution to promoting the business strategy 
and sets incentives for the Executive Board that serve the sustainable and long-term development of Rheinmetall 
AG."
"To this end, Executive Board members are allocated an annual LTI in the form of a performance share plan, i.e."
"on the basis of virtual shares, each with a four-year term or performance period."
"The Executive Board members 
also received an allocation from the performance share plan for fiscal year 2023."
"As the four-year performance 
period does not end until fiscal year 2026, the 2023 tranche is not to be disclosed as remuneration granted and 
owed until fiscal year 2026."
"For reasons of transparency, however, the operating principle and allocation amounts 
for each Executive Board member are reported below."
"At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Executive Board members are allocated a new tranche of virtual shares 
under the performance share plan."
"An individual target amount corresponding to 100% target achievement has 
been agreed in the Executive Board employment contracts."
"The individual target amount is divided by the average 
closing price of Rheinmetall shares over the last 30 stock market trading days prior to the start of the performance 
period to obtain a preliminary number of virtual shares."
"This is paid out in cash to the Executive Board members at the end of the four-year 
performance period and is limited to a maximum of 250% of the individual target amount (cap)."
"The payment 
amount can therefore be between 0% and 250% of the original target amount."
Rheinmetall AG’s TSR is compared with the EURO STOXX Industrial Goods & Services companies.
"The TSR is the 
share price performance plus notional reinvested gross dividends during the four-year performance period."
"The 
start and end values for determining the TSR of Rheinmetall AG and the peer companies are based on the average 
value of the last 30 stock market trading days before the beginning and before the end of the respective four-year 
performance period."
"To determine the relative TSR, the TSR values (over four years) of all companies including 
Rheinmetall AG are placed in order and assigned to percentiles."
"If the TSR of the Rheinmetall share is in the 50th 
percentile (median), target achievement is 100%."
"If the TSR is in or below the 25th percentile, target achievement 
is 0%."
"If the TSR is in the 75th percentile, target achievement is 200%."
"Positioning above the 75th percentile does 
not result in any further increase in target achievement."
"Between the 25th and 75th percentiles, target achievement 
is calculated using linear interpolation."
"The ROCE actually achieved is determined annually 
on the basis of the Rheinmetall consolidated financial statements."
"Subsequently, the average ROCE during the 
four-year performance period is calculated, i.e."
"for the 2023 installment, the ROCE actually achieved in fiscal years 
2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 is decisive."
"To determine target achievement, average ROCE is compared with an 
ambitious target value set by the Supervisory Board based on the strategic plan."
"If the average ROCE actually 
achieved corresponds exactly to the target value, target achievement is 100%."
"If the average ROCE is exactly 2 
percentage points below the target value, target achievement is 50%."
"If the average ROCE is 2 percentage points 
below the target value, target achievement is 0%."
"If the average ROCE is 2 percentage points or more above the 
target value, target achievement is 200%."
"If the target achievement of 200% is reached, further increases in the 
ROCE actually achieved do not lead to any further increase in target achievement."
"Between the above points, target 
achievement is calculated using linear interpolation."
"ROCE target achievement curve 
 
 
The third performance target is formed by the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targets."
"The ESG targets 
set incentives for sustainable corporate development, promote the implementation of Rheinmetall AG’s 
sustainability strategy and take into account the business’ impact on the environment."
"For the annual 
determination of the relevant and measurable ESG targets, the Supervisory Board is guided by a catalog of criteria 
defined in advance."
"For each tranche, other criteria or targets can be selected from the catalog of criteria, the 
achievement of which is measured during the four-year performance period and, analogously to the financial 
targets, can range from 0% to 200% per ESG target."
"2.6 Malus and clawback 
To further ensure the sustainable successful development of the company and the appropriateness of Executive 
Board remuneration, the STI and LTI are subject to penalty and clawback regulations."
"If, after payment of the 
performance-related variable remuneration (STI and LTI), it transpires that the consolidated financial statements 
were incorrect, the Supervisory Board may demand partial or full repayment of variable remuneration already paid 
out (performance clawback)."
"The amount of the claim for repayment shall be determined on the basis of the 
corrected and audited consolidated financial statements."
"The fault of the Executive Board member is irrelevant in 
this case."
"There were no circumstances either in fiscal year 2023 or in fiscal year 2022 that would have justified withholding 
or reclaiming the variable remuneration under the penalty and clawback provisions."
"2.7 Share ownership guidelines (SOG) 
To further align the interests of the Executive Board and shareholders, the Executive Board members are required 
to make a significant personal investment in Rheinmetall shares."
"As 
of December 31, 2023, Armin Papperger, Peter Sebastian Krause, and Dagmar Steinert had already invested the 
required amount in Rheinmetall shares and fulfilled the holding obligation."
"It is possible, however, for both the 
Executive Board member concerned and Rheinmetall AG to terminate the contract for cause."
"Automatic 
termination is also stipulated in the event that the Executive Board member becomes permanently unable to work 
during the term of their contract."
The remuneration system also provides for a severance payment cap.
"The Executive Board contracts do not provide for any special arrangements for a severance payment in the event 
of a change of control."
"2.9 Remuneration for mandates 
The Executive Board remuneration covers all activities for Rheinmetall AG and for services performed with 
Rheinmetall AG in accordance with sections 15 et seq."
of the German Stock Corporation Act.
"If remuneration is 
agreed for mandates at affiliated companies, this is offset against the basic remuneration."
"For mandates at 
companies that are not affiliated companies or for functions in associations or similar groups to which Rheinmetall 
AG or one of its affiliated companies belongs, the Supervisory Board decides on setting-off."
"The target amount for the STI or LTI 
reflects the contractually regulated STI or LTI target amount in the case of 100% target achievement."
"In addition, the expenses in accordance with IAS 19 for the 
company pension plan in the respective fiscal year are shown (pension expenses)."
"In accordance with the vesting-based interpretation, the payment amounts of the STI allocation for fiscal year 2023 
are shown in the 2023 remuneration report, as the underlying activity for the remuneration has already been fully 
completed at the end of fiscal year 2023."
"The relevant results for determining the target achievement levels can 
already be determined as of the end of fiscal year 2023, although the actual payment will not take place until the 
following year, i.e."
"Paid and owed remuneration of former members of the executive board 
 
 
Helmut P."
3.4 Compliance with the maximum remuneration in accordance with section 87a(1) sentence 2 no.
"1 AktG  
The maximum remuneration in accordance with section 87a(1) sentence 2 no."
"1 AktG shall include all remuneration 
components allocated for fiscal year 2023."
"The maximum remuneration for fiscal year 2023 therefore also includes 
the 2023 performance share plan tranche, although the amount paid out will not be known until the end of the 
2026 financial year."
"This means that the sum of all remuneration components allocated for fiscal year 2023 can 
only be determined after the end of fiscal year 2026."
"In principle, the appropriateness of the possible payment 
amounts is ensured by limiting the STI and LTI payments in each case to a maximum of 250% of the individual 
target amount."
"If the sum of the payments from a fiscal year exceeds this defined maximum remuneration, then 
the remuneration component due to be paid out last (usually the LTI) is reduced."
"On May 11, 2021, Rheinmetall AG’s Annual General Meeting approved the Supervisory Board remuneration 
regulation put to the vote under agenda item 8 with a clear majority of 99.75%."
"The aim of the remuneration is to 
strengthen the independence of the Supervisory Board as a supervisory body and to take into account the 
function-specific time burdens and responsibilities."
"This is achieved through the highlighted remuneration for the 
Chair and Vice Chair of the Supervisory Board and the additional remuneration for work on committees."
"The attendance fee for Supervisory Board meetings is €1,000."
"The attendance fee for committee 
meetings that are not held on the same day as a Supervisory Board meeting is €1,000."
"Supervisory Board and 
committee members who belonged to the Supervisory Board or a committee for only part of the fiscal year receive 
remuneration on a pro rata temporis basis."
"In addition, Rheinmetall AG reimburses Supervisory Board members 
for expenses incurred for Supervisory Board meetings upon request."
"Each member of the Supervisory Board – with the exception of the employee representatives – is required to 
deploy 25% of the fixed remuneration paid for acquiring shares in Rheinmetall AG and to hold the shares for the 
length of the membership in the Supervisory Board."
"Compliance with the holding obligation is to be demonstrated 
to Rheinmetall AG."
"The aforementioned obligation to buy shares does not apply to remuneration that has not yet 
been paid at the time of departure from the Supervisory Board."
"The claim to the part of the remuneration referred 
to in Article 13(6) sentence 1 of the Articles of Association does not apply retroactively if the member of the 
Supervisory Board partly or fully sells or loans the acquired shares before his departure from the Supervisory 
Board."
"The Supervisory Board members are covered by any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that has been taken 
out by Rheinmetall AG in its own interests in an appropriate amount and with an appropriate deductible for 
members of management bodies and certain other managers."
The premiums for this are paid by Rheinmetall AG.

investment in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
Further information and reconciliations can be found under note »(33) “Notes to the segment report”.
"The consolidated financial statements of 
Rheinmetall AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations of section 315e(1) of the German 
Commercial Code (“HGB”) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union (EU)."
"The consolidated financial statements and the Group management report, which is combined with the 
management report of Rheinmetall AG, are published in the company register."
"The consolidated financial 
statements were prepared by the Executive Board on March 12, 2024."
"The prepared financial statements were then 
submitted to the Supervisory Board for review and approval and authorized for issue."
The Rheinmetall Group is an international group for leading technologies in the mobility and security sectors.
"The 
Group also operates in the real estate development sector."
"The fiscal year of Rheinmetall AG and the financial 
statements of subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements is the calendar year."
"The 
consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (€)."
"Unless stated otherwise, all amounts – including 
those for the previous year – are reported in millions of euro (€ million)."
"All figures in these consolidated financial 
statements have been rounded on a standalone basis."
"This can result in minor deviations when adding figures 
together."
The consolidated income statement has been presented in the total cost (nature of expense) format.
"Only matters 
significant to the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Rheinmetall Group are explained 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Material information specifically includes company-specific information 
in connection with material events or transactions, such as complex accounting facts, the use of an accounting 
option or the change of accounting policies."
The amendments to IAS 8 aim to clarify the distinction between accounting changes and a change in estimates.
"It 
is stated that accounting estimates relate to monetary values in the financial statements subject to measurement 
uncertainty."
"The amendments to IAS 12 (“Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction”) 
clarify that the initial recognition exemption provided in IAS 12 does not apply to certain transactions."
"Accordingly, 
the initial recognition exemption no longer applies to transactions in which equal amounts of deductible and 
taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition."
"This amendment means that deferred tax is recognized 
on leases accounted for by the lessee and on decommissioning obligations."
"The amendments also stipulate targeted disclosures in the notes 
that are intended to give users of the report an understanding of the degree to which the company is affected by 
the implementation of the global tax regulations on minimum taxation."
IFRS 17 is the new accounting standard for insurance contracts.
"The new standard regulates the recognition, 
measurement and disclosure of insurance contracts and replaces the previous regulations in accordance with IFRS 
4 (Insurance Contracts)."
"The amendments to IFRS 17 from June 25, 2020, provide additional clarifications to IFRS 
17 and defer the date of initial application set by IASB from January 1, 2021, to January 1, 2023."
"The other 
amendments to IFRS 17 relate to the transition requirements for entities that will first apply IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 at 
the same time."
"The amendments improve the requirements for the comparative information presented about 
financial assets at initial application."
"The application of the amended standards had no material effect on the presentation of the Rheinmetall Group’s 
net assets, financial position and results of operations."
"The amendments to IAS 1 (“Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current”) specify the regulation on 
classifying liabilities as current or non-current in cases of uncertainty as to the settlement amount."
"In particular, 
they clarify that classification is aligned to the rights the company has at the end of the reporting period."
"The IASB 
has deferred the effective date to January 1, 2024."
"The further amendments to IAS 1 (“Non-current Liabilities with Covenants”) relate to classifications of liabilities 
(as current or non-current) for which certain covenants have been agreed."
"With the amendments issued, the IASB 
clarifies that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the 
classification of a liability as current or non-current."
"In addition, the amendments specify additional disclosure 
requirements for non-current liabilities with covenants."
"The amendments to IFRS 16 contain unifying provisions for how a seller-lessee subsequently measures sale and 
leaseback transactions."
"They require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a sale 
and leaseback in a way that it does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it 
retains."
"The subsequent measurement of lease liabilities in connection with a sale and leaseback must include 
the expected payments at the commencement date."
"In each period, the lease liability is reduced by the expected 
payments, and the difference compared with the actual payments is recognized through profit or loss."
"The following amendments have not yet been implemented in European law as they are not yet endorsed:  
The amendments to IAS 7 supplement the disclosure regulations in connection with supplier finance 
arrangements (reverse factoring arrangements)."
"As a result of the amendments, the terms and conditions of 
supplier finance arrangements must be disclosed."
"Furthermore, disclosures must be made with regard to the ranges of the payment terms for these 
financial liabilities and for comparable trade payables that do not form part of such finance arrangements with 
suppliers."
"As a result of the amendments to IFRS 7, information on liquidity risk must also be provided for supplier 
finance arrangements."
"The amendments to IAS 21 establish regulations that can be used to determine whether two currencies are 
exchangeable with one another and how the exchange rates are to be determined if a currency is not 
exchangeable."
"A currency is considered to be exchangeable if a company can exchange this currency into another 
at the measurement date on markets or using exchange mechanisms."
"If a company can only obtain an immaterial 
amount of the other currency, then a currency is not exchangeable into another currency."
"In this case, the closing 
rate is estimated by the company."
"This is to be done using the rate that would have applied to a properly executed 
transaction between market participants and which would reflect the prevailing economic conditions."
"The application of the new and amended standards and interpretations is not expected to have a material effect 
on the presentation of the Rheinmetall Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations."
"(3) Accounting policies 
The key accounting policies and measurement principles applied to Rheinmetall AG’s consolidated financial 
statements are described below."
"Cost – Cost includes the purchase price and all incidental costs that can be directly (with the exception of company 
acquisitions as defined by IFRS 3 and financial instruments measured at fair value) attributed to the purchase."
"In 
the event of an exchange, cost equals the fair value of the asset given in an exchange of assets transaction as of 
the date of the exchange, whereby any cash compensation is accounted for accordingly."
"Cost includes all expenditures that are directly attributable to the production process and an appropriate share of 
production-related overheads."
"The latter comprise material and production overheads including production-
related depreciation and social security expenses as well as pro rata administrative costs."
"Overheads are allocated 
to production costs on the basis of the production facilities’ normal capacity utilization."
"Financing costs are capitalized as costs if they relate to assets which are produced or purchased over a period 
exceeding one year."
"Grants and allowances – Government grants provided for the acquisition of an asset are deducted from the 
corresponding capital expenditures."
"Any government grants for expenses for purposes other than investment 
activities are recognized as deferred income and amortized to profit via other operating income when the related 
expenses are incurred."
"Private investment-related grants from customers are also recognized as deferred income 
and amortized to profit over the contract term."
"If economic ownership of the subsidized asset is transferred to the 
customer, sales are recognized on the date of the transfer."
"Impairment – If there are indications of impairment on an asset or a cash-generating unit (CGU) and the 
recoverable amount is less than the amortized cost, an impairment loss is recognized."
"If indications for impairment 
cease to exist, impairment losses are reversed, with the exception of goodwill."
"The reversal cannot exceed the 
value of amortized cost that would have resulted if no impairment had been charged."
"Goodwill – Goodwill in the amount of the potential benefit is allocated to the cash-generating units at the level of 
which management monitors goodwill."
"It is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment once a year at the 
end of the reporting period and during the year if there are indications of impairment."
"The impairment test 
compares the carrying amount to the recoverable amount."
"Fair value less costs to sell determined applying the 
discounted cash flow method based on the current corporate planning is used as the recoverable amount."
"If this 
value is below the carrying amount, a check is made as to whether the value in use results in a higher recoverable 
amount."
"If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, impairment is recognized down to the 
recoverable amount, which is reported as a write-down."
The subsequent reversal of write-downs is not permitted.
"Research costs are always recognized in 
expenses."
"Development costs are only capitalized if a newly developed product or process can be clearly defined, 
is technically feasible and is intended either for own use or marketing purposes."
"Furthermore, capitalization 
requires that the costs can be reliably measured and there is reasonable assurance of a future economic benefit."
Any other development costs are immediately expensed.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized from the date of first use over the economic lives.
Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life.
"Rheinmetall as the lessee recognizes a financial liability in the amount of the present value of the lease payments 
to be made over the term of the lease."
"The calculated lease payments are discounted at the date of commencement of the lease by the appropriate 
incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease term."
"The lease liability is reduced by the repayment portion of 
the lease payment until the lease expires."
"At the same time, Rheinmetall as lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset equal to the cost at the date of 
commencement of the lease."
"Starting at the value of the lease liability, the cost is increased in some circumstances 
by initial direct costs, dismantling costs, and lease payments that are made by the lessee before or at the 
commencement of the transfer of use and therefore not included in the lease liability."
"The right-of-use assets are 
amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the leases and the useful life of the relevant leased asset."
"In the case of leases with a term of less than one year, lease payments are recognized directly in other operating 
expenses."
"The same applies to leases for low-value assets whose value is less than €50 thousand and which are 
not land, buildings, or vehicles."
"Investment property – Investment property is property held to earn rental income or to benefit from long-term 
capital appreciation, and not for use in production or administration."
"Depreciation is recognized on 
a straight-line basis over a useful life of 20 to 50 years."
Financial instruments – The first-time recognition of financial instruments is at fair value.
"In the case of a financial 
asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, incidental costs are included on first-time 
recognition."
"Standard market purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized for the first time on the 
settlement date."
This is the date when the financial instrument is delivered or the payment is made.
"Notwithstanding this, derivatives are recognized for the first time as of the date when the contract is concluded or 
the trading date."
"There are three measurement categories for the subsequent measurement of financial instruments: (1) 
measurement at amortized cost, (2) measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and 
(3) measurement at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)."
"The relevant measurement category for a financial 
instrument depends on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset and the entity’s business 
model for managing financial assets."
"If the contractual cash flows comprise solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) and the business model is 
“hold,” financial instruments are measured at amortized cost."
"Financial instruments with SPPI cash flows but the 
“hold and sell” business model are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"If the SPPI 
criterion is not met, the financial instruments are likewise measured at fair value, but the changes in value are 
recognized through profit or loss."
"In the case of debt instruments, changes in value can be recognized through 
profit or loss despite fulfillment of the SPPI criterion by exercising the fair value option."
"Currently there are no 
situations in which the fair value option is used for debt instruments."
"In the case of equity instruments, the fair 
value OCI option provides the opportunity to recognize any changes in value that arise through other 
comprehensive income."
Trade receivables and liquid financial assets are generally measured at amortized cost.
"Trade receivables 
classified by Group companies as available for sale must be measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income."
"Other financial assets measured at amortized cost are discounted by applying rates that match their 
maturity on first-time recognition and written down using the effective interest method."
"As of the end of the 
reporting period, the default risk of financial assets is checked and, if necessary, an impairment recognized on 
the basis of expected losses."
"For trade receivables the simplified method is used, applying the customer credit 
rating and specific country risks."
"The loss allowance for expected default risks is recognized in the income 
statement."
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost.
"Cash and cash equivalents comprise any liquid assets 
with a remaining term of less than three months at the date of their purchase."
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in the income statement.
"If the 
conditions under IFRS 9 are met, they are accounted for as cash flow hedges."
"The effective portion of the changes 
in the fair value of the designated derivative is recognized in equity in the hedge reserve."
"The cumulative changes 
in fair value are reclassified from equity to the income statement if the hedged item is recognized in the income 
statement."
"Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge are always recognized in 
the income statement."
Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
"Compound financial instruments – Rheinmetall has issued a compound financial instrument in the form of a 
convertible bond."
"Provided certain criteria are met, the convertible bond grants the holder the right to convert it 
into a certain number of shares."
"On initial recognition, the liability component of the compound financial instrument is recognized at the fair value 
of a similar bond without a conversion right."
"The equity component is recognized in the amount of the difference 
between the fair value of the total compound financial instrument and the fair value of the liability component."
"Directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the debt and equity components in the ratio of their carrying 
amounts on initial recognition."
"By 
contrast, the equity component remains unchanged during the term of the compound financial instrument."
"When 
exercising the conversion right at the end of the term, the liability component is transferred to equity without any 
effect on profit or loss."
The interest incurred in connection with the compound financial instrument is recognized through profit or loss.
"Inventories – Inventories are carried at cost, usually using the weighted average."
"Inherent risks due to reduced 
utility or to obsolescence are adequately allowed for."
"If the net realizable value of inventories is lower than their 
carrying amount as of the end of the reporting period, they are written down to net realizable value."
"The write-
down is recognized either as cost of materials (raw materials and supplies) or a change in inventories of finished 
products and work in progress."
"If the net realizable value of inventories previously written down increases, the 
ensuing reversal is routinely offset against cost of materials (raw materials and supplies) or recognized as a 
change in inventories of finished products and work in progress."
"A discontinued operation classified as held for sale in accordance with the criteria of IFRS 5 is recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements under discontinued operations."
"At the reclassification date, the discontinued 
operation is stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell."
"Depreciation and amortization 
are suspended from the reclassification date."
"Assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the 
measurement requirements of IFRS 5 are measured in accordance with the standards applicable to them."
"The 
elimination entries for transactions between continuing and discontinued operations are assigned in full to 
discontinued operations."
"In reporting, the activities of the discontinued operation are not assigned to a reportable 
segment."
"Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are reclassified to the “assets held for sale” and “liabilities 
directly associated with assets held for sale” items in the statement of financial position."
"The previous year’s 
statement of financial position items are not reclassified."
"The 
previous year’s figures in the income statement are restated accordingly."
"The statement of cash flows continues 
to comprise the cash flows of the entire Group and is supplemented by an “of which” item for the net cash flows 
of discontinued operations."
"Contract assets and contract liabilities – Contract assets are recognized in connection with contracts with 
customers if, in the case of contract manufacturing, the cumulative sales recognized over time exceed the sum of 
the advance payments received and progress billings."
"As of the end of the reporting period, this asset item is 
tested for impairment, and, if necessary, an impairment is recognized on the basis of expected losses."
"If the 
recognized sales are lower than the sum of the advance payments received and progress billings, a contract 
liability is recognized."
"A contract liability is also recognized if advance payments are received and consideration 
has not yet been provided."
"Deferred taxes – Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary measurement differences between items shown in 
the statement of financial position under IFRS and according to the local tax laws of the individual companies."
"Deferred tax assets also include the tax assets receivable from the expected future utilization of tax loss 
carryforwards (if their realization is reasonably certain)."
"Deferred taxes are calculated on the basis of the tax rates 
applicable or announced in each country as of the end of the reporting period."
"Income tax liabilities are recognized on the basis of appropriate estimates for obligations to the respective 
national tax authorities that are uncertain in terms of amount and probability of occurrence."
"The tax rate specific 
to the company effective at the end of the reporting period is used."
"Other factors are also taken into account, such 
as experience from previous external audits and different legal interpretations between taxpayers and the tax 
authorities with regard to the issue at hand."
Uncertain income tax items are recognized at the most likely amount.
"Under this program, the beneficiaries are paid 
performance-related remuneration for the past fiscal year in the subsequent year."
"The remuneration comprises a 
cash component and a component settled in shares."
"This remuneration program existed for the Executive Board 
until the end of fiscal 2021."
"Since fiscal 2022, the Executive Board members have been granted virtual shares as part of the long-term incentive 
program (hereinafter LTI 2.0)."
"On the basis of an individual target amount, at the allocation date the beneficiaries 
are promised a special payment at the end of the term, which depends among other things on the share price 
performance of Rheinmetall AG."
The remuneration cost is recognized through profit or loss until the vesting date.
Please refer to the remuneration report for further information.
"Since fiscal 2018, employees of participating Group companies have had the option to purchase Rheinmetall 
shares at reduced prices."
"The reduction constitutes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction for 
services or work provided."
"The payments thus fall within the scope of IFRS 2 and are recognized in personnel 
expenses."
"Pensions – Pension provisions for defined benefit plan obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit 
method."
"The amount of obligations is calculated based on assumptions concerning mortality, expected future pay 
and pension increases, plan participant turnover rates, the discount rate and other actuarial parameters."
"The fair 
value of the plan assets is deducted from the DBO volume."
"Any excess of plan assets over the DBO volume (a 
defined benefit asset) is only recognized if and to the extent that it can actually be utilized."
"If there are deviations 
between the actuarial assumptions and the actual development of underlying parameters used to calculate the 
projected unit credits of the pension assets, gains and losses arise from remeasurement of the net defined benefit 
liability."
"These effects arising from remeasurement and the asset cap are recognized directly in equity under 
retained earnings in the year they occur."
"Under defined contribution plans, the company incurs no obligations other than to pay the contributions to 
earmarked post-employment benefit plans."
The payments incurred are recognized in personnel expenses.
The Rheinmetall Group also participates in multi-employer pension plans.
"As these are defined benefit plans, they 
are accounted for accordingly."
"Provisions – Other provisions take into account all identifiable commitments and obligations to third parties if 
based on past transactions or events and if it is probable that an outflow of resources (which can be reliably 
estimated) embodying economic benefits results."
"If the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted 
to their settlement amount as of the end of the reporting period."
"The settlement amount also accounts for 
identifiable future cost increases."
"Revenue recognition – Revenue is recognized when the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer 
and the customer obtains control over them."
"Revenue is measured at the transaction price that is expected to be 
received as consideration."
The transaction price is lowered by variable consideration (e.g.
"rebates, bonuses, and 
penalties for late deliveries) or increased by agreed and estimated price adjustments."
"If a contract with a customer relates to contract manufacturing, in which customer-specific products including a 
significant integration service are provided, the revenue is recognized over time."
"The revenue to be recognized is 
determined by the percentage of completion of the respective contract."
"This is calculated as the ratio of costs 
actually incurred to the estimated total costs."
"The costs associated with the customer contract are recognized in 
the income statement when incurred."
"In the case of service contracts, the revenue for the period is usually 
determined pro rata temporis."
Interests and dividends – Interest income and expense are recognized on an accrual basis.
"Dividends are 
recognized in income when the legal claim to payment is established."
"When examining the recognition of goodwill of €1,125 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: 
€483 million), assumptions and estimates relating to forecasts and the discounting of future cash flows were 
made to calculate the recoverable amount of the relevant cash-generating units."
"Details of the parameters used 
are provided under »note (18)."
"When calculating the recoverable amounts, assumptions 
and estimates are made on the cash flows from realizable sales prices, costs and the discount rates."
"The yield 
curves used in the measurement of derivatives include assumptions about the expected future development of 
interest rates, taking into account estimated liquidity risks dependent on terms."
"Moreover, the measurement 
models used also incorporate parameters that are based on assumptions about volatilities and discount rates."
"At the end of the reporting period, discontinued operations are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell."
"The measurement of fair value less costs to sell is based on assumptions and estimates 
and takes value-relevant information from the ongoing selling process into account."
"As of December 31, 2023, the 
net carrying amount of discontinued operations was €34 million (previous year: €130 million)."
"The effect of changes in the parameters used as of the end of the 
reporting period on the present value of the DBO is shown under »note (28)."
"The recognition of sales over time in the amount of €1,961 million in fiscal 2023 (previous year: €1,649 million) is 
based on estimates of the expected total contract costs and contract revenue."
"Comparing the actual contract costs 
incurred to expected total costs shows the percentage of completion as of the end of the reporting period, on the 
basis of which the pro rata sales for the period are calculated."
"When assessing and accounting for legal risks and opportunities, estimates on the possible occurrence and the 
amount of the expected obligations are made."
"In the process, the management deploys internal legal assessments 
and evaluations by external attorneys."
The respective assumptions and estimates are based on premises which account for the most recent knowledge.
Actual developments may result in amounts differing from these estimates.
"Changes in accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period of change where the change affects this period only."
"If changes in estimates affect both 
the current period and future periods, these are recognized in the periods in question."
"Judgments – Alongside the impact of estimates on the presentation of assets and liabilities as well as income and 
expenses in the consolidated financial statements, the application of accounting principles is partly dependent 
on judgments."
"A key element of business activities in the divisions of the Vehicle Systems segment, in the Weapon and 
Ammunition division, and in the Electronic Solutions division comprises long-term customer contracts with 
different performance obligations."
"Thus, sales are frequently recognized over a period of time."
"The application of 
accounting standards also requires judgments in determining the type of sales realization and identifying 
(individual) performance obligations."
The acquisition of the shares in Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land Ltd.
"in 2019 requires Rheinmetall to make 
payments to the BAE Group’s pension fund for the entitlements earned by the acquired employees."
"If the 
recognized pension obligations of Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land Ltd."
"are not covered by plan assets, Rheinmetall 
has a claim to reimbursement from the BAE Group in the same amount."
"If the plan assets exceed the recognized 
pension obligations of Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land Ltd., this amount is not recognized as an asset (asset 
ceiling)."
"Taking into consideration the relevant accounting principles, both the obligation and the claim to 
reimbursement are recognized on a gross basis."
"(4) Currency translation 
In the separate financial statements of consolidated companies, each foreign currency transaction is recognized 
at the historical rate."
"Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the 
closing rate."
"Other assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the time of the transaction if they 
are accounted for using the historical cost convention."
"These assets and liabilities are translated at the rate 
prevailing at the respective measurement date if they are measured at fair value."
"Any currency translation 
differences that arise are duly recognized in the net financial result."
"The single-entity financial statements of Group companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated 
into euro as the Group currency."
"The translation differences 
resulting from this are recognized in, and only in, equity as other comprehensive income (OCI)."
"(5) Consolidation principles 
Subsidiaries – Besides Rheinmetall AG, the consolidated financial statements include all German and foreign 
subsidiaries over which Rheinmetall AG can directly or indirectly exercise a controlling influence."
"Rheinmetall AG 
controls an entity if it holds the majority of voting rights or other rights and is therefore able to steer the significant 
activities of the investee, is exposed to the risk of variable returns from the investment and can use its power over 
the investee to influence its returns."
"Receivables and payables, expenses and income and intercompany profits/losses among consolidated 
companies are eliminated."
"Taxes are deferred for all temporary differences from the consolidation of 
receivables/payables, income/expenses, and the elimination of intercompany profits/losses."
A subsidiary is included in consolidation for the first time in accordance with the acquisition method.
"The assets 
and liabilities acquired are carried at fair value at the time of acquisition."
"Any positive difference between the 
purchase cost and the pro rata net assets of the acquired company is reported as goodwill under intangible assets."
Any badwill is recognized in other operating income.
"The cost of the acquired subsidiary equals the fair values of 
the assets given, liabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for the 
acquisition."
Any acquisition-related costs incurred are recognized as other operating expenses.
"Joint ventures and associates – Jointly controlled entities in which Rheinmetall has rights to the net assets of the 
investee (joint ventures) are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method."
"Entities 
over which Rheinmetall can exert significant influence (associates) are also recognized using the equity method."
"On first-time inclusion, based on the cost at the time the investment interest is acquired, the respective investment 
carrying amount is increased or decreased by changes in equity of the joint venture or associate to the extent 
these can be attributed to equity interest of the Rheinmetall Group."
"Goodwill for these investments is calculated 
in line with the principles applying to full consolidation."
"Any resulting goodwill is included in the investment 
carrying amount."
"If there are intercompany profits from transactions between the Rheinmetall Group and the joint 
venture or associate, these are eliminated on a pro rata basis."
"Joint operations – In joint operations, the jointly controlling parties have rights to the assets and liabilities of the 
joint arrangement."
"In the consolidated financial statements, the assets, liabilities, expenses and income 
attributable to the jointly controlling parties are recognized pro rata."
"The disposals of fully consolidated subsidiaries from the scope of 
consolidation are attributable to three sales."
"In fiscal 2023, the scope of consolidation was expanded by three additions to joint operations in the form of newly 
founded entities."
"With regard to the investments accounted for using the equity method, one joint venture and one associate were 
founded."
Two associates left the scope of consolidation by way of the sale of shares.
"Further information can be 
found under »note (8) “Discontinued operations”."
"The companies included in the consolidated financial statements and all shareholdings in accordance with 
section 313(2) HGB are listed in the list of shareholdings under »note (43) of the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"(7) Material acquisitions 
Acquisition of ammunition manufacturer Expal Systems S.A.U."
"– On July 31, 2023, Rheinmetall AG acquired 100% 
of the shares in Expal Systems S.A.U., a Spanish ammunition manufacturer, for a provisional purchase price of 
€1.2 billion."
"The purchase price was paid in July 2023 in cash and through the assumption of cash pool liabilities 
of MaxamCorp."
"The contractually agreed process between Rheinmetall and Maxam 
to determine the final purchase price was completed at the start of fiscal 2024."
"This resulted in a purchase price 
adjustment of €20 million, which is to be paid in cash."
"The obligation to pay this amount was recognized in fiscal 
2023 as an adjusting event after the reporting period."
The acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U.
"serves to further increase Rheinmetall’s production capacity in the area 
of large- and medium-caliber ammunition and to expand its product range."
"Thanks to Expal’s technologies and 
order backlog, the transaction will also help to secure Rheinmetall’s core business in the area of weapons, 
ammunition and propulsion systems in the long term."
"The valuation techniques used to value intangible assets were specified to 
ensure a more appropriate determination of fair value."
"Furthermore, the parameters on which the valuation was 
based were adjusted to reflect the updated estimates."
"In particular, the adjusted purchase price allocation led to 
an increase in intangible assets amounting to €284 million."
"In addition, the final purchase price adjustment 
agreed at the start of fiscal 2024 was already taken into account."
"Various assessment procedures were used to determine the fair value of the material assets acquired:  
Intangible assets – determined in particular with the help of the residual value method but also using the relief-
from-royalty method."
"The residual value method takes into account the present value of the net cash flows 
generated by the intangible asset to be assessed."
"As intangible assets often only generate cash flows in 
combination with other assets, the relevant cash surpluses are adjusted to take cash flows resulting from the 
supporting assets into account."
"When the relief-from-royalty method is applied, the fair value is calculated as the 
present value of the anticipated savings in license payments."
"Property, plant and equipment – determined based on market comparison methods and cost methods."
"Where 
available, market prices for similar assets and, if necessary, amortized replacement costs that reflect adjustments 
for physical deterioration, functional or economic obsolescence, are used."
Inventories – determined using market comparison methods.
"With these methods, the fair value is determined 
based on an estimated sales price under normal business conditions less the expected completion and selling 
costs and appropriate profit margins."
"The goodwill of €644 million resulting from the acquisition is justified by the strong market position and high 
profitability of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"and the synergy effects that are expected to be generated as a result of the 
acquisition."
"The goodwill, which is not tax-deductible, was allocated to Weapon and Ammunition."
"€2 million of this 
relates to fiscal 2022 and €1 million to fiscal 2023."
"These costs are reported in the income statement under other 
operating expenses."
"In the period from August 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, Expal generated sales of €171 million, €58 million of 
which was attributable to intragroup sales."
"Expal therefore contributed sales of €112 million and an operating 
result of €37 million to the consolidated result in this period."
"If the acquisition had already been concluded on January 1, 2023, consolidated sales as of December 31, 2023 
would have amounted to €7,380 million and the operating result would have been €983 million."
"(8) Discontinued operations 
As part of the realignment of the Rheinmetall Group, the Executive Board decided to sell the Pistons business unit, 
classified as a non-core business."
"Since May 1, 2021, the business unit – which primarily comprises the small- 
and large-bore pistons business of the former Hardparts division – has been classified as held for sale and 
recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation."
"The earnings after taxes of the 
discontinued business unit are recognized in the separate item “Earnings from discontinued operations” in the 
income statement."
"In addition to the original goal of handing over the small- and large-bore pistons business to new owners in its 
entirety, from the beginning of fiscal 2022 Rheinmetall also considered offers for individual investments or parts 
of companies belonging to the discontinued operation."
"In the second half of 2022, the large-bore pistons business 
was ultimately sold to the Swedish group Koncentra Verkstads AB, Gothenburg."
"The share purchase agreement 
covered Rheinmetall’s large-bore pistons business with three production plants in Germany, the US and China as 
well as a steel pistons line from the small-bore pistons plant in Marinette, US."
"The transaction was closed on 
January 27, 2023 and included the deconsolidation of the Group companies belonging to the large-bore pistons 
business."
The deconsolidation gain based on the final purchase price is €14 million.
"Following the separate sale of the large-bore pistons business, the Executive Board resolved to further divide the 
remaining business in order to sell it."
"In addition to the large-bore pistons business, one other disposal group and 
three assets in the form of investments were identified for separate sale: the small-bore pistons disposal group 
comprises small-bore pistons production with sites in Europe and North and South America."
"As a result of the change in the sales strategy, Rheinmetall and Riken Corporation, Tokyo, Japan, entered into a 
purchase agreement on March 22, 2023 for all the shares previously held by Rheinmetall in Riken Automobile 
Parts (Wuhan) Co., Ltd."
"The sale of shares was completed on April 5, 2023."
"The transaction did not result in any 
significant deconsolidation result."
"It became apparent in the first half of 2023 that it would not be possible to sell all the shares in the associate 
Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd, India."
"The Rheinmetall Group therefore decided in the third quarter of 2023 to sell 
individual share packages on the Indian stock exchange."
"The schedule for the disposal of the shares in Shriram 
Pistons & Rings Ltd."
"was amended so that share packages will only be offered on the stock exchange if the daily 
updated share prices are favorable for the sale by Rheinmetall."
"As all shares were therefore no longer actively 
offered for immediate sale by the Rheinmetall Group from this date, the requirements for classification as held for 
sale were no longer met for the investment in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
accounted for using the equity method.
"As a result, the investment is likewise no longer part of the discontinued business unit."
"The parties are 
aiming to close the transaction as of March 31, 2024."
"In conjunction with the negotiations, it had already become 
apparent in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 that, contrary to the original goal, the disposal of small-bore pistons 
business would only be possible if the pension obligations due to retirees were excluded."
"The pension obligations due to these pensioners amount to €40 million as of December 31, 2023."
"The other assets and liabilities attributable to the small-bore pistons business and the investments in 
Kolbenschmidt Huayu Piston Co., Ltd."
"are still recognized as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2023 
and reported as a disposal group in light of the imminent sale to a buyer."
"As of 
Decembe  31, 2023, the small-bore pistons business and the investment in Kolbenschmidt Huayu Piston Co., Ltd., 
China, were also written down to fair value less costs to sell."
"This resulted in a reduction in earnings before taxes 
of €63 million and a tax benefit of €9 million."
For the small-bore pistons business and the investment in Kolbenschmidt Huayu Piston Co.
"Ltd., the fair value less 
costs to sell underlying each measurement as of December 31, 2023 was determined on the basis of the 
contractually agreed purchase price and estimates with regard to costs to sell yet to be incurred."
See the explanations under »note (21) Investment Property.
2 The figures for the previous year were restated as a result of the amended schedule for the disposal of the shares in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd.
"The cumulative expenses recognized within equity in other comprehensive income amounted to €106 million as 
of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €92 million)."
"The figure for the previous year restated as a result of the 
amended schedule for the disposal of the shares in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
Sales from the real estate development sector are also recognized in the other companies.
"The following table 
shows the timing of sales recognition broken down by segment."
"Customer contracts in security technology include the manufacture and supply of goods, service contracts for 
service and maintenance activities and the provision of development services."
"Sales are realized at the time of 
transfer of control, which is agreed individually."
"In particular, sales are recognized at a point in time for orders for 
protection and weapon systems and for ammunition."
"In the business areas of civilian mobility, contracts with customers relate primarily to serial deliveries of modules 
and systems for engine technology."
The customers are predominantly large automotive manufacturers.
"As a rule, 
sales are recognized at the time of delivery."
Sales are recognized over time for customer-specific contract manufacturing.
"This predominantly applies to 
contracts with customers in the Electronic Solutions division, to development and pilot production contracts and 
to the delivery of vehicle programs."
"The sales for 2023 include €3 million (previous year: €4 million), which resulted from the inclusion of a financing 
component."
"The credit term for contracts with 
customers is predominantly 90 days."
"Contract assets increased by €154 million as against the previous year to 
€516 million (previous year: €362 million)."
"Contract liabilities result from the excess of advance payments received and other customer payments over the 
performance already rendered."
"Approximately two thirds of contract liabilities included in the items at the 
beginning of the fiscal year were recognized as income in fiscal 2023."
"Contract liabilities increased by 
€1,474 million to €2,594 million (previous year: €1,120 million)."
"Offset costs are usually 
incurred for contracts with customers in which the customer wishes to support the local economy in order to offset 
an import business through an additional agreement."
"Indirect offset costs are costs that are incurred in addition 
to the manufacturing-related costs."
"The assets are recognized at the time the costs arise and are written down in 
line with the sales recognition over the time of contract fulfillment."
"The order backlog as of December 31, 2023 reflects the total of performance obligations not fulfilled or partly not 
yet fulfilled."
"Besides the contract value, the order backlog also includes adjustments from variable remuneration, 
such as index-based price adjustment clauses, which are customary on longer-term orders."
"The performance 
obligations of Sensors and Actuators and Materials and Trade are less than one year and therefore not included in this disclosure."
"Including the respective trade tax gives the recognized total tax rate, 
which in Germany is predominantly 30%."
"At foreign companies, deferred taxes are calculated using country-
specific tax rates, which range from 9% to 34% (previous year: 15% to 34%)."
The table below presents a reconciliation of expected tax expense to reported actual tax expense.
"Rheinmetall 
AG’s tax rate of 30% is applied to earnings before taxes in order to calculate the expected tax expense."
"This 
includes German corporate income tax, the solidarity surcharge and trade tax."
"€140 million (previous year: €162 million) of this relates to German loss carryforwards, €125 million (previous year: 
€127 million) to foreign loss carryforwards and €1 million to tax credits (previous year: €2 million)."
"The German loss 
carryforwards, and €116 million of the foreign loss carryforwards (previous year: €116 million), are not subject to 
expiration."
"As in the previous year, the limited foreign loss carryforwards can still be utilized for up to eight years."
"Within the Group, €40 million (previous year: €24 million) in deferred tax assets were recognized at companies of 
continuing operations with losses in the current year or in the previous year due to positive corporate planning."
"These 
relate in particular to companies with start-up losses and companies at which the business outlook has experienced 
a sustained improvement."
"Deferred tax liabilities of €13 million (previous year: €10 million) were recognized on 
material differences that are not expected to reverse in the near future or for which the Group cannot control the 
reversal."
"The law became effective on December 30, 2023 
and applies to all fiscal years after this date."
"According to this legislation, the parent company in Germany must pay an additional tax on the profits of any of 
its subsidiaries that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15%."
"According to a calculation based on country-
by-country reporting for the Rheinmetall Group, all Group companies are located in countries with effective tax 
rates greater than 15% in 2023, with the exception of Brazil, Czechia, Norway and South Africa."
The Group is currently assessing what impact the domestic and foreign minimum taxation legislation will have.
"With regard to fiscal 2023, approximately 6% of the Rheinmetall Group’s annual profits would have been subject 
to the minimum tax as they were effectively subject to a tax rate of less than 15%."
"Based on the data used and the 
legal status, a seven-figure additional tax expense is to be expected."
"These figures are based on the profits and 
tax expenses identified in preparing the consolidated financial statements."
"It is possible that Rheinmetall would 
still not have to pay any minimum tax in relation to these jurisdictions if the legislation had already been in force 
in 2023."
"This is because the complex adjustments to the calculation required to determine the minimum tax in 
accordance with OECD guidelines could lead to a significantly different result."
"Due to the complexity involved in applying the legislation, the quantitative impact of the legislation that has been 
passed or has entered into force cannot yet be reliably predicted."
"Consequently, the legislation could also have 
tax implications for subsidiaries with an effective tax rate greater than 15%."
"Rheinmetall applies the exemption to IAS 12, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to income 
taxes under Pillar 2 rules are not recognized and information in this regard is not disclosed in the notes."
"As a result of the convertible bond issued 
in February 2023, diluted earnings per share are calculated in addition to basic earnings per share."
"The calculation 
of diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all potentially dilutive instruments are converted 
into ordinary shares at the time of issue, resulting in an increase in the number of shares."
"At the same time, 
earnings after taxes are reduced by the effect on earnings of these instruments, such as interest costs."
"Treasury 
shares reduce the respective weighted number of shares."
"Goodwill is managed at the level of the six divisions of the Rheinmetall Group and tested for impairment at least 
once per year."
"Goodwill recognized for continuing operations was tested for impairment as of December 31, 2023."
"No impairment 
loss was required."
"The impairment test uses the fair value less costs to sell of the cash generating units, which is 
calculated using the discounted cash flow method based on a three-year detailed planning period."
"In the 
Rheinmetall Group, the corporate plan is prepared on the basis of empirical and current forecast data."
"These 
underlying assumptions include intra-Group estimates as well as external sources of information."
"For periods after the detailed planning phase, cash flows are extrapolated from the last planning period, 
taking into account growth rates based on long-term business expectations, which are guided by the long-term 
inflation forecast."
"The measurement of fair value less costs to sell is therefore primarily based on unobservable 
inputs and allocated to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
The discount rates used and the carrying amounts of the goodwill of the six divisions are shown below.
"The prior-
year figures have not been restated to reflect the new Group structure."
"In addition to the impairment test, each cash-generating unit was subjected to sensitivity analyses."
"These 
analyses assumed scenarios based firstly on a 0.5 percentage point higher discount rate after taxes and secondly 
a 0.5 percentage point lower growth rate."
"For further sensitivity, the cash flows used to calculate the terminal value 
were reduced by a flat rate of 10%."
"None of the sensitivity analyses would have resulted in an impairment of the 
recognized goodwill."
"In addition to capitalized development costs of €72 million (previous year: €82 million), €217 million was 
recognized as expenses for research and development costs of continuing operations in 2023 (previous year: 
€209 million)."
"(19) Right-of-use assets 
The capitalized right-of-use assets from leases primarily relate to rented office and production space at various 
locations in Germany and abroad."
"The rental agreements for property usually include options for renewals and 
index-based rent price adjustment clauses."
"No parts of buildings were reclassified to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2023 (previous 
year: carrying amount of €5 million)."
"The reclassification in accordance with IFRS 5 relates to the sale of land from 
a company that is not part of the discontinued operations."
"Investment property has a fair value of €30 million 
(previous year: €35 million)."
"The fair value is calculated on the basis of generally accepted measurement methods 
using multiples."
The methods used come under level 3 of the measurement hierarchy in IFRS 13.
"The objective of the joint venture is to strengthen the 
position on the Chinese market for pumps in the context of automotive applications and other engine parts."
"The 
joint venture KOLBENHÖFE GmbH & Co."
"KG, based in Hamburg, is operated for the purpose of developing and 
constructing as well as marketing and selling land and buildings."
"The associate 4iG operates in the 
telecommunications market and offers IT solutions."
"4iG is listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange and the fair 
value of the share in 4iG was €156 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €134 million)."

"As a result, the shares in this investment accounted for using the equity method are no longer part of 
the discontinued business unit (see the information under »note (8) Discontinued operations)."
"In accordance with 
the requirements of IAS 28, a retrospective at-equity valuation of the investment was therefore calculated from 
the time of its initial classification as held for sale."
"The opening carrying amounts in equity affected as of January 
1, 2022, the carrying amounts as of December 31, 2022 and the previous year’s values in the income statement 
were restated accordingly."
"The effects associated with the at-equity valuation extrapolation are included in the 
result from continued operations."
"Prior to its retrospective application, the at-equity valuation extrapolation was 
suspended in accordance with IFRS 5."
"As the retrospective adjustment did not have any material impact on the 
comparative period from the Rheinmetall Group perspective, a third statement of financial position as of January 
1, 2022 was not presented."
The sale of several share packages caused the interest held by Rheinmetall in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd.
"to fall 
from more than 20% to 3.99% by the end of fiscal 2023."
"Furthermore, Rheinmetall’s co-determination options on 
the Board of Directors of Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
"were restricted by a contractual agreement entered into in 
conjunction with the sale of the small-bore pistons business (see the relevant information under »note (8) 
Discontinued operations)."
"Consequently, the Rheinmetall Group no longer assumes that it can exercise significant 
influence over Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
"and therefore no longer accounts for the investment as an associate 
as of December 31, 2023, but rather as a financial instrument measured at fair value."
"The carrying amount of the 
investment in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
"and the amounts recognized for this investment in other 
comprehensive income were therefore derecognized following this change in status."
"The profit amounting to €31 million from the sale of the share packages is included in the income from investments 
accounted for using the equity method."
"The same applies to the initial assessment of securities at fair value 
(€22 million)."
"However, the impact of the subsequent measurement at fair value of the shares still held by 
Rheinmetall as of December 31, 2023 of €5 million is recognized in other net financial income."
"After taking into 
account the impact of the at-equity valuation of €10 million to be recognized for Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
"and 
the dividend received of €1 million, the total impact on earnings (before taxes) in connection with Shriram Pistons 
& Rings Ltd."
amounts to €69 million in fiscal 2023.
"Please refer to the information under »note (22) Investments 
accounted for using the equity method."
"The unrealized financial income amounted to €4 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €4 million)."
"The increase in the net defined benefit from plan assets is explained under note (28) Provisions for pensions and 
similar obligations."
The contract acquisition costs are explained in »note (9) Sales .
"The subsidies/grants receivable essentially relate to grants paid by public administrative bodies to subsidize the 
in-house development of new technologies."
Prepaid expenses particularly include advance payments for insurance and other services.
The investment was liquidated in 2023.
"The cash received as a result was recognized as part of cash and 
cash equivalents."
The notional value per share is €2.56.
"As a rule, shareholders have pre-emption rights."
"To service the above authorization, the company’s share capital was contingently increased by up to €22,302,080 
by the issue of up to 8,711,750 new no-par bearer shares by way of resolution of the Annual General Meeting on 
May 11, 2021."
"The Executive Board is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the 
further details for the implementation of the contingent capital increase."
"As a rule, shareholders have pre-emption rights to the bonds."
"The authorization to issue bonds with warrants and convertible bonds was partially utilized by the issuance of a 
convertible bond in fiscal 2023 with a total nominal value of €1 billion."
"Capital reserve – The capital reserve includes an amount of €104 million to be assigned to the equity component 
to be recognized in connection with the convertible bond issued by Rheinmetall AG on January 31, 2023."
Transaction costs amounting to €1 million were deducted from the calculated equity component amount.
"Retained earnings – The retained earnings include earnings generated by the Rheinmetall Group in the past less 
profit distributed."
"Treasury shares – By way of resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2021, the Executive Board of the 
company is authorized to acquire treasury shares of the company equivalent to a maximum of 10% of the share 
capital until May 10, 2026."
"The decisive figure for the company’s share capital here is the lowest level either when 
the Annual General Meeting adopted the resolution on this authorization, when this authorization took effect or 
when this authorization was exercised."
"At the discretion of the Executive Board, the shares are acquired (i) via the 
stock exchange, (ii) by way of a public bid directed at all shareholders, (iii) by way of a public invitation to submit 
offers for sale or (iv) by granting put options."
"The further details of any commitments and 
transfers, including any direct consideration, any claim requirements, holding or lock-up periods and 
expiry or compensation rules, especially for special cases such as retirement, disability or death, are 
defined by the Executive Board."
(vi) The treasury shares can be canceled without an additional Annual General Meeting resolution.
"As a rule, 
the cancellation results in a capital reduction."
"In deviation from this, the Executive Board can determine 
that the share capital remains unchanged and the cancellation instead increases the share of the 
remaining shares in the share capital in accordance with section 8(3) AktG."
"In this case, the Executive 
Board is authorized to amend the number of shares stated in the articles of association."
"As in the previous year, no treasury shares were acquired in the reporting year."
"Disposals related to the long-term 
incentive program which is described under »note (36) Share programs."
"Sales proceeds from the disposals are 
used for general financing purposes."
"As of December 31, 2023, the portfolio of treasury shares amounted to 
141,356 shares (previous year: 177,184 shares) with acquisition costs of €5 million (previous year: €6 million)."
"The 
amount of subscribed capital attributable to treasury shares is €362 thousand (previous year: €454 thousand)."
This represents a share in subscribed capital of 0.3% (previous year: 0.4%).
"In fiscal 2023, Rheinmetall AG paid a dividend of €187 million or €4.30  per share (previous year: €143 million or 
€3.30 per share) to its shareholders from current earnings."
"At the Annual General Meeting on May 14, 2024 , the 
Executive Board and Supervisory Board will propose the distribution of a dividend of €5.70 per share to the eligible 
shareholders."
This equates to a dividend payment totaling €247 million.

Capital management – Capital management is geared towards sustainably increasing enterprise value, securing 
sufficient liquidity and preserving the Rheinmetall Group’s credit standing."
"The Group manages and monitors its 
capital structure in order to achieve its business targets regarding operations, necessary capital expenditure and 
strategic acquisitions and to optimize capital costs."
"Debt management pursues a diversified financing strategy to 
guarantee continual access to liquid funds both via money and capital markets and via bank financing."
"The key figures for capital management in the Rheinmetall Group are net financial debts or net liquidity and the 
equity ratio."
"The debt repayment period is also disclosed, which is calculated as the ratio of financial debts to 
EBITDA."
"Further information on the financing strategy and on the asset and capital structure is contained in the combined 
management report."
"(28) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
Rheinmetall’s company pension systems consist of both defined contribution and defined benefit plans."
"Defined contribution plans – Under defined contribution plans, the relevant company pays contributions to 
earmarked pension institutions, which are reported in personnel expenses."
"The company does not enter into any 
further obligations; a provision is not recognized."
"In continuing operations, personnel expenses of €90 million (previous year: €84 million) were incurred in the year 
under review for defined contribution pension commitments, which essentially relate to payments to statutory 
pension institutions in Germany."
"Defined benefit plans – Under its defined benefit plans, Rheinmetall is required to meet confirmed benefit 
obligations to active and former employees."
"There are material pension plans at the Rheinmetall Group’s German and Swiss 
companies and at Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land Ltd."
"Rheinmetall has restructured the defined benefit plan for Group companies based in Germany effective 
January 1, 2022."
"It comprises a basic plan and a corporate performance-related intermediate plan, each of which 
is financed by the employer, and a supplementary plan financed through deferred compensation."
"The 
supplementary plan is subsidized by an employer contribution of 20% to the deferred compensation amount (for 
deferred compensation up to 4% of the “West” assessment ceiling in the statutory pension scheme)."
"The 
respective plan components are paid into a fund managed by a trustee."
"The beneficiaries are entitled to the 
amounts derived from the plan assets."
There is also a nominal contribution guarantee.
"The agreed retirement 
benefits comprise old-age pensions, invalidity pensions and pensions for surviving dependents."
"The pension 
capital is paid out in the form of a life-long pension, payment in installments over 10 years, or a lump sum."
"As 
agreed, the life-long pension and the payment in installments are increased by 1% each year."
"The agreed 
retirement benefits comprise old-age pensions, invalidity pensions and pensions for surviving dependents."
"The 
annual pension contribution or the amount of deferred compensation for each beneficiary in accordance with 
actuarial principles is converted into a capital component."
"The total pension capital when benefits become due is 
based on the sum of all capital components."
"For the basic plan and intermediate plan, pension capital is paid out 
in the form of a life-long pension that increases by 1% each year in accordance with an agreement."
"For the 
supplementary plan financed solely by the employee, the pension capital is paid out as a lump sum or in three or 
five equal installments when benefits become due."
"When the new plan was introduced, the previous plan was 
converted to the new pension plan."
The entitlements from the previous pension plan remain in place.
"Other pension plans exist in Germany, but these are no longer available to new employees joining the Group."
"The 
agreed retirement benefits comprise old-age pensions, invalidity pensions and pensions for surviving 
dependents."
"Depending on the plan, these are based on agreed fixed amounts per year of service or on a 
percentage of the employee’s final salary before leaving the Rheinmetall Group."
"Ongoing retirement benefits are 
subject to compensation for inflation."
The pension obligations of the German companies are largely financed internally.
"Rheinmetall has set up a 
contractual trust arrangement (CTA) with the aim of spreading the financing of its pension and partial retirement 
obligations across several pillars over the long term."
"For continuing operations, a total of €262 million has been 
paid into a fund managed by a trustee since 2016, €247 million of which was allocated to pension obligations and 
€16 million to partial retirement obligations."
"Pension payments to the beneficiaries are made by the respective 
Group companies."
"There are pension plans at the Swiss subsidiaries, each of which is managed via pension funds for several 
companies (multi-employer plans)."
"These are defined benefit plans used to cover pensions and risks arising from 
invalidity and death for former employees, their relatives and surviving dependents."
"On retirement, the pension is 
based on the available retirement assets multiplied by conversion rates determined by pension fund regulations, 
whereby payment can take place monthly or in certain cases as a lump sum."
"Pension plans are financed by 
contributions made by the employer and employee, primarily at a rate of 50% each, which are paid into pension 
funds."
"The pension funds are independent foundations that do not belong to the Rheinmetall Group, whose funds 
are due solely to pension beneficiaries."
"Any return of assets and income to the contributing companies is 
excluded."
"The top bodies in the foundations comprise equal numbers of employer and employee representatives 
of the relevant companies."
The foundations are responsible for investments.
"Principles of security, risk 
distribution, yield and liquidity must be observed in this process in order to be able to render the agreed benefits 
from the foundation’s assets when due."
"Both contributions paid into the pension funds and future benefits arising 
from these are reviewed regularly by the foundation’s bodies and may be changed after taking into account the 
foundation’s financial options."
"In the event of a shortage of cover, the pension funds can levy remedial 
contributions from all associated employers if other measures do not lead to the desired result."
"Liability of the 
Swiss subsidiaries towards the companies belonging to the pension funds is excluded."
The acquisition of the shares in Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land Ltd.
"requires Rheinmetall to make payments to the 
BAE Group’s pension fund for the entitlements earned by the acquired employees."
"It is not possible to withdraw 
from the pension fund."
If the recognized pension obligations of Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land Ltd.
"that are not 
covered by plan assets, Rheinmetall a claim to reimbursement from the BAE Group in the same amount (see »note 
(24) Other Assets), which compensates for the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability from pensions."
"In addition, the BAE Group is obliged to make the ongoing pension payments to retirees."
"Excess or deficient cover 
of the pension fund and its performance are therefore neutral in terms of earnings and risk."
"By acquiring the 
shares, Rheinmetall took on full joint liability for the BAE Group’s pension agreements."
"The occurrence of a liability 
claim is considered to be highly unlikely."
"The change essentially results from the reclassification of pension provisions from discontinued 
operations to continuing operations for the first time as of September 30, 2023."
"In conjunction with negotiations 
with potential buyers of the small-bore pistons business at this time, it became apparent that, contrary to the 
original goal, the disposal of small-bore pistons business would only be possible if the pension obligations due 
to retirees were excluded."
"This was confirmed with the signing of the contract for the sale of the small-bore pistons 
business (see the information under »note (8) Discontinued operations)."
"The pension obligations due to these 
pensioners amount to €40 million as of December 31, 2023."
"The changes in financial assumptions and the experience adjustments in the actuarial losses arose across all 
companies."
"The actuarial losses from the change in financial assumptions in fiscal 2023 essentially result from 
lower discount rates."
"At the Swiss companies, the value of the plan assets exceeds the present value of the DBO."
"As of December 31, 
2023, excess cover of the present value of the DBO due to an asset ceiling results in a partial asset ceiling (previous 
year: full asset ceiling)."
"As a result, a net defined benefit from plan assets is reported under other non-current non-
financial receivables as of December 31, 2023 (see »note (24) Other Assets) (previous year: no net asset 
recognized)."
"This development is due to the lower yield curve compared to the previous year and the associated 
expectation of being able to reduce contributory payments in the future."
"In the United Kingdom, the asset ceiling 
again resulted in a full asset ceiling as it did in the previous year."
"As Rheinmetall has no claim to reimbursements 
from the excess cover of the pension plans in the United Kingdom and the future contributions to the plans must 
not be reduced as a result of the excess cover, the asset value must be limited."
The service cost and the balance of entry/leaving benefits are reported under personnel expenses.
The interest expense and interest income from pensions are netted in net interest income.
Employers and employees made total payments of €46 million to plan assets (previous year: €88 million).
"€19 
million (previous year: €62 million) of this relates to the allocation to CTA assets for pension obligations in 
Germany."
"Key pension plans – The statements below refer to the pension plans of Group companies based in Germany, 
Switzerland and the UK."
Rheinmetall is obliged to pay into a pension fund for these employees.
"The average durations of pension obligations are 13 years (previous year: 17 years) at the German companies, 
13 years (previous year: 13 years) at the companies in the United Kingdom and 10 years (previous year: 10 years) 
at companies based in Switzerland."
"In order to determine the present value of the DBO in due consideration of actuarial factors, measurement 
assumptions were made according to standard principles and per country, taking into account the respective 
economic circumstances."
"Discount rates are derived from yields on fixed-interest corporate bonds with a suitable 
duration and currency which are rated “AA” or better."
"To determine the discount rate for Germany, a more detailed 
granular approach is used (often also called the “spot-rate approach”)."
"This means that both the contractual 
obligation of the weighted defined benefit obligation as well as the current service cost and the net interest 
expense are calculated using the entire yield curve of the Group’s actuary as of December 31, 2023."
"The sensitivities were calculated using 
the same methods as the recognized provisions."
"The ranges used for the calculation of the sensitivities are based 
on the changes considered possible by the end of the next reporting period on the basis of historical experience."
"These methods could be limited by the significance of historical experience for the projection of future 
developments and the disregard for effects of simultaneous changes in several parameters."
"Pension commitments 
in Switzerland are excluded from changes in the present value of the DBO based on assumptions on pension 
development, as the pension funds’ regulations do not stipulate ongoing adjustment to future pensions."
"Instead, 
the foundation board decides on any adjustments."
"As well as 
general actuarial risks arising from the measurement of pension obligations, the plan assets harbor investment 
risks."
"The investment strategy and composition of assets managed by pension funds are geared towards yield 
targets, risk tolerance and short-term and medium-term liquidity requirements."
The fair values of property are not based on market prices in an active market.
"For the following year, the estimated cash outflows of continuing operations for contributions to plan assets are 
shown below."
"Provisions for restructuring mainly relate to termination settlements and expenses for partial retirement 
obligations."
"Miscellaneous provisions relate to environmental risks at €24 million (previous year: €27 million), rebates and 
bonuses at €19 million (previous year: €19 million) as well as other individual provisions."
"The first tranche, maturing on February 7, 2028, has an annual coupon 
of 1.875%."
"The second tranche with an annual coupon of 2.250% matures on February 7, 2030."
"With 
the exception of liabilities that have priority by law, the convertible bond is unsecured and is ranked equally with 
all other current and future unsecured and non-subordinated liabilities of Rheinmetall AG."
"When the convertible 
bond was issued in February 2023, €104 million (after deferred taxes) relating to the conversion right was 
recognized in capital reserves."
"The liability component of the convertible bond is recognized at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method."
"The carrying amount of this liability was €897 million as of December 31, 2023."
"Promissory note loans – As of the end of the reporting period, there are various promissory note loans with a 
nominal value totaling €428 million that serve the Group’s general corporate financing."
Liabilities to banks of €12 million (previous year: €21 million) are secured by land charges and similar rights.
"The 
carrying amount of the secured assets is described under »note (20) Property, plant and equipment."
"Commercial paper – There are various commercial paper instruments with a nominal value of €215 million in total 
that serve the Group’s general corporate financing as of the end of the reporting period."
The cash and non-cash changes in financial debts are shown below.
"at the start of fiscal 2024 for the acquisition of ammunition manufacturer Expal Systems 
S.A.U."
Please refer to the information under »note (7) Material acquisitions.
"Cash changes for investments in consolidated companies and other financial assets amounted to €1,064 million 
(previous year: €205 million)."
"€1,058 million of this relates to the acquisition of ammunition manufacturer Expal 
Systems S.A.U., Madrid/Spain."
"A cash inflow of €2 million resulted from the addition of cash and cash equivalents 
from the Expal companies."
"A repayment of €4 million is attributable to a subsequent purchase price adjustment 
for the acquisition in 2022 of the activities of the drone manufacturer EMT Ingenieurgesellschaft Dipl.-Ing."
"Hartmut 
Euer mbH (EMT) by Rheinmetall Technical Publications GmbH."
"A purchase price payment of €10 million is 
attributable to the acquisition in 2022 of 40% of the shares in the associate blackned GmbH."
"Payments for divestments in consolidated companies and other financial assets amount to €155 million (previous 
year: €2 million)."
"€59 million of this in total is attributable to the sale of the large-bore pistons business to the 
Swedish group Koncentra, €74 million of which represents the purchase price payment and €15 million the 
disposal of cash and cash equivalents of the large-bore pistons companies."
"€78 million relates to the sale of the 
share packages of the shares in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd., New Delhi, India."
"The sale of the shares in the 
associate Riken Automobile Parts (Wuhan) Co., Ltd., Wuhan/China, resulted in a payment of €19 million."
"The cash changes in fund units of €130 million result from the reversal of the investment of cash and cash 
equivalents as securities held for trading (strategic liquidity reserve) on the capital market."
"(33) Notes to the segment report 
The Vehicle Systems division was split to create the Vehicle Systems Europe and Vehicle Systems International 
divisions effective October 1, 2023."
"The Vehicle Systems Europe division primarily focuses on the European market 
without UK, while the Vehicles Systems International division concentrates on the markets of Australia, the US 
and the UK."
"Following the change to the Group structure as of October 1, 2023, Rheinmetall’s organizational 
structure comprises six divisions that are managed directly by the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG."
"For the 
purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the two new divisions Vehicle Systems Europe and 
Vehicle Systems International are combined into one segment."
"This summary is based on the expectation that 
both divisions will achieve similar gross margins and report similar sales trends over the long term."
"The divisions 
are also very similar with regard to other factors such as their market position, the type of products and production 
processes, production conditions, their customers, the sales methods used and the regulatory environment."
"The five segments – Vehicle Systems, Weapon and Ammunition, Electronic Solutions, Sensors and Actuators, and

"The market value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is determined on the basis of input 
factors observed directly or indirectly on the market (level 2)."
"The foreign exchange rates applicable at the end of 
the reporting period and the yield curves are key inputs in calculating the fair value of derivatives for currency 
hedges."
The discounted cash flow method is used for currency swaps and currency forwards.
"The fair value of the 
commodity futures is derived from the market price as of the measurement date."
"Fund units held for trading were 
measured at the market value for each asset class until the reversal of the investment."
"The other financial assets 
measured at fair value through profit or loss include the shares in Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd."
"As these are traded 
on the Indian stock exchange, the input factors can be directly observed on the market (Level 1)."
"Please refer to 
the information under »note (24) Other Assets."
"The net result from financial assets and liabilities allocated to the 
category at fair value through profit or loss amounted to income of €4 million (previous year: loss of €35 million)."
"For financial assets and liabilities not allocated to a measurement category in accordance with IFRS 9, this resulted 
in income of €1 million (previous year: income of €18 million)."
"The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments that are measured at amortized cost and whose 
carrying amounts do not approximate fair value are shown below."
"The fair value of the promissory note loans and the other financial debts was determined by 
discounting the associated future cash flows at rates that match the time to maturity of similar debts."
"Sale of customer receivables – As part of financial risk management, sales of receivables are carried out on a 
situational basis as part of supplier finance solutions, forfeiting or comparable instruments."
"Financial risks – The operations and financing transactions of the Rheinmetall Group as an international group 
are exposed to financial market risks, mainly from liquidity, counterparty default, electricity, gas and commodity 
prices, exchange rate volatility and interest rate changes."
"In accordance with the Group-wide risk management 
system of Rheinmetall AG, such risks are not only identified, analyzed and measured, but also managed by taking 
actions to avoid, contain or limit such risks."
"Inherent financial risks are actively managed to ensure that no 
significant risks arise from financial instruments as of the end of the reporting period."
"Derivative financial instruments – Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce currency and commodity 
price risks."
"If the value changes of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are not recognized in profit and 
loss at the same time and the necessary conditions are met, changes in the fair value of hedging transactions are 
recognized in the hedge reserve in the context of cash flow hedge accounting."
"The effectiveness of these 
transactions is subject to ongoing monitoring, using the critical terms match method prospectively."
"Ineffective 
portions to be recognized are determined using the dollar offset testing method."
"The table below shows the fair value of all hedges accounted for as financial assets or financial liabilities as of the 
end of the reporting period."
"For derivatives in hedge accounting, the nominal volumes for currency and commodity hedges are shown below."
"For significant currency pairs and commodity hedges, the average hedging rates are also shown."
"Currency risk – Owing to the international nature of the Rheinmetall Group’s business, certain operational 
currency risks arise from the fluctuating exchange rates between the functional currencies of Group companies 
and other currencies."
"Open positions exposed to a currency risk are hedged through derivatives, generally 
currency forwards and swaps."
"Where legally possible, foreign exchange trading is contracted exclusively with 
Rheinmetall AG."
"Here, currency hedge transactions are concluded with subsidiaries and squared either directly or 
in a portfolio approach via banks."
"The most important currency hedges in the Group refer to Swiss franc, US dollar, 
Australian dollar, pound sterling and South African rand transactions."
"These hedges are measured as of the end 
of the reporting period and recognized at fair value calculated according to the discounted cash flow method."
"Commodity price risks – The Rheinmetall Group is exposed to price volatility risks from the procurement of 
commodities, such as metals."
"By means of materials cost escalator agreements with customers, the major part of 
these risks from volatile metal prices is shifted to customers, albeit with a time lag."
"Moreover, the Sensors and 
Actuators and Materials and Trade divisions (where most of these risks exist) have also used derivative financial 
instruments for risk management, mainly swaps maturing by 2026 at the latest contracted on the basis of a 
financial settlement."
The maximum risk is the carrying amount recognized.
"In order to minimize the default 
risk with derivative financial instrument contracts, the Rheinmetall Group sets high requirements in respect of its 
counterparties, restricting itself exclusively to banks with impeccable ratings."
"The Rheinmetall Group monitors and tracks the default risk on customer receivables at the level of its operating 
units in line with the corporate policies for proper debtor management."
"Individual assessments (where 
appropriate, based on current trends and qualitative information) can be used in addition to database-supported 
rating and default data of an external data supplier."
Current del credere risks are covered by valuation allowances.
There are no significant valuation allowances for customer receivables at the Rheinmetall Group.
"Given the type 
of business and the customer structure, default rarely occurs and instead there are only delays in payment."
"There 
were no other material impairments not recognized on the basis of collateral."
"In addition, potential default risks 
are assessed on an individual basis in connection with long-term orders and reduced or hedged by means of 
prepayments, credit insurance, guarantees or letters of credit."
"The risk provision for general default risk calculated 
according to the simplified approach for the measurement of trade receivables amounted to €18 million in 2023 
(previous year: €19 million)."
"€4 million of this relates to receivables more than 180 days past due (previous year: 
€4 million)."
"The risk calculated using business model-specific default rates for receivables up to 30 days past due 
is less than 0.8% (previous year: less than 1.2%)."
"As of the end of the reporting period, there were no indications 
that the debtors of any receivables past due will fail to make payment."
"Because of the customer structure, the risk 
does not significantly increase even when the receivables are a long time past due."
"For 
further details of such credit facilities, see the “Financing” section of the management report."
"The undiscounted contractually agreed payments from repayment and interest components in connection with 
financial debts and derivative financial instruments as of the end of the reporting period are listed below."
"The derivatives would produce a cash outflow at the amount shown 
above only if they were terminated early."
"The Rheinmetall Group’s financial resources comprise cash, cash equivalents, financial current assets available 
for sale and the cash provided by operating activities."
"By contrast, the capital requirements cover the redemption 
of financial liabilities (principal and interest), capital expenditure and the funds for the ongoing financing of 
operating activities."
"(36) Share programs 
In fiscal 2023, the expense for share-based payment for the Rheinmetall Group totaled €23 million (previous year: 
€23 million)."
"€17 million (previous year: €17 million) of this is attributable to equity-settled commitments and €6 
million (previous year: €6 million) to cash-settled commitments."
"As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of 
Rheinmetall Group’s liabilities recognized for share-based payments was €12 million (previous year: €6 million) 
and related entirely to cash-settled commitments."
"Long-term incentive program – There is a long-term incentive remuneration program (LTI) for the managers of the 
Rheinmetall Group in order to involve management in the company’s long-term development."
"Under this program, 
the beneficiaries are paid performance-related remuneration for the past fiscal year in the subsequent year."
"The 
calculation of the amount of remuneration is based on the average adjusted EBT of the Rheinmetall Group for the 
past three fiscal years, capped at a maximum of €400 million."
"The individual remuneration is the result of 
multiplying this amount by a personal factor in line with the individual arrangement."
"The remuneration for German managers is measured according to the respective assessment basis, with 40% and 
60% being settled in shares and cash respectively."
"Managers working outside Germany receive remuneration of 
50% of the determined assessment basis in shares."
"The number of shares granted is determined in the subsequent year on the basis of the average price on the last 
five trading days in February of a year (reference price) with a deduction of 20% (relevant share value)."
"The portion 
of the assessment basis to be granted in shares is divided by the relevant share value to determine the number of 
shares to be granted."
The shares granted are subject to a lock-up period of four years.
"If employment is terminated 
by the employer, the manager receives remuneration pro rata for each completed calendar month of employment."
"For the Executive Board of the Rheinmetall Group, the LTI was replaced by LTI 2.0 from fiscal 2022."
"For two members of the Executive Board, part of the LTI remuneration also resulted from 
the average monthly total shareholder return (TSR) of the company’s grant year as a proportion of the average 
monthly TSR of the MDAX."
"The remuneration for members of the Executive Board comprised a component settled 
in shares of 50% of the assessment basis and a cash component of 60% of the assessment basis."
"When 
determining the number of shares granted, there was no 20% deduction from the reference price."
"An expense of €13 million (previous year: €13 million) was recognized for the LTI program (not including LTI 2.0) 
in fiscal 2023."
The reference price in March 2023 was €254.80.
"For fiscal 2022, a total of 35,828 shares were transferred to the 
entitled participants of the LTI program on March 23, 2023 (previous year: a total of 78,017 shares were transferred 
for fiscal 2021 on March 25, 2022)."
"The shares attributable to the Executive Board members are presented in the remuneration report included in the 
combined management report."
"Long-term incentive program 2.0 – A new long-term incentive program (LTI 2.0) was introduced for members of 
the Executive Board from fiscal 2022, which grants virtual shares, referred to below as performance share units 
(PSUs)."
"On the basis of an individual target amount, at the allocation date the beneficiaries are promised a special 
payment depending on the share price performance of Rheinmetall AG."
The PSUs have a vesting period of one fiscal year.
"The waiting period until the payment of the cash amount is four 
years, beginning at the allocation date (“performance period”)."
"At the end of the performance period, the final 
number and the value of the performance shares are determined depending on the achievement of the pre-defined 
performance targets total shareholder return (TSR), return on capital employed (ROCE) and environmental, social 
and governance (ESG)."
"The TSR and ROCE performance targets each account for 40% and the ESG performance 
target 20% of the conditionally allocated PSUs."
"If the target achievement of one of the performance targets falls 
below the limits defined on commitment, the number of PSU attributable to that performance target is reduced to 
zero."
"If one or all of the performance targets are exceeded, the number of PSUs attributable to those performance 
targets increases to a maximum of 200% of the number originally allocated."
"The entitlement to cash payment is determined by multiplying the average closing price of the share of Rheinmetall 
AG on 30 trading days before the end of the performance period by the number of PSUs finally allocated."
"The size 
of this payment amount is capped at 2.5 times the individually stipulated target amount."
A Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine fair value.
"Among other things, the model considers the above 
vesting conditions, the terms and the share price performance of Rheinmetall AG."
"A total liability 
of €12 million (previous year: €6 million) was recognized as of December 31, 2023."
"The program comprises two elements: a monthly basic savings plan 
and a monthly extra savings plan."
"Under the basic savings plan, employees can acquire Rheinmetall shares for a 
monthly sum of at least €30 up to a maximum of €100."
"Rheinmetall contributes 30% of the defined savings 
amount."
"For example, a monthly savings amount of €100 comprises €70 from the employee and the employer’s 
contribution of €30."
"In addition, employees can acquire additional Rheinmetall shares as part of the extra savings plan."
"Here, the 
monthly savings contribution can amount to up to 10% of the annual gross salary divided by 12."
"There is a cap of 
€900 per month."
"Here, too, Rheinmetall contributes 30% of the defined savings amount."
"In 2023, employees acquired a total of 47,818 shares (previous year: 66,905 shares) under this share purchase 
program."
The employer contribution amounted to €4 million (previous year: €3 million).
"The shares acquired under 
the share purchase program within a year are subject to a lock-up period of two years starting on January 1 of the 
following year."

"In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities 
and risks of future development."
"Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the 
content of the combined corporate governance statement referred to above, including the further reporting 
on corporate governance included therein."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to 
the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in 
accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU 
Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements and 
principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and of the Combined Management Report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the 
group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional 
law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit 
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters."
"In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill 
2."
"Revenue recognition over a period of time  
3."
Accounting treatment of the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U.
"Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows: 
a) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements) 
b) auditor’s response 
2."
"Recoverability of goodwill 
a) In the consolidated financial statements of Rheinmetall Aktiengesellschaft, an amount of €1,125 million is 
recognized as goodwill under the corresponding item of the consolidated statement of financial position (9.6% 
of total assets)."
"Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year or if there is any indication that the item 
may be impaired."
"In these impairment tests, the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units are compared 
with their respective recoverable amount which is determined based on the fair value less cost of sale."
"For this 
purpose, the expected future cash flows are discounted using a discounted cash flow method."
"The cash flow 
projections are based on the corporate planning for the upcoming period of three years valid at the time the 
impairment test is carried out, with expectations on future market developments and country-specific 
assumptions being also taken into account."
"Planning periods further in the future from which a significant 
portion of the fair value less costs to sell results (perpetuity phase) are included by extrapolating the cash 
flows, taking account of a growth rate."
"The cash flows are discounted using the weighted average cost of capital 
of the respective cash-generating unit."
The divisions of the Group were identified as cash-generating units.
"The goodwill previously recognized at the 
level of the Vehicle Systems division was reallocated to the two new cash-generating units Vehicle Systems 
Europe and Vehicle Systems International based on the relative values when the division was split on 
September 30, 2023."
No need for impairment was determined in the reporting year.
"The outcome of these impairment tests is highly dependent on the executive board’s assessment of the future 
cash flows and on the discount rate used and is therefore subject to great uncertainty."
"Therefore, this matter 
was of particular significance in the scope of our audit."
"For information provided by the Company on goodwill, please refer to the sections “Accounting policies” and 
“Goodwill, other intangible assets” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"For the purpose of risk assessment, we obtained an overview of the business development of 
the divisions in the reporting year and assessed to what extent the valuation could be influenced by 
subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors."
"We examined whether the corporate planning underlying 
the impairment tests is consistent with the corporate planning prepared by the executive board and 
acknowledged by the supervisory board."
"In assessing the quality and reliability of the corporate planning, we 
compared the planning of the previous fiscal years with the results that were actually realized and analyzed 
any deviations (adherence to the plan)."
"Together with the persons in charge, we discussed the assumptions 
and premises underlying the planning and examined them for plausibility."
"For this purpose, we, among other 
things, reconciled the assumptions made with macroeconomic and industry-specific market expectations."
"We 
also assessed whether the future cash flows had been appropriately derived from the assumptions and 
premises made."
"In addition, our audit included an examination of whether the cost of group functions has 
been properly considered in the impairment testing of the respective cash-generating units."
"We audited the 
reallocation of the goodwill previously recognized at the level of the Vehicle Systems division to the two new 
cash-generating units Vehicle Systems Europe and Vehicle Systems International based on calculations of the 
relative values."
"In each case, we assessed the appropriateness of calculation of the measurement scheme for 
determining the recoverable amount."
"Furthermore, due to the material significance of goodwill for the Group’s 
assets and liabilities, we performed a complementary sensitivity analysis in order to be able to assess a 
possible impairment risk in case of a potential change of material assumptions concerning the valuation 
parameters."
"In the case of estimates made by the legal representatives, we assessed the reasonableness of 
the methods applied, the assumptions made, and the data used."
"In addition, we audited the completeness and correctness of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements required under IAS 36."
"A material part of the activities in the business with security 
technology is realized under long-term customer-specific agreements."
"The balance sheet as at December 31, 
2023, shows contract assets and contract liabilities of €516 million and €2,594 million, respectively."
"Revenue 
from long-term customer-specific agreements is generally recognized over the period in which the relevant 
asset was created unless the Rheinmetall Group has an alternative possibility to use the asset and is legally 
entitled to receive payment for the services already rendered."
"Also, if an asset is created or enhanced and the 
customer gains control over the asset as the asset is created or enhanced, revenue is recognized over a period 
of time."
"When recognizing revenue over a period of time, revenue is recognized according to the percentage of 
completion, which is calculated as the ratio of the actually incurred contract cost to the estimated total cost to 
complete the contract."
"From our point of view, recognizing revenue over a period of time is subject to a considerable risk of material 
misstatements due to fraud or error and is therefore of particular importance in the context of our audit."
"Estimates by the management have a significant impact on the determination of the percentage of completion, 
the expected total cost, and the cost of orders that is still to be incurred until completion, including any contract 
risks and their probability of occurrence."
"b) During our audit, we consulted the parts of the underlying contracts relevant to accounting and evaluated the 
process of proper identification of the performance obligation and classification of satisfying the performance 
obligation over a given period of time."
"For the purpose of risk assessment, we obtained an overview of the 
business development in the reporting year and assessed to what extent the revenue recognition could be 
influenced by subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors."
"Based on the understanding we have 
obtained of the processes, we evaluated the design of identified internal controls relevant to the audit and 
ascertained whether they had been established."
"We focused our audit of these control procedures on the 
controls for approval of the project valuation taking into account the percentage of completion and the 
projected project margin."
"To the extent that we relied on identified controls, we also assessed the effectiveness 
of those controls."
"We evaluated the appropriateness of the project calculation and the assessment of the percentage of 
completion by means of long-term customer-specific agreements that were selected based on risk-based 
aspects."
"The key criteria for the selection of our project spot checks were the amount of the total contract value 
and of the contract volume, the revenue realized with the project in the year under review, as well as the 
development of the project margin or its amount in the year under review."
"In addition, some contracts were 
randomly selected on a sample basis."
"Moreover, we reconstructed the proper recognition and netting of direct cost as well as the 
amount and netting of overheads."
"In the case of estimates made by the management, we assessed the 
reasonableness of the methods applied, the assumptions made, and the data used."
"In addition, we audited the completeness and correctness of the corresponding disclosures in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements."
Accounting treatment of the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U.
"a) The acquisition of the Spanish munitions manufacturer Expal Systems S.A.U., Madrid, Spain, that was agreed 
with MaxamCorp Holding S.L., Madrid, Spain, was completed on July 31, 2023."
"The purchase agreement for the 
acquisition of all shares had already been signed by both parties in November of the previous year."
"With this 
acquisition, the Rheinmetall Group is particularly aiming to increase its available production capacity in the 
areas of artillery, mortar and medium-caliber ammunition and to expand its product portfolio."
"The acquired 
company will in future operate as Rheinmetall Expal Munitions S.A.U."
"and has been allocated to the Weapon 
and Ammunition division."
"The provisional purchase price due on completion of the acquisition amounts to 
€1.2 billion."
"The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at the acquisition date at the fair values 
determined in a purchase price allocation by an external expert commissioned by Rheinmetall."
"Intangible 
assets totaling €615 million were recognized in this purchase price allocation, €439 million of which was 
attributable to the authorization granted by the Spanish government for the possession and processing of 
explosive substances."
"In addition, hidden reserves were identified in the acquired company’s non-current 
assets in a considerably lower amount."
"The portion of the purchase price that was not allocated to the assets 
and liabilities in the purchase price allocation amounts to €644 million and is recognized as goodwill in the 
statement of financial position."
The accounting treatment of the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U.
"was particularly important in the context 
of our audit, as no market values were available for the identified intangible assets in particular, meaning that 
complex, assumption-based valuation models and methods were used to determine their fair values."
"The 
result of the valuation is highly dependent on the forecast of future cash flows and the discount rates used 
and is subject to uncertainty due to the scope of discretion for the executive board."
"In addition, there is a risk 
that the disclosures in the notes required under IFRS 3 may not be complete or correct."

The company’s disclosures on the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U."
"are included in the section “Material 
acquisitions” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"b) As part of our audit of the accounting treatment of the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U., we examined, 
obtained an understanding of, and assessed the underlying contractual agreements."
"We also matched the 
purchase price paid by Rheinmetall Aktiengesellschaft to date with corresponding evidence of the payments 
made."
"In connection with the audit of the purchase price allocation, we satisfied ourselves of the qualifications and 
objectivity of the external expert commissioned by Rheinmetall."
"One focus of our audit was on identifying and 
assessing the intangible assets recognized as a result of the purchase price allocation and their value-driving 
factors."
"With the support of our internal valuation specialists, we assessed the appropriateness of the 
valuation models and methods applied."
"We evaluated the plausibility of the assumptions made in the 
executive board’s planning based on independently determined market expectations and discussions with the 
executive board, the division management, and the external expert."
"In this context, we also assessed to what 
extent the revenue purchase price allocation was influenced by subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk 
factors."
"In the case of estimates made by the executive board, we assessed the reasonableness of the methods 
applied, the assumptions made, and the data used."
"We also assessed whether the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are 
complete and correct."
"Other Information 
The executive board and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information."
The supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board.
"The executive board and the 
supervisory board are responsible for the statement according to Section 161 AktG on the German Corporate 
Governance Code, which is part of the combined corporate governance statement included in the section 
“Corporate governance” of the combined management report."
"Otherwise, the executive board is responsible for 
the other information."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not 
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance 
conclusion thereon."
"In addition, the executive board is responsible for such internal control as it has determined necessary to 
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud (i.e."
fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive board is responsible for assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern."
"It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern."
"In addition, it is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of 
accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic 
alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of 
the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report."
"The executive board and the supervisory board are further responsible for the preparation of the remuneration 
report, including the related disclosures, which is included in a separate section of the combined management 
report and which complies with the requirements of Section 162 AktG."
"In addition, they are responsible for such 
internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including 
the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e."
"fraudulent financial 
reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report."
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
" 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive board and the reasonableness of 
estimates made by the executive board and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to 
cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
" 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
combined management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.
" 
evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its 
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
" 
perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive board in the combined 
management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the 
significant assumptions used by the executive board as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate 
the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate 
audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial 
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter."
"There it is stated that some of the wording and 
terminology contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon are still subject to 
considerable interpretation uncertainty and have not yet been officially clarified."
"The executive board sets out how 
it has made the necessary interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon."
"As there is the inherent risk that indefinite legal concepts may allow for various interpretations, the legal 
conformity of the interpretation is prone to uncertainty."
"Our audit opinion on the combined management report 
was not modified in this respect."
"Our responsibilities in this context are further described in the “Group Auditor’s Responsibilities for 
the Audit of the ESEF Documents” section."
"Our audit firm has applied the requirements of the IDW Standards on 
Quality Management."
"1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to Sec-
tion 328 (1) sentence 4 no."

financial reporting process."
"
identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements
of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion."
"
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls."
"
evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e."
"whether the file containing the ESEF documents
meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance
sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file."
