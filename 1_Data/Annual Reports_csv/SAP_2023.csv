on our current expectations, assumptions, and projections about future conditions and events."
"As a 
result, our forward-looking statements and information are subject to uncertainties and risks."
"A broad 
range of uncertainties and risks, many of which are beyond our control, could cause our actual results 
and performance to differ materially from any projections expressed in or implied by our forward-
looking statements."
"– Technology and Products: Our technology and products may experience undetected defects, 
coding, or configuration errors, may not integrate as expected, or may not meet customer 
expectations."
"– Ethical Behavior: Our global business exposes us to risks related to unethical behavior and non-
compliance with policies by employees, other individuals, partners, third parties or entities 
associated with SAP."
"– International Laws and Regulations: Laws, regulatory requirements and standards in Germany, the 
United States, and elsewhere continue to be very stringent."
"Our international business activities and 
processes expose us to numerous and often conflicting laws and regulations, policies, standards, or 
other requirements and sometimes even conflicting regulatory requirements."
"– Market Share and Profit: Our market share and profit could decline due to increased competition, 
market consolidation, technological innovation, and new business models in the software industry."
"– Global Economic and Political Environment: Uncertainty in the global economy and/or, financial 
markets, and social and political instability caused by state-based conflicts, terrorist attacks, civil 
unrest, war, or international hostilities could lead to disruptions in our business."
"– Sales and Services: Sales and implementation of SAP software and services, including cloud, are 
subject to several significant risks sometimes beyond our direct control."
"– Mergers and Acquisitions: We might not acquire, integrate and divest companies effectively or 
successfully."
"– Legal and IP: Claims and lawsuits against us, such as for IP infringements, or our inability to obtain or 
maintain adequate licenses for third-party technology, or if we are unable to adequately protect or 
enforce our own intellectual property, may result in adverse outcomes."
"– Partner Ecosystem: If we are unable to scale, maintain, and enhance an effective partner ecosystem, 
revenue might not increase as expected."
We describe these and other risks and uncertainties in the Risk Factors section.
"If one or more of these uncertainties or risks materializes, or if management’s underlying assumptions 
prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially from those described in or inferred from our 
forward-looking statements and information."
"To fully consider the factors that could affect our future financial results, both this report and our 
Integrated Report should be considered, as well as all of our other filings with the U.S."
"Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC)."
"Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-
looking statements, which speak only as of the date specified or the date of this report."
"We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new 
information that we receive about conditions that existed upon issuance of this report, future events, or 
otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law."
"This report includes statistical data about the IT industry and global economic trends that comes from 
information published by sources including International Data Corporation (IDC), Gartner, the 
European Central Bank (ECB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"This type of data represents 
only the estimates of IDC, Gartner, the ECB, the IMF, and other sources of industry data."
"SAP does not 
adopt or endorse any of the statistical information provided by sources such as IDC, Gartner, the ECB, 
the IMF, or other similar sources that is contained in this report."
"The data from these sources is subject 
to risks and uncertainties, and subject to change based on various factors, including those described 
above, in the Risk Factors section, and elsewhere in this report."
"These and other factors could cause 
our results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by third parties and SAP."
We caution readers not to place undue reliance on this data.
"We view growth 
and profitability as indicators of our current performance, while we see customer loyalty, employee 
engagement, and carbon impact as indicators of our future performance."
"In addition to these, we used several supporting measures to provide 
further insight into our financial performance: 
Cloud revenue: This revenue driver comprises the main revenues of our cloud business."
"Revenue 
from cloud is derived from fees earned from providing customers with software as a service (SaaS), 
platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS)."
"We measure cloud revenue at actual 
and constant currencies."
"For more information about the composition of cloud revenue, and for a description of these services, 
see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (A.1)."
"Cloud and software revenue: We use cloud and software revenue expressed in both actual 
currencies and constant currencies to measure our product growth."
"Our cloud and software revenue 
includes cloud revenue plus software license revenue and software support revenue."
"Cloud revenue 
and software support revenue are our two largest revenue streams."
"Customers that purchase software 
licenses also enter into related support contracts that generate recurring support revenue after the 
software sale."
"SAP S/4HANA Cloud revenue: We used SAP S/4HANA Cloud revenue expressed in both actual 
currencies and constant currencies as an additional metric to measure our cloud core ERP growth."
"SAP 
offers a choice of SAP S/4HANA Cloud deployments – as a public cloud or private cloud SaaS offering."
"Starting in 2024, SAP S/4HANA Cloud revenue will be replaced by the Cloud ERP Suite revenue 
metric."
"Cloud ERP Suite revenue: We use Cloud ERP Suite revenue expressed in both actual currencies and 
constant currencies as a metric to measure the growth of our portfolio of strategic cloud solutions."
"Cloud ERP Suite references those offerings that are tightly integrated with our core ERP solutions and 
are included in key commercial packages, such as RISE with SAP."
"The following offerings currently 
contribute to Cloud ERP Suite revenue: SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Business Technology Platform, and 
core solutions for HR and payroll, spend management, commerce, customer data solutions, business 
process transformation, and working capital management."
"Total revenue: We use total revenue to measure our growth at both actual currencies and constant 
currencies."
"Share of more predictable revenue: We use share of more predictable revenue as a measure to 
provide additional insight into our sustained business success."
"The total of cloud revenue and support 
revenue divided by total revenue is the share of more predictable revenue."
"1 Unless otherwise stated, all performance measures are based on our continuing operations."
"Thus, they are subcomponents of our overall remaining performance obligations 
following IFRS 15.120."
"For our committed cloud business, we believe the TCB and the CCB are 
valuable indicators of our go-to-market success, as they reflect both new contracts won and existing 
contracts renewed."
"For more information on how we calculate these numbers, see the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (A.1)."
"As an additional metric, we used SAP S/4HANA CCB to measure the contractually committed cloud 
core ERP revenue we expect to recognize over the upcoming 12 months as of a specific key date."
"Starting in 2024, we will no longer disclose SAP S/4HANA CCB."
"Cloud gross profit (non-IFRS): We use cloud gross profit (non-IFRS) expressed in both actual 
currencies and constant currencies to measure the process efficiency and performance of our cloud 
business."
"Operating profit (non-IFRS): We use operating profit (non-IFRS) expressed in both actual currencies 
and constant currencies to measure our overall operational process efficiency and overall business 
performance."
"Cloud gross margin (non-IFRS): We use our cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) to measure our process 
efficiency in our cloud business."
"Cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) is the ratio of our cloud gross profit 
(non-IFRS) to cloud revenue, expressed as a percentage."
"Operating margin (non-IFRS): We use operating margin (non-IFRS) to measure our overall 
operational process efficiency."
"Operating margin (non-IFRS) is the ratio of our operating profit (non-
IFRS) to total revenue, expressed as a percentage."
"To manage our financial income, net, 
we focus on cash flow, the composition of our liquid assets and capital investment portfolio, and the 
average rate of interest at which liquid assets and capital investments are invested."
"We also monitor 
average outstanding borrowings and associated finance costs."
"Measures to Manage Overall Financial Performance 
We used free cash flow as the key measure to manage our overall financial performance."
"It represents the portion of profit after tax attributable to equity holders of SAP SE 
allocable to each SAP share outstanding."
"EPS is influenced not only by our operating and non-
operating business and income taxes but also by the number of shares outstanding."
"2 We report earnings per share for our continuing operations, and total earnings per share for our continuing and discontinued operations."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
13 
 
Effective tax rate (IFRS and non-IFRS): We define our effective tax rate as the ratio of income tax 
expense to profit before tax, expressed as a percentage."
"Operating, investing, and financing cash flows and free cash flow: Our consolidated statements of 
cash flows provide insight into how we generated and used cash and cash equivalents."
"We use our free cash flow measure to determine the cash flow remaining after all 
expenditures required to maintain or expand our organic business have been paid off."
"This measure 
provides management with supplemental information to assess our liquidity needs."
"We calculate free 
cash flow as net cash from operating activities minus purchases (other than purchases made in 
connection with business combinations) of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, as 
well as payments of lease liabilities."
"Measures to Manage Our Non-Financial Performance 
In the reporting year, we used the Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS), Employee Engagement Index, 
and net carbon emissions as our key measures to manage our non-financial performance."
"In addition 
to these, we used the Leadership Trust NPS as a supporting measure to provide further insight into our 
non-financial performance: 
Customer NPS: The annual assessment of customer loyalty is based on a survey that includes the 
Customer NPS metric."
"The Customer NPS score is calculated based on the “Likelihood to 
Recommend” question with its proprietary scoring, identified on a scale of 0–10."
"We use this measure 
because we believe that we can only achieve our financial goals when our customers are loyal to, and 
satisfied with, SAP and our solutions."
"To derive the Customer NPS, we start with the percentage of 
“promoters” of SAP, that is, those giving us a score of 9 or 10 on a scale of 0–10."
"We then subtract the 
percentage of “detractors,” that is, those giving us a score of 0–6."
"The method ignores “passives,” that is, 
those giving us a score of 7 or 8."
"Consequently, the range of achievable scores is –100 to +100, with the 
latter being the best achievable score for customer loyalty as measured by the Customer NPS 
methodology."
"Starting in 2023, we made adjustments to the survey to further improve data quality and 
to align the sample more closely with SAP’s business priorities."
"We have excluded incomplete 
responses and responses from respondents who report that they have no influence over purchasing 
decisions, and we have restricted the number of eligible responses from Concur."
"We determine the Employee Engagement Index and the Leadership Trust NPS as the average of the 
scores retrieved in each of the surveys we run within a fiscal year."
"Our engagement survey program 
“#Unfiltered” runs according to a “continuously listening” approach that includes multiple data 
collections throughout the year."
"The average scores provide an assessment, for the full year, of our 
employees’ engagement and trust level."
"We measure both the Employee Engagement Index and the Leadership Trust NPS to get insights on 
the following:  
– Employee Engagement Index: We use this index to measure the satisfaction and commitment of 
our employees, how proud they are of our company, and how strongly they identify with SAP."
Applying this measure is recognition that our growth strategy depends on engaged employees.
"The 
index is measured as a percentage of favorable responses using five questions from our #Unfiltered 
engagement survey program."
"– Leadership Trust NPS: We use this score to further enhance accountability and to measure our 
collective effort to foster a work environment based on trust."
"It is derived from a question in our 
surveys that gauges employees’ trust in our leaders."
"Based on the Customer NPS methodology, the 
Leadership Trust NPS is calculated as a percentage of “promoters” (a score of 9 or 10 on a 10-point 
scale) minus the percentage of “detractors” (a score of 1 through 6)."
"The method ignores “passives” 
(a score of 7 or 8)."
"Consequently, the value range of the NPS is –100 to +100, with the latter being 
the best achievable score."
"SAP is dedicated to promoting gender equality in the workplace and is working toward achieving 
gender balance at all levels of the organization."
"Our priority, with the help of this KPI, is to monitor how the Company is progressing on this 
commitment, especially at the most senior levels of the organization."
"Greenhouse gas emissions: We use the following metrics to measure our progress toward our 
ambitious short-term and long-term climate targets (in kilotons of CO2 equivalents, rounded to the 
nearest kiloton)."
"We define, measure, and report our greenhouse gas emissions according to the 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol."
"– Net carbon emissions: We used this metric to measure our progress toward our ambition to 
become carbon neutral in our own operations by 2023."
"The net carbon emissions (scope 1, 
scope 2, and selected scope 3 emissions) are calculated by deducting self-produced renewable 
energy, renewable energy certificates, and carbon offsets from our gross carbon emissions."
"The net 
carbon emissions metric will be discontinued from 2024 and replaced by the Gross greenhouse gas 
emissions metric."
"– Gross greenhouse gas emissions: Starting in 2024, we will use this metric to measure greenhouse 
gas emissions along the value chain (scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions relevant for SAP’s 
business model) as part of our Net Zero by 2030 commitment."
We apply a market-based approach.
"Value-Based Management 
Our holistic view of the performance measures described above, and the associated analyses, are 
together the foundation of our value-based management."
"We use planning and control processes to 
manage the compilation of these key measures and their availability to our decision-makers across 
various management levels."
"SAP’s long-term strategic plans are the point of reference for our short- and medium-term planning and 
controlling processes."
"We initially identify future growth and profitability drivers at a highly aggregated 
level for the entire SAP Group."
"In a first step, the financial plan’s growth ambition is determined by its 
comprehensive product portfolio which is grouped into solution areas, with profitability drivers 
allocated to functions such as development, marketing, sales, delivery, and administration."
"In a second 
step, the planned total revenues and total expenses are generally allocated to the operating segments 
and the areas of functional responsibility of the individual members of the Executive Board (“Board 
area”)."
"If a Board area represents not only a functional department but also has responsibility for 
operating segments within this Board area, the allocation is done at the lower segment level."
"Budget 
adjustments may be applied during the year to reflect changes in priorities, to achieve efficiency 
targets, and to reflect endogenous and exogenous factors."
"Such budget adjustments, and the 
assessment of performance, are handled at Board area level if the Board area is part of a segment, or 
at segment level if the Board area comprises several segments."
"It is then the individual Executive 
Board member’s responsibility to break down the allocated budget adjustments within the segment 
budget boundary."
"Based on an integrated portfolio process running in parallel to the budgeting 
process, we ensure aligned investment behavior across Board areas with regard to specific solution 
and/or subsolution areas."
"In a final step, customer-facing revenue targets and cost-of-sales and 
marketing targets are broken down into sales regions and market units."
"Based on our detailed annual plans, we determine the budget for the respective fiscal year."
"We also 
have processes in place to forecast revenue and profit on a quarterly basis, to quantify whether we 
expect to realize our financial targets, and to identify any deviations from plan."
"We continuously 
monitor the affected operating segments and Board areas in the SAP Group to analyze their 
developments and define any appropriate actions."
"Non-IFRS Financial Measures Cited in This Report 
Explanation of Non-IFRS Measures 
We disclose certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS and are 
therefore considered non-IFRS financial measures."
"Our non-IFRS financial measures may not 
correspond to non-IFRS financial measures that other companies report."
"The non-IFRS financial 
measures that we report should only be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, nor as 
superior to, our IFRS financial measures."
"– The variable components of our Executive Board members’ and employees’ remuneration are 
based on non-IFRS numbers such as operating profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS) 
rather than the respective IFRS measures."
An additional variable component used is CCB.
"In 
September 2023, the SAP Supervisory Board decided that although expenses and corresponding 
releases for provisions for regulatory compliance matters are eliminated from operating profit (non-
IFRS), they will affect the compensation paid to Executive Board members from fiscal year 2025 
onward."
"This amendment does not apply to 2023 or 2024, to ensure that the Executive Board 
members’ current compensation is not affected by conduct that took place in performance periods 
prior to their appointment to the Executive Board."
"– The annual budgeting process for all management units is based on operating profit (non-IFRS) 
numbers rather than the respective IFRS financial measure."
"– All forecast and performance reviews with all senior managers globally are based on these non-
IFRS measures, rather than the respective IFRS financial measures."
"– Both our internal performance targets and the guidance we provide to the capital markets are 
based on profit (non-IFRS) measures rather than the respective IFRS financial measures."
"Our non-IFRS financial measures reflect adjustments based on the items below, as well as adjustments 
for the related income tax effects."
"Since management at levels below 
the Executive Board does not influence these expenses, we generally do not consider these expenses 
for the purpose of evaluating the performance of management units."
"For similar reasons, until 2023 we 
excluded share-based payment expenses, as these costs are impacted by share price developments 
and other factors beyond our control."
"We also exclude restructuring expenses because they are 
volatile and generally cannot be influenced by management at levels below the Executive Board."
"In recent years, SAP has replaced many of its cash-settled share-based compensation plans with 
equity-settled plans."
"Having most of these plans as equity-settled reduces the impact of share price 
fluctuations and of other factors outside of our control."
"For these reasons, SAP has decided that, from 
2024, it will no longer exclude share-based payment expenses from its operating profit (non-IFRS)."
"We will exclude gains and losses from equity securities, net, for the purpose of increasing 
comparability period over period, by reducing volatility caused by share price fluctuation, market 
developments, and other factors beyond our control."
"Constant Currencies Information 
We believe it is important for investors to have information that provides insight into the development 
of our sales."
"Revenue measures determined under IFRS provide information that is useful in this 
regard."
"However, both sales volume and currency effects impact period-over-period changes in sales 
revenue."
"We do not sell standardized units of products and services so we cannot provide relevant 
information on sales volume by providing data on the changes in product and service units sold."
"To 
provide additional information that may be useful to investors in breaking down and evaluating 
changes in sales volume, we present information about our revenue and various values and 
components relating to operating profit that are adjusted for foreign currency effects."
"We calculate 
constant currency measures by translating foreign currencies using the average exchange rates from 
the comparative period instead of the current period."
"Constant currency measures on CCB use the 
closing exchange rate from the previous year’s corresponding key date instead of the average 
exchange rate."
"Free Cash Flow 
Among other measures, we use free cash flow to manage our overall financial performance."
"We define 
free cash flow as net cash from operating activities minus purchases of intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment, and payments of lease liabilities."
"We exclude 
the expense adjustments outlined above when making decisions to allocate resources."
"In addition, 
we use these non-IFRS measures to facilitate comparisons of SAP’s operating performance from 
period to period."
"– The non-IFRS measures provide investors with additional information that enables a comparison of 
year-over-year operating performance by eliminating certain direct effects of acquisitions, share-
based compensation plans, restructuring plans, and regulatory compliance matters."
"– Non-IFRS and non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures are widely used in 
the software industry."
"In many cases, inclusion of our non-IFRS measures may facilitate comparison 
with our competitors’ corresponding non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures."
"– The acquisition-related amortization expense that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) 
numbers is a recurring expense that will impact our financial performance in future years."
"– The remaining acquisition-related charges that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) 
numbers are likely to recur should SAP enter into business combinations in the future."
"Similarly, the 
restructuring expenses that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers are likely to recur 
should SAP perform restructurings in the future."
"– The expense adjustment for acquisition-related charges does not arise from a common conceptual 
basis."
"This is because the expense adjustment aims to improve the comparability between post-
acquisition periods and pre-acquisition periods."
"This should particularly be considered when 
evaluating our operating profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS) numbers, as these 
combine our revenue and expenses (non-IFRS) despite the absence of a common conceptual 
basis."
"– Our restructuring charges resulted in significant cash outflows in the past and could do so in the 
future."
"– In the past, we have issued share-based payment awards to our employees every year and we 
intend to continue doing so in the future."
"Thus, our share-based payment expenses are recurring, 
although the amounts usually change from period to period."
"– Expenses ascribed to the regulatory compliance matters may include penalties and legal costs, all 
of which would impact the operating cash flows of the business."
"We believe that constant currency measures have limitations, particularly as the currency effects that 
are eliminated constitute a significant element of our revenue and expenses and could materially

18 
 
impact our performance."
"Therefore, we limit our use of constant currency measures to the analysis of 
changes in volume as one element of the full change in a financial measure."
"We do not evaluate our 
results and performance without considering operating profit (non-IFRS) at both nominal and constant 
currencies on the one hand, and changes in operating expenses, operating profit, or other measures of 
financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS on the other."

"As a global company, we are influenced by multiple external factors that are difficult to predict, may 
develop quickly, and are beyond our influence and control."
"Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial 
position, profit, and cash flows."
"International Laws and Regulations: Laws, regulatory requirements and standards in Germany, 
the United States, and elsewhere continue to be very stringent."
"Our international business 
activities and processes expose us to numerous and often conflicting laws and regulations, 
policies, standards, or other requirements, and sometimes even conflicting regulatory 
requirements."
The SAP Group has a global presence and operates in most countries of the world.
"As a European 
company domiciled in Germany with securities listed in Germany and the United States, we are 
subject to European, German, U.S., and other governance-related regulatory requirements of the 
countries we operate in."
"As we expand into new countries and markets or extend our business activities in these markets, 
including emerging and high-risk markets, these risks could intensify."
"The application of the respective 
local laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear, subject to change over time, and 
often conflicting among jurisdictions."
"Additionally, these laws and government approaches to 
enforcement continue to change and evolve, just as our products and services continually evolve."
"Compliance with these varying laws and regulations, including antitrust regulations, could involve 
significant costs or require changes in our products or business practices."
"Non-compliance could 
result in the imposition of penalties or cessation of orders due to alleged non-compliant activity."
"Governmental authorities could use considerable discretion in applying these statutes and any 
imposition of sanctions against us could be material."
"Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations globally or in one or more 
countries or regions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, 
profit, and cash flows."
"Moreover, protecting and defending our intellectual property is crucial to our success."
"The outcome of 
litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain."
"Moreover, the 
laws and courts of certain countries might not offer effective means to enforce our legal or intellectual 
property rights."
"Finally, SAP may not be able to collect or otherwise enforce all judgments awarded to 
it in legal proceedings."
The outcome of litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.
Management’s view of the litigation might also change in the future.
"Actual outcomes of litigation and 
other claims or lawsuits could differ from the assessments made by management in prior periods, 
which are the basis for our accounting for these litigations and claims under IFRS."
"As a global software and service provider, SAP is required to comply with local laws wherever it does 
business."
"One of the relevant European data protection laws is the General Data Protection 
Regulation."
"International data transfers to third countries that do not provide for an adequate level of 
data protection require additional safeguards, including transfer risk assessments, to justify a transfer 
from the EU to a third country under the new EU standard contractual clauses."
"This may impose additional burdens for SAP due to 
increasing compliance standards that could restrict the use and adoption of SAP’s products and 
services (in particular cloud services) and make it more challenging and complex to meet customer 
expectations."
"These changing criteria also impact the compliant use of new technology, such as 
machine learning and Artificial Intelligence for product development and deployment of intelligent 
applications."
"Non-compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws by SAP or any of the subprocessors 
engaged by SAP within the processing of personal data could lead to risks."
"In addition, the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and security industry 
experts continue to warn of risks related to a globally growing number of cybersecurity attacks aimed 
at obtaining or violating company data including personal data."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F

Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial 
performance, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows."
"Corporate Governance and Compliance Risks  
Ethical Behavior: Our global business exposes us to risks related to unethical behavior and non-
compliance with policies by employees, other individuals, partners, third parties, or entities 
associated with SAP."
"SAP’s leadership position in the global market is founded on the long-term and sustainable trust of our 
stakeholders worldwide."
"Our overarching approach is one of corporate transparency, open 
communication with financial markets, regulators, and authorities, and adherence to recognized 
standards of business integrity."
"This commitment to recognized standards of business integrity is 
formalized in SAP’s CoEBC and supporting guidelines."
"Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or 
financial position, profit, and cash flows."
These investigations culminated in January 2024 in a settlement agreement with the U.S.
"Securities 
and Exchange Commission (U.S."
Department of Justice (U.S.
"DOJ), as well as with 
local authorities in South Africa."
"SAP fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities, and took 
immediate steps to discipline the employees involved, including terminating all those implicated in 
potential law violations."
"Since these allegations were made, SAP has also significantly strengthened its 
compliance program and related internal controls in accordance with DOJ and regulatory expectations 
and requirements."
"SAP has encountered situations in the past that required clear messaging and strong action on non-
compliance in the context of corrupt behavior that has the potential to harm our business and 
reputation."
SAP is continuing to investigate its dealings with the public sector.
"Operational Business Risks 
Sales and Services: Sales and implementation of SAP software and services, including cloud, are 
subject to several significant risks sometimes beyond our direct control."
A core element of our business is the successful implementation of software and service solutions.
"The implementation of SAP software and cloud-based service deliveries is led by SAP, by partners, by 
customers, or by a combination thereof."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
27 
 
Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial 
position, profit, and cash flows."
"Partner Ecosystem: If we are unable to scale, maintain, and enhance an effective partner 
ecosystem, revenue might not increase as expected."
An open and vibrant partner ecosystem is a fundamental pillar of our success and growth strategy.
"We 
have entered into partnership agreements that drive co-innovation on our platforms, profitably expand 
our routes to market to optimize market coverage, optimize cloud delivery, and provide high-quality 
services capacity in all market segments."
"Partners play a key role in driving market adoption of our 
entire solutions portfolio, by co-innovating on our platforms, embedding our technology, and reselling 
or implementing our software."
"If any of these risks materialize, this might have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and 
services as well as the partner’s loyalty and ability to deliver."
"As a result, we might not be able to scale 
our business to compete successfully with other vendors, which could have an adverse effect on our 
reputation, business, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows."
"Cloud Operations: We may not be able to properly protect and safeguard our critical 
information and assets, business operations, cloud offerings and portfolio presentation, and 
related infrastructure against cyberattacks, insufficient infrastructure, disruption, or deficient 
performance."
"SAP is highly dependent on the availability, integrity, and reliability of our infrastructure, including 
infrastructure provided by third-party business partners, and the software used in our cloud portfolio is 
inherently complex."
"Customers using our cloud services rely on the security of our infrastructure to 
protect the availability of our services and the data that they store on our infrastructure."
"Threat actors 
are focused on attacking third-party product and service providers, such as SAP, as a means of 
compromising our and our downstream customers’ systems and data."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
28 
 
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or 
financial position, profit, and cash flows."
"Cybersecurity and Security: Cybersecurity attacks or breaches, and security vulnerabilities in 
our infrastructure or services or those of our third-party partners could materially impact our 
business operations, products, and service delivery."
"SAP delivers a full portfolio of solutions, hosts or manages elements of our customers’ businesses in 
the cloud, processes large amounts of data, and provides mobile solutions to users."
"While SAP 
executes each of these areas either directly or through partners and other third parties, our industry 
continues to experience a complex and threatening cybersecurity landscape."
"The severity of these 
cybersecurity threats is amplified due to the increasingly sophisticated and malicious global 
landscape in which we operate."
"When we become aware of 
unauthorized access to our systems or those of our third-party partners, we have action plans in place 
intended to identify and remediate the source and impact of such events."
"Like many companies, we 
and certain of our third-party partners have experienced and expect to continue to experience 
cyberattacks and other security incidents that affect our business."
"While we experience cybersecurity 
incidents of various kinds in the ordinary course of our business, we are not aware of any such 
incidents that have had a material impact on our business."
"Given the nature of complex systems, 
software and services like ours, and the scanning tools that we deploy across our networks and 
products, we regularly identify and track security vulnerabilities."
"Security vulnerabilities are prioritized 
based on known and anticipated risks, and remediation activities aim to patch within the designated 
timeframes."
"Although we have standard routine patch management processes, we are unable to 
comprehensively apply patches or to confirm that mitigating measures are in place to mitigate all such 
vulnerabilities, or that any patches will be applied before exploitation by a threat actor."
"In other 
situations, vulnerabilities persist even after we have issued security patches, because our customers 
may fail to either apply the patches, update their systems, or authorize service downtime sufficient to 
allow for patching by SAP."
"If attackers are able to exploit vulnerabilities before patches are installed or 
mitigating measures are implemented, significant compromises could impact our and our customers’ 
systems and data."
"Security threats may also exist due to delayed or insufficient responses to identified issues or 
other interdependencies such as cloud service providers and those beyond SAP’s cybersecurity 
infrastructure and protocols."
"SAP’s and/or its partners’ lack of sufficient security controls or compliance 
with existing controls could impact SAP’s and/or its partners’ ability to comply with applicable 
regulations and customer requirements."
"SAP and/or its partners could unknowingly introduce security 
threats and vulnerabilities without established security evaluation processes."
"Additionally, failure to 
integrate or maintain SAP’s cybersecurity infrastructure and protocols with network systems obtained 
through acquisitions could result in cyberbreaches, a loss of data confidentiality and integrity, and/or a 
loss of system availability."
"Technology and Products: Our technology and products may experience undetected defects, 
coding or configuration errors, may not integrate as expected, or may not meet customer 
expectations."
"Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or 
financial position, profit, and cash flows."
"Strategic Risks 
Market Share and Profit: Our market share and profit could decline due to increased 
competition, market consolidation, technological innovation, and new business models in the 
software industry."
"The market for cloud computing is increasingly competitive and is exhibiting strong growth relative to 
the market for on-premise solutions."
"To maintain or improve our operating results in the cloud 
business, it is important that we not only attract new customers but also that our existing customers 
renew their agreements with us when the initial contract term expires and purchase additional 
modules or additional capacity."
"Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or 
financial position, profit, and cash flows."
"Mergers and Acquisitions: We might not acquire, integrate, or divest companies or their 
components effectively or successfully."
"To expand and consolidate our business, we acquire and divest businesses, products, and 
technologies, and we expect to continue doing so in the future."
"Over time, some of these acquisitions 
have increased in size and in strategic importance for SAP."
"Management negotiation of potential 
acquisitions and divestures and the integration and carve-out of acquired businesses, products, or 
technologies demands time, focus, and resources of both management and the workforce, and 
exposes us to unpredictable operational difficulties."
"We have in the past, and may in the future, choose to divest certain entities, businesses, or product 
lines."
We may have difficulty obtaining terms acceptable to us.
"Additionally, we may experience 
difficulty carving out portions of or entire businesses, we may incur a loss of revenue or experience a 
negative impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits."
"If a divestiture is not completed for any reason, we may not be able to 
find another buyer on the same terms, and we may have incurred significant costs without the 
corresponding benefit."
"Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or 
financial position, profit, and cash flows."
"Innovation: We might not be able to compete effectively if we strategize our solution portfolio 
ineffectively or if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological and product innovations, 
enhancements, new business models, and changing market expectations."
"To be successful, we are required to adapt our products and our go-to-
market approach to a cloud-based delivery and consumption model so as to satisfy increasing 
customer demand and to ensure an appropriate level of adoption, customer satisfaction, and 
retention."
"We are integrating AI into a number of our products, including our suite of enterprise applications and 
SAP BTP, and we expect our use of AI across our portfolio to continue to grow."
"As with many 
innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business."
AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed.
"Data sets may be overbroad, insufficient, or 
contain biased information."
"Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise 
harmful."
"Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by SAP or our partners 
could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, 
customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended."
"Human review of 
certain outputs may be required, which could introduce error or inefficiencies to the intended use of 
our AI-enabled offerings."
"As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative 
technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory 
action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm."
"In particular, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the applications of intellectual property and 
privacy laws to AI technology."
"In addition, our AI 
technology may involve the processing of personal and other sensitive data and may be subject to 
laws, policies, legal obligations, and contractual requirements related to privacy, data protection, and 
information security."
"Various privacy laws extend rights to consumers (such as the right to obtain 
consent or delete certain personal data) and regulate automated decision making."
"An alleged or actual 
failure to meet these obligations may lead to regulatory investigations and fines or penalties; may 
require us to change our business practices or retrain our algorithms; or may prevent or limit our use of 
AI technology."
"In addition, some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society, and there 
can be no assurance that our Global AI Ethics Policy or similar policies and procedures will be 
sufficient to address such issues."
"Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or 
financial position, profit, and cash flows."

business requirements."
"RISE with SAP aims to provide enhanced productivity by means of automated 
processes, with the option of running technology operations as a service with SAP or in the customer’s 
own data center."
"GROW with SAP is a commercial offering designed specifically to help grow midmarket companies 
that do not yet use an ERP system from SAP and aspire to go live within a short period of time without 
extensive customization."
"With GROW with SAP, customers can use predefined best-practice 
processes that are available for different industries, and can benefit from predictable costs, the 
continuous provision of technical innovations, and scalability."
"It is designed so that companies can 
grow according to their needs, without significantly increasing the complexity for business processes 
and management."
"As the IT landscape continues to rapidly evolve, SAP is seeing a clear shift in customer preferences 
together with a growing demand for flexibility, agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness."

Our Customers 
Vision and Strategy 
Focusing on Customer Success 
We aim to maximize the value our customers derive from their investment in, and relationship with, SAP 
at every touchpoint in their experience with us over the engagement lifecycle."
"Our customer-facing 
teams – across solutions, sales, services, customer engagement, ecosystem, and others – work 
together along an operating model that aims to harmonize internal processes with the goal of 
delivering improved outcomes for our customers."
"Company-Wide Global Experience Program  
To further address and improve customer feedback, we have a Company-Wide Global Experience 
(XM) Program in place."
"This program aims to achieve a consistent end-to-end experience for our 
customers by standardizing experience initiatives and methodologies to help identify and close 
experience gaps across SAP."
"Due Diligence 
Governance 
The head of Customer Success leads all customer-facing functions across sales, services, partner, and 
cloud engagements for SAP’s businesses globally."
"The Chief Marketing and Solutions Officer leads the 
development of our solution value propositions to provide clarity on SAP’s core differentiators."
"The 
People & Operations Board area is responsible for the Company-Wide XM Program, including 
conducting the Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey."
Customer NPS is a KPI in the short-term incentive component of Executive Board remuneration.
"For 
more information about the Customer NPS, see the Performance Management System section."
"Guidelines and Policies 
Policies such as the Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct for Employees and applicable 
General Terms and Conditions for our product govern our relationships with our customers."
"How We Measure and Manage Our Performance 
We use the Customer NPS as a feedback mechanism to measure customer loyalty."
"This and other 
results from the customer survey allow us to directly understand the customer experience and identify 
key pain points for action."
"Because of the importance of our customers to SAP, Customer NPS is one of 
our main non-financial KPIs."
"In 2023, our Customer NPS increased 2 points year over year to 9 (2022: 714), which is within our target 
range of 8 to 12."
"The increase was driven by feedback regarding our comprehensive and robust SAP 
solutions, established value to customers’ business, and relationships with account teams."
"The 
Company-Wide XM Program ensures that the feedback received is heard by the responsible 
organizations within SAP so they can act to continually improve the customer experience."
"For 2024, we expect a Customer NPS of 9 to 13."
"Further, we aim to see continuous improvements and 
to increase the score steadily in the medium term."

Our Investments in Innovation 
SAP’s strong commitment to research and development (R&D) is reflected in our expenditures:  
  
1 The numbers for 2023, 2022, and 2021 reflect continuing operations as a result of the divestiture of Qualtrics."
"2 In 2023, SAP updated its cost allocation policy."
R&D numbers for 2020 and 2019 have not been retrospectively adjusted.
"For more 
information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (IN.1)."
"In 2023, our IFRS R&D ratio, reflecting R&D expenses as a portion of total revenue, decreased 
0.3 percentage points (pp) to 20.3% (2022: 20.6%)."
"Our non-IFRS R&D ratio decreased 1.1 pp to 18.0% 
year over year (2022: 19.1%)."
"At the end of 2023, our total full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount in 
development was 36,444 (2022: 35,280)."
"Measured in FTEs, our R&D headcount increased 1 pp to 34% 
of total headcount (2022: 33%)."
"Total R&D expense not only includes our own personnel costs but also the external costs of work and 
services from the providers and cooperation partners we work with to deliver and enhance our 
products."
"As at December 31, 2023, SAP held a total of 
close to 13,000 (2022: close to 13,000) validated patents worldwide."
"Of these, more than 650 
(2022: more than 800) were granted and validated in 2023."
"While our intellectual property is important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not 
dependent on any particular patent or a combination of patents."
"Competitive Intangibles 
The majority of (intangible) resources that are the basis for our current as well as future success does 
not appear in the book value of equity in our Consolidated Financial Statements."
"This is apparent from 
a comparison of the market capitalization of SAP SE (based on all issued shares), which was 
€171.4 billion at the end of 2023 (2022: €118.4 billion), with the book value of our equity in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, which was €43.4 billion (2022: €42.8 billion)."
"This means that the 
market capitalization of our equity is more than three times higher than the book value."

"Seasonality 
Our business has historically experienced the highest revenue in the fourth quarter of each year, 
primarily due to year-end capital purchases by customers."
"Such factors have resulted in 2023, 2022, 
and 2021 first quarter revenue being lower than revenue in the prior year’s fourth quarter."
"We believe 
that this trend will continue in the near future but to a smaller extent as predictable revenues will 
further increase their share of total revenues."
"Unlike our on-premise software revenues, our on-premise 
support revenues and cloud revenues are less subject to seasonality and thus help to reduce this 
effect."
"For more information about the development of our share of more predictable revenue in 2023, 
see Item 5."

"Which is why 
security, cloud compliance, and data protection and privacy are of paramount importance to us."
"Therefore, the principles set out in the SAP Global Security Policy govern how we keep our data and 
our customers’ data safe, how we process it in compliance with local legislation, and how we protect it 
from malicious use."
"SAP uses the National Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework 
(NIST CSF) to assess how well we manage cybersecurity risk in the Company."
"The cybersecurity 
governance framework incorporates industry standards and best practices that help guide our 
understanding of cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts, and how to mitigate these risks 
using proactive measures."
"SAP Global Security and Cloud Compliance 
Cloud solutions and services are increasingly important to many companies’ daily operations."
"Organizations today are facing many risk factors and disruptions, such as war, political unrest, severe 
weather, pandemics, cyberattacks, and supply chain disruption, making digital solutions critical to 
organizational resilience."
"As a result, digital transformation is accelerating and cybersecurity is now 
even more crucial to IT security professionals, and to leaders in business and government, particularly 
in those organizations that have moved their core processes to the cloud."
The SAP strategy is focused on helping our customers in their digital transformation.
"Our SAP Global 
Security and Cloud Compliance (SGSC) unit supports this journey with the goals of reducing risk and 
promoting regulatory compliance, and by aligning people, procedures, and technology to protect 
business processes and data."
"The organization embraces a security-minded culture that embeds 
security and compliance in our development and deployment processes and helps secure digital 
transformation."
"SGSC supports key stakeholders across SAP in our lines of business (LoBs), IT, and the presales 
organization in securing solutions, and drives operational excellence for security and cloud 
compliance across the enterprise."
"To protect our organization’s data and assets, and support high-
quality risk management and reporting, SGSC regularly reviews and adapts our security policies, 
standards, and frameworks."
"Data Protection 
With our product and services portfolio, we aim to protect the rights of individuals involved and to 
meet relevant local requirements when processing personal data."
"In addition, we strive to strengthen 
SAP’s reputation in the long term as a sustainable and trustworthy partner in the market."
"We have 
implemented safeguards intended to help protect the fundamental rights of everyone whose data is 
processed by SAP, whether they are customers, suppliers, partners, prospects, employees, or 
applicants."
"We develop and pursue our global data protection and privacy strategy in accordance with our 
business strategy."
"Our global data protection and privacy strategy is to constantly monitor the global 
regulatory data protection compliance landscape, identify relevant stakeholders, and enable them to 
take necessary measures."
It is also designed to safeguard the processing of personal data.
"The 
strategy consists of four pillars to help ensure we comply with applicable data protection laws and 
regulations."
"These pillars are our global data protection and privacy policy, mandatory global data 
protection and privacy trainings for employees, our global data protection and privacy network and  
global data protection management system and its data protection control framework."

Due Diligence for Security and Cloud Compliance Topics 
Governance 
SGSC is led by a chief security compliance and risk officer and a chief security officer who report 
directly to the SAP chief technology officer (CTO)."
"The SAP Security and Cloud Compliance Governance Model is designed to ensure executive 
engagement and facilitates shared responsibility in quarterly SAP Security Advisory Board and 
Security Council meetings and in periodic updates to the Executive Board."
Our commitment to customers is to be open and transparent about security vulnerabilities.
"To ensure 
this, we work with several external stakeholder groups, including the SAP user groups for the Americas 
and for the German-speaking countries."
"Guidelines and Policies 
The purpose of the SAP Global Security Policy is to provide governance and structure for an 
appropriate and effective level of information security at SAP and our affiliated businesses."
"Aligned 
with the overall SAP corporate strategy and vision, it details management expectations and the 
strategic goals and objectives for SAP security."
This policy provides high-level requirements for numerous security domains.
"These include, but are not 
limited to, access control, physical security, network security management, incident response, and 
acceptable use."
"These requirements apply to all SAP employees, contractors, and consultants, and to 
external parties that are granted access to SAP information and information assets."
"SAP reviews the 
policy annually and enacts modifications as deemed appropriate and necessary to protect SAP and 
our own and our customers’ data and assets where new threats or vulnerabilities are identified."
"All SAP 
employees are required to read and adhere to this internal policy."
"The SAP Security Policy 
Framework consists of several levels of security documents that support the requirements described 
in the policy."
"In addition, the various LoBs at SAP may have supporting policies, standards, procedures, 
and practices."
"Due Diligence for Data Protection Topics  
Governance 
Within the scope of their responsibilities, our global data protection officer (DPO) monitors the 
compliance of activities involving the processing of personal data."
The DPO reports to our CFO.
"Within 
the Executive Board, the SAP CFO is responsible for compliance and enforcement of data protection 
and privacy."
"The DPO is responsible for the SAP Global Data Protection and Privacy Policy that 
addresses SAP’s data protection governance, and regularly informs the CFO about the status of data 
protection compliance in the SAP Group."
"To meet and ensure consistent security and data protection compliance, SAP has implemented a 
formal governance model that assigns clear responsibilities across the SAP Group."
"Upon request, the 
DPO attends steering committee meetings and reports on matters relevant to data protection to the 
Audit and Compliance Committee of the SAP Supervisory Board."
"SAP has established a global network of data protection and privacy coordinators (DPPCs) across all 
SAP Group entities that process personal data."
"This DPPC network consists of regional and local 
DPPCs to ensure data protection and privacy compliance on a local level."
"The DPPC network 
sensitizes our employees  by conducting local training and monitoring the legal landscape."
"Where new 
data protection laws evolve, the DPPC network also helps the Data Protection and Privacy (DPP) 
team, which acts on behalf of the DPO, identify and analyze them."
"If this requires compliance activities, 
they align with the affected LoBs and help drive the relevant implementation."
"Supported by the DPPC 
network, the DPP team regularly engages with SAP Government Relations to represent SAP’s interests 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
45 
 
in the legislative process."
"In this regard, SAP participates in external working groups aiming at 
communicating industry-specific interests with respective governments."
SAP has implemented a data protection management system (DPMS) for our organization.
"The DPMS 
adheres to the generally recognized standard for data protection management systems as defined in 
the British Standard BS 10012, which comprises the data protection requirements of the European 
Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since version 10012:2017."
"Our DPMS covers 
almost all LoBs and is planned to be implemented in all acquired companies as well."
"It is designed as 
a framework covering all aspects of data protection compliance of SAP organizations and employees."
"The system is used as SAP’s standard methodology to ensure compliance with data protection 
legislation."
"The maintenance of the framework is subject to certification by the British Standards 
Institution (BSI) that confirms data protection compliance annually."
"Guidelines and Policies 
The SAP Global Data Protection and Privacy Policy sets a Group-wide governance standard and 
structure for the handling of personal data in accordance with data protection and privacy 
requirements."
"It also defines requirements for business processes that involve personal data and 
assigns clear responsibilities."
"The data protection principles set out in this policy are generally 
accepted and enshrined in most data protection laws around the world, including the EU GDPR."
"These 
principles provide the general framework in the SAP Group for the processing of personal data."
"We 
actively monitor changes to applicable laws and regulations so that we can update our standards on 
an ongoing basis as necessary to meet data protection compliance."
"The policy was last updated in 
2023."
"How We Measure and Manage Our Performance 
Security and Cloud Compliance 
Compliance processes at SAP adhere to trust-service criteria established by the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)."
"Our security, privacy, confidentiality, and processing integrity 
controls are designed to achieve the appropriate control objectives."
"In addition, independent, external 
auditing partners regularly conduct security compliance audits."
"SAP discloses vulnerabilities to customers and provides accompanying patches or instructions when 
the customer needs to take action."
"This procedure also applies to the rarer cases where SAP patches 
to cloud services require customer action."
"We disclose these instructions using SAP Security Notes 
published every second Tuesday of the month (Patch Day)."
"By the time any vulnerabilities are 
disclosed to customers, the patches are already applied on cloud landscapes as a rule."
"This process is 
further supported by the publication of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE documents) 
through MITRE that enable integration with the customer’s existing vulnerability and risk management 
tools."
"MITRE is a disclosure mechanism that provides customers with authoritative, public information 
from SAP about SAP software vulnerabilities that can be integrated with their existing risk management 
processes and tools."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
46 
 
We strive to reduce risk by continuously improving our processes for detecting and remediating 
attacks and vulnerabilities."
"The training is conducted every two years, with the latest 
rolled out in 2023."
"This training helps our workforce handle personal data with due care and in 
accordance with the law and to maintain compliance with data protection requirements in their work."
We monitor compliance of data protection-relevant procedures across SAP.
"We maintain a record of 
processing activities (“procedure enrollment tool”), in which all procedures that process personal data 
must be documented."
"These records contain general information about the procedure according to 
clearly defined criteria that are necessary to meet proper documentation."
"The records are reportable 
and regularly reviewed."
"We also track the quality of our data protection compliance level based on the annual recertification of 
our DPMS by the BSI."
"SAP has been audited by the BSI annually and awarded certifications according 
to BS 10012 since 2011."
The most recent certification is valid until end of 2025.
"SAP’s own quality standards and international regulations require careful selection and monitoring of 
subprocessors processing personal data on behalf of SAP and SAP customers."
"With the goal that all 
subprocessors meet data protection and security requirements for the processing of personal data, 
SAP has implemented a subprocessor verification process that is part of the overall SAP Third-Party 
Risk Management framework."
"SAP respects the rights of the data subjects to obtain information as to whether personal data 
concerning them is being processed."
"All necessary information is made available to the data subjects 
within the framework of the privacy statements on the respective SAP Web sites."
"In 2023, there were two notifiable data protection incidents in accordance with the GDPR for data that 
SAP processes for its own purposes and were reported to the supervisory authorities."

"Aiming for a highly engaged, diverse, future-fit workforce 
equipped with the right skills helps SAP attract and retain the best talent."
"As part of People & Operations, our People Strategy connects with our go-to-market and product 
strategies, bringing together the essential fabric of SAP’s transformation: our people, processes, and 
technology."
"Since 2020, we have been evolving our annual execution of our People Strategy, which

How We Measure and Manage Our Performance 
The impact of our People Strategy is measured by seven KPIs (see table “Our Key People-Related KPIs

"17 Both links lead to information that was not part of the statutory audit or the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our 
external auditor."
"18 82,651 employees participated in the #Unfiltered survey in April (response rate: 76%), and 78,041 employees participated in the 
#Unfiltered survey in October (response rate: 71%)."
"All headcount (HC)-relevant employees and, in addition, in Germany, the non-HC relevant

Our Key People-Related KPIs at a Glance20 
 
Below is an overview of how we put the three themes of our People Strategy and the KPIs into 
practice."
"Build SAP’s Skills for the Future  
SAP is committed to accelerating cloud growth."
This requires workforce upskilling and expansion.
"Attracting, hiring, onboarding, developing, and retaining top talent is vital for our future success."
"In 2023, 
we focused on internal roles and strategic investment areas to support our transformation and long-
term growth."
"The competitive talent market underscores the need to further communicate our 
Employer Value Proposition, encourage employee ambassadorship, and promote referrals."
"We 
remain committed to fostering inclusivity across generations, genders, nationalities, and more, to 
ensure a rich and diverse workforce."

"20 Employee Engagement Index: For more information, see the Performance Management System section."
"The Employee Engagement Index 
target range for 2023 was 76% to 80%; this range will also be the target for 2024."
"Leadership Trust Net Promoter Score: for more information, see the Performance Management System section."
"Business Health Culture Index (BHCI): Indicates the extent to which SAP successfully offers employees a working environment that promotes 
health, and supports their long-term employability and their active engagement in reaching our corporate goals."
"The index covers questions 
concerning how employees rate their personal well-being, the working conditions at SAP, and our leadership culture."
"The BHCI is calculated 
based on the results of our #Unfiltered program (April 2023 survey)."
"For 2024 through 2025, our ambition remains to keep the BHCI between 
78% and 80%."
Innovation Index: Indicates to what extent we foster an innovation culture.
"The index is measured by three questions in our #Unfiltered 
program (April 2023 survey)."
Simplification of Processes: Shows the impact of our continued efforts to simplify our processes.
"The index is measured by nine questions in 
our #Unfiltered program (October 2023 survey)."
"Employee Retention: Ratio of the average number of employees minus the employees who left voluntarily, to the average number of 
employees, taking into account the past 12 months (in full-time equivalents, or FTEs)."
This ratio puts emphasis on employee-initiated turnover.
"In other words, we seek to measure how many employees choose to stay with SAP."
"As opposed to keeping a low turnover rate, we aim to 
keep our retention rate high."
"The number of employees who left voluntarily excludes those who left voluntarily as part of restructuring-related 
departures, for more transparency and precise headcount management purposes."
"Women in Management: We define “women in management” as the share of women in management positions as compared to the total 
number of managers, expressed by the number of individuals and not FTEs."
"It includes three categories: 1) Managers managing teams: Refers 
to managing teams of at least one employee or vacant position; 2) Managers managing managers: Refers to managing managers who manage 
teams; and 3) Executive Board members."
"For 2023, we kept our ambition to increase the rate of women in management to 30%."
"Our 
aspiration is to reach gender parity in our workforce at all levels and to retain women leaders."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F

For 2023, it remained our ambition to have 30% of management roles held by women."
"Our aspiration is 
to reach gender parity in our workforce at all levels and to retain women leaders."
"As part of our strategic pillar “Build SAP’s Skills for the Future,” we focus on the skills transformation of 
our workforce."
"We have established one unified skills library, and are working to unify existing skills 
management tools to implement one single platform, SAP SuccessFactors, for all employees."
"This will 
enable greater skills transparency, data-driven workforce planning, and intentional upskilling, as well as 
enhance our processes from hire to retire."
"Our learning strategy is closely aligned with our product and customer strategies to drive cohesive, 
skill-based development for both our ecosystem and our workforce."
"Early Talent21 hires and 
pipeline programs

- Ensure fair pay through annual, global reviews of our pay ranges and pay equity, and centrally-funded pay adjustments, so 
that all employees are within their pay range and acceptable spread of pay differences with peers."
"Overall participation 
was 75% in 2023 (2022: 79%) with a collective investment of 6,710,033 shares (2022: 9,183,599)."
- Increase transparency for employees on their holistic rewards offerings – from pay to benefits and equity.
"Employees now 
have transparency into their own pay ranges (99.8% of all employees) and the value of top benefits offerings (66% of all 
employees)."
"For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (B.3)."
"At SAP, we strive to be the world’s most inclusive workplace, aiming to create a unique culture where 
everyone feels a sense of belonging, and human differences are celebrated and valued."
"As a global organization with employees from 160 nationalities, we strive to consider the full spectrum 
of human differences and promote inclusion for each one of them (for example, inclusion of gender, 
race, LGBTQ+, generations, disability, and many other diversities)."
"Our Diversity & Inclusion Strategy is 
built on three pillars:  
– Workforce Diversity: We believe in leveraging the widest spectrum of human differences that 
represent a diversity of identities, thoughts, and perspectives to create business outcomes that help 
the world run better every day."
"– Workplace Inclusion: We foster a work environment where colleagues can thrive and engage to 
their fullest potential in driving SAP’s purpose."

"Carbon-neutral cloud 
solutions and 
product-in-use 
emissions 
The vast majority of our overall carbon emissions result from the use of our software."
"To address this, we aim to help our 
customers, hardware providers, and others to run more energy-efficient operations."
"• By powering all data centers with 100% renewable electricity,50 we offer our customers carbon-neutral51 cloud software 
solutions and help them reduce their overall carbon emissions (upstream scope 3)."
"• We collaborate with customers to optimize their on-premise landscapes so that they consume less energy (for example, we 
decommission legacy systems, archive unused data, consolidate business applications, and virtualize their system 
landscapes)."
"Supply Chain 
Environmentally 
conscious 
procurement  
• Multi-phased supply chain engagement program: We partner with (top) suppliers to procure low carbon and energy-efficient 
products and services to reduce their environmental footprint throughout the supply chain."
• We consider environmental requirements in procurement processes and decisions.
"For more information, see the Sustainable Procurement section."
"Fostering 
biodiversity and 
nature-based 
solutions to climate 
change 
• Intact forests help to slow climate change, safeguard biodiversity, and provide critical ecosystem services to people."
"Thus, 
reforestation projects are one part of SAP’s climate action plan."
"• Since 2012, SAP has helped to plant over 16.3 million trees to support ecosystem restoration and sustainable development."
SAP will continue to finance nature-based solutions and is committed to planting 21 million trees by the end of 2025.
"• By applying strict quality criteria, SAP aims to support initiatives which restore and protect the right trees in the right places 
and have a positive impact on the local community, biodiversity, and climate."
"• Since 2021, SAP has been part of the 1t.org Corporate Alliance, which mobilizes business leaders to responsibly conserve, 
restore, and grow trees worldwide while pursuing the 1.5 degrees Celsius science-based target."
"Operations 
Running SAP facilities 
with 100% renewable 
electricity 
Since 2014, SAP has been running all its offices and data centers52 with 100% renewable electricity in alignment with our 
commitment toward the RE100 initiative."
"For this, we use two strategic levers: 
• We invest in high-quality, EKOenergy-certified EACs53 to foster renewable energy generation."
"• We produce renewable electricity in selected SAP locations worldwide through solar panels (such as in Palo Alto, CA, in the 
United States, Bangalore, India, and Mougins, France)."
"At SAP’s headquarters, we are in the process of implementing an on-
site Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) solar project with the aim of increasing the share of renewable electricity self-
produced on-site and achieving price stability."
"• As a potential third lever, we are running a green tariff pilot in Australia to power our local facilities with renewable electricity 
(bundled EACs)."
"This approach allows us to reduce our entire electricity-consumption-related emissions (2023: 256 kt in total; 161 kt by SAP and 
95 kt by suppliers; 2022: 257 kt)."
"Going forward, we aim to expand the usage of Power Purchase Agreements for sourcing 
renewable electricity."
"ISO 14001 
• SAP’s environmental management system (EMS) is implemented in over 45 sites in 26 countries worldwide and certified 
by the internationally recognized ISO 14001:2015 standard."
"In 2023, we successfully maintained this certification."
• Target: Increase EMS scope to 100% of SAP’s major company-owned sites by 2025 (2023: 86%).
"ISO 50001 
• SAP’s headquarters in Germany and North America and 100% of SAP’s own major data centers (St."
"Leon-Rot and 
Walldorf in Germany, and Colorado Springs and Newtown Square in the United States) operate an ISO 50001:2018-
certified energy management system."
"49 For more insight into our sustainability software portfolio, see SAP’s Web site (link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory 
audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor)."
"50 We achieve this by leveraging 1) investments in high-quality, EKOenergy-certified EACs, and 2) renewables produced on-site."
"The term “data 
center” refers to both SAP-owned and external data centers (co-location data centers and hyperscalers)."
51 Relating to the electricity consumed by cloud solutions from SAP only.
52 The term “data center” refers to both SAP-owned and external data centers (co-location data centers and hyperscalers).
"53 For more information, see section Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance."
"• Centralization of the cooling distribution system at SAP’s headquarters in Germany will allow the usage of environmentally 
friendly operating fluids and sector coupling (conversion of surplus energy into cooling energy by absorption chillers and 
use of heat pumps for room cooling)."
"Electricity for the cooling system will be derived primarily from renewable sources 
(such as solar)."
"Global car fleet: 
Transition to electric 
or zero-emission 
vehicles 
From 2025 onwards, all new company cars for employees are planned to be emission-free.55 At the end of 2023, about 
14% of our global car fleet comprised emission-free vehicles."
"SAP also promotes various incentives to accelerate this change, 
for example: 
• We power all SAP-owned charging stations at SAP locations with 100% renewable electricity."
"• For larger vehicle fleets such as in Germany, the Netherlands, and others, we offer employees a subsidy to install a charging 
point at home, and reimburse them for the electricity consumed."
"As far as legally possible and factually reasonable, we will 
offer similar subsidies in all countries."
"• In some countries, we offer our employees a discount or a higher budget if they choose an all-electric vehicle."
"• We continually expand SAP’s global charging infrastructure (2023: 1,650+ charging stations; 2022: 1,100+ charging stations)."
"Alternative 
commuting 
To generate a shift in commuting habits and foster inter-/multimodal mobility, we continue to offer various programs, such as: 
• Company bicycle leasing programs: Employees can lease bicycles with the option of purchasing them after contract end."
"Such programs have already been established in Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg."
"• Successful role out of a flexible mobility budget in spring 2023 as a regular mobility alternative in Germany (2023: about 
1,950 participants)."
"Participants receive a fixed monthly mobility budget to use any mode of transport to commute to work or 
in their leisure time (bicycle, e-scooter, rental car, train, bus, and so on)."
"Business flights 
• We avoid business flights by investing in virtual collaboration and communication technologies."
"• In 2016, we began charging an internal carbon price for business flights, which we invest in high-quality carbon offset 
projects to counterbalance the carbon emissions these flights cause."
"By annually increasing the carbon price per flight ticket 
that is charged to the organizational cost center, we seek to incentivize the organizational units and employees to fly less or 
to choose an alternative, sustainable mode of travel."
"This voluntary investment in certified carbon offsets helped SAP 
reach its carbon-neutrality goal in 2023."
"Carbon Project Portfolio and Long-Term Commitments 
 
54 The PUE is a ratio that describes the efficiency of a data center, with 1.0 being the ideal ratio."
55 “Emission-free” refers to vehicles that do not emit exhaust gas or other pollutants from the onboard source of power.
"These vehicles will 
gradually replace out of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICEV) as company cars."
"56 Investments in projects and the corresponding carbon offsets represent a unit of reduced, avoided, or removed GHG emissions."
"57 To finance our investments in high-quality carbon offset projects (for example, certified by the Gold Standard) and EACs, we leverage the 
collected internal air travel fees charged on business flights."

"By year end 2023, SAP had invested approximately 42% of the total commitment."
"• The funds prefinance community-based ecosystem restoration, agroforestry, biodiversity preservation, and clean energy 
projects in developing countries."
"This diligent procurement 
approach helps SAP mitigate the risk of procuring non-genuine carbon emission reductions while reinforcing our own quality 
expectations (for more information, see the Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance section)."
"– Vulnerability analysis of our own data centers with high exposures helped us identify the impact

"Economy and the Market 
The global economy expanded at a moderate but steady pace in 2023, describes the European 
Central Bank (ECB) in its most recent Economic Bulletin.1 It attributes this development to strong 
private consumption and the support of resilient labor markets."
"Concerning the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) region, the euro area economy grew minimally over 
the first half of 2023, reports the ECB."
"In the second half of the year, real GDP contracted slightly, 
mostly due to a decline in inventories but also because of subdued confidence, low competitiveness, 
renewed geopolitical tensions, and tighter financing conditions."
"However, services activity grew 
modestly and contributed positively to growth in the second half of the year."
"In the Americas region, U.S."
economic growth showed more resilience than previously anticipated.
"Despite significant tightening of monetary policy, the United States showed a solid domestic demand 
and a strong labor market and, with significant government spending, reached a robust growth, states 
the ECB."
"As for the APJ (Asia Pacific Japan) region, Chinese economic activity stabilized in 2023, driven by 
stronger consumer spending."
"The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions at the beginning of the year and a 
broader recovery in private consumption compensated for weakness in the Chinese residential sector."
"In Japan, however, real GDP growth contracted in 2023, as high inflation weighed on activity and 
consumption."
"However, growth returned to a slightly positive yet modest territory in the fourth quarter, 
states the ECB."

The IT Market 
“The digital business era has arrived."
"Spending on digital technologies is growing while traditional, 
nondigital spending is stagnating or even slightly dropping."
"The demand for digital experiences from 
customers, employees, partners, and suppliers has shifted to an expectation."
"Companies looking to 
sustain and grow are seeking digital revenue streams while looking to digitize operations to reduce 
costs and increase efficiency.”2 This is how International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S.-based market 
research firm, summarizes the current IT market situation."
"Therefore, reports IDC, “in the post-pandemic 
environment, digital-first strategies have moved from being a competitive advantage to being the basic 
standard needed for survival."
"Legacy systems are increasingly proving to be bottlenecks, hindering 
real-time data access and agile response mechanisms."
"As these technologies have matured, they offer organizations unprecedented capabilities to 
drive innovation, optimize processes, and uncover actionable insights."
"In today’s business climate, ESG considerations are no 
longer just a checklist."
"[…] These are factoring in and becoming integral components to a company’s 
strategic plans.”4 In IDC’s view, therefore, “sustainability is increasingly linked to digital business […]."

"Impact on SAP 
Despite macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, SAP again showed high resilience and 
all regions contributed positively to the results."
"The wind-down of business operations in Russia and 
Belarus was nearly completed in the first quarter of 2023 and remaining contract obligations were 
reduced to a non-material volume by the end of the year."
"After two years of significant investments to accelerate SAP’s transition to the cloud (the so-called 
phase one), the second phase of our cloud transformation started in January 2023 with the publication 
of our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022."
"At that time, SAP showed the passing of the 
tipping point towards positive profitability (non-IFRS), as planned and predicted in the strategy update 
that was communicated in October 2020."
"Continuous execution along the midterm ambition and forthcoming positive results over the remaining 
quarters in 2023 underpinned SAP’s commitment to the corporate strategy."
"The focus on efficiencies 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
66 
 
and disciplined spending resulted in a significant expansion of its cloud gross margins (non-IFRS) 
throughout the year."
SAP has been an early adopter of AI technology.
"During the SAP Sapphire conference in May, the 
Company showcased the use of AI in various products."
"At the beginning of the second half of 2023, the 
Company announced strategic direct investments in three leading generative AI companies."
"The 
investments underscore SAP’s open ecosystem approach to AI, which is aimed at leveraging the best 
technology to embed AI across SAP’s portfolio."
"The Company anticipates significant possibilities for 
market expansion through these technologies and new premium offerings."
"Performance Against Our Outlook for 2023 (Non-IFRS) 
As in previous years, our 2023 operating profit-related goals and published outlook were based on our 
non-IFRS financial measures at constant currencies."
"For this reason, in the following section we discuss 
performance against our outlook in terms of non-IFRS numbers, unless otherwise stated, (at constant 
currencies) derived from IFRS measures."
"The subsequent section about International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) operating results discusses numbers only in terms of IFRS, so the numbers 
in that section are not expressly identified as IFRS numbers."
"Furthermore, we expected 
operating profit (non-IFRS) to range between €8.8 billion and €9.1 billion and a free cash flow of 
approximately €5.0 billion."
"We expected a full-year 2023 effective tax rate (IFRS) of 28.0% to 32.0% 
(2022: 32.0%) and an effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of 26.0% to 28.0% (2022: 29.6%), strongly depending 
on the development of Sapphire Ventures’ investments."
"This initial outlook reflected SAP executing on 
its cloud strategy, which is driving the accelerated cloud growth through both new business and cloud 
adoption by existing customers, scaling SAP’s cloud momentum towards its midterm ambition."
"In April 2023, we adjusted our outlook for continuing operations, reflecting the expected Qualtrics 
divestiture."
"We thereafter expected cloud revenue to range between €14.0 billion and €14.4 billion, 
cloud and software revenue to range between €26.9 billion and €27.4 billion, and operating profit (non-
IFRS) to range between €8.6 billion and €8.9 billion."
"Furthermore, we adjusted the anticipated share of 
more predictable revenue to 82% and thereafter expected a free cash flow of approximately 
€4.9 billion."
"In July 2023, to reflect then-current market development, we updated and tightened our ranges 
slightly."
"In October 2023, SAP reaffirmed its July 2023 outlook."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F

2023 Actual Revenue and Profit Performance Compared to Outlook (Non-
IFRS) 
Cloud revenue is within the range of our revised 2023 outlook, with the combined cloud and software 
and operating profit exceeding the upper end of our outlook range."
"Our current cloud backlog (contractually committed cloud revenue that we expect to recognize over 
the upcoming 12 months) reached €13.75 billion at actual currencies (€14.04 billion at constant 
currencies; 2022: €11.73 billion at constant currencies)."
"This was an increase of 25% (27% on a 
constant currency basis; 2022: 24%)."
"The growth rate of our current cloud backlog is in line with our 
guidance from the year before to achieve a growth rate similar to 2022, while at a larger scale."
"On December 31, 2023, total cloud backlog was up 37% to €44.25 billion (up 39% to €45.09 billion at 
constant currencies)."
"At constant currencies, the resulting cloud revenue grew from €10.67 billion in 2022 to €14.06 billion in 
2023, in line with our guidance range of €14.0 billion to €14.2 billion."
"That represented an increase of 
23% at constant currencies."
"Cloud and software revenue grew 9% at constant currencies to €27.64 billion (2022: €24.01 billion), 
and thus ended higher than our revised outlook range forecasted for 2023 of €27.0 billion to 
€27.4 billion."
"Thanks to the strong increase in cloud business, we were able to increase the share of more 
predictable revenue 2pp to 81% (2022: 79%), which is 1pp below our revised outlook."
Total revenue on a constant currency basis grew 9% in 2023 to €32.03 billion (2022: €27.90 billion).
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
68 
 
Operating expenses (non-IFRS) on a constant currency basis increased 7% in 2023 to €22.99 billion 
(2022: €20.23 billion)."
Our expense base in 2023 was impacted by our transformation to a fast-growing cloud business.
"The 
cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) for 2023 was 72.6%, increasing 2.2pp at constant currencies year over 
year."
"Our cloud margin benefitted from an increase in cloud revenue and significantly lower 
investments in the Next-Generation Cloud Delivery initiative (modernization of our cloud delivery to 
enable a more resilient and scalable cloud infrastructure)."
"Our overall headcount increased by 1,291 full-time equivalents, or FTEs (732 thereof organically), 
primarily in the functional areas Research and Development and Cloud."
"Non-IFRS operating profit in 2023 was €9.04 billion on a constant currency basis (2022: €7.67 billion), 
reflecting an increase of 13%."
"Operating profit and margin benefitted from accelerated growth in 
revenue, completion of the Next Generation Cloud Delivery initiative, and strict cost management."
"Thus, non-IFRS operating profit came in above the target range (€8.65 billion to €8.95 billion)."
"We achieved an effective tax rate (IFRS) of 32.6% and an effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of 29.3%, which is 
above the outlook of 28.0% to 32.0% (IFRS) and 26.0% to 28.0% (non-IFRS)."
"This mainly resulted from 
changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets."

"Our software licenses revenue declined €292 million from €2,056 million in 2022 to €1,764 million in 
2023."
"The demand for SAP software helped us maintain a stable maintenance customer base for software 
support, resulting in software support revenue of €11,496 million in 2023 (2022: €11,909 million)."
"The 
slight decline is attributable to the accelerated transition of our customers to the cloud and to 
unfavorable currency exchange rates."
"SAP Enterprise Support was the largest contributor to our 
software support revenue."

"Services revenue increased €155 million, or 4%, from €4,128 million in 2022 to €4,283 million in 2023."
"This increase was predominantly caused by very strong growth across the entire services portfolio of 
offerings with accelerated growth in our premium support revenues."
"At the same time, the revenue 
development was positively impacted by a year-over-year increase in order entry."
"Consulting revenue and premium support revenue increased €165 million, or 4%, from €3,709 million

"Software licenses and software support revenue 
decreased from €2,377 million in 2022 to €2,156 million in 2023."
"Operating profit was impacted by a reduced contribution from software licenses revenue and from 
increased total operating expenses."
"Share-based payment expenses increased to €2,220 million 
(2022: €1,431 million), mainly due to an increase in the SAP share price of more than €40 from 
January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023 (January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022: drop in the SAP share 
price of around €30)."
"A shorter contract life for on-premise support contracts led to accelerated 
amortization of costs related to these contracts, resulting in higher amortization expenses amounting 
to €121 million for 2023 (2022: €0 million)."
"Furthermore, higher personnel costs were driven by higher 
bonus expenses prompted by strong revenue growth and robust attainment of other bonus measures."
"In addition, the recognition of a provision for fines in regard to anti-bribery matters led to expenses of 
€155 million in 2023 (2022: €0 million)."
"Operating profit was also impacted by investments in the Next-
Generation Cloud Delivery campaign and in other research and development and sales and marketing 
initiatives to capture current and future growth opportunities."

"Software licenses and software support revenue decreased 5% to €13,261 million 
(2022: €13,965 million), primarily attributable to a 14% decline in software revenue."
"Software licenses 
and software support costs remained relatively constant year over year at €1,383 million 
(2022: €1,384 million)."
"Cost of Services 
Cost of services consists primarily of the cost of consulting, premium services, and training courses, 
and the cost of bought-in consulting and training resources."
"The cost of services increased 8% to 
€3,407 million (2022: €3,155 million), in line with increased demand for project consulting and premium 
engagement services as well as higher business travel costs as COVID-related travel restrictions further 
eased around the world."
"Our gross margin on services, defined as services profit as a percentage of 
services revenue, decreased 3.1pp to 20.5% (2022: 23.6%)."
"As our services business trends away from 
traditional software licensing and consulting revenue toward more subscription revenue from cloud 
solutions, we continue to adjust our service delivery resources to support our cloud offerings."
"The R&D expense rose 4% to €6,324 million in 2023 from €6,080 million in 2022."
"This increase was 
mainly due to higher personnel costs driven by a 3% year-over-year growth in our R&D headcount for 
additional capacity demands in relation to the increased revenue."
"The R&D expense was also 
impacted by several initiatives to capture current and future growth opportunities."
"R&D expense as a 
percentage of total revenue decreased to 20.3% in 2023 (2022: 20.6%)."
"For more information, see the 
Our Investments in Innovation section."
"Sales and Marketing Expense 
Sales and marketing expense consists mainly of personnel costs, direct sales costs, and the cost of 
marketing our products and services."
"Our sales and marketing expense grew 11% from €7,946 million in 2022 to €8,828 million in 2023."
"This 
increase is mainly attributable to higher personnel costs due to higher bonus payments prompted by 
strong revenue growth."
"In addition, travel costs for sales teams increased as COVID-related global 
travel restrictions accelerated to ease."
"Accordingly, the ratio of sales and marketing expense to total revenue, expressed as a percentage, 
increased 1.4pp in 2023 to 28.3% (2022: 26.9%)."
"General and Administration Expense 
Our general and administration expense consists mainly of personnel costs to support our finance and 
administration, human resource, and corporate functions."
"General and administration expense increased 6% from €1,289 million in 2022 to €1,364 million in 
2023."
"This increase is primarily due to higher personnel expenses in 2023, the majority thereof due to 
higher bonus payments."
"The ratio of general and administration expense to total revenue was flat year 
over year at 4.4% (2022: 4.4%)."

"The Applications, Technology & Services segment recorded a strong increase in cloud revenue of 20% 
in 2023 (24% at constant currencies), supported by SAP Business Technology Platform as well as 
SAP S/4HANA, whose cloud revenue increased 67% (72% at constant currencies) to €3,495 million."
"Cost of cloud for the Applications, Technology & Services segment increased 10% (13% at constant 
currencies), which overall caused the cloud gross margin to widen 2.7pp (2.9pp at constant currencies) 
to 70.5%."
"Thereof, PaaS and SaaS cloud gross margins grew 3.9pp and 1.5pp at constant currencies, 
which resulted in a cloud gross margin of 84.7% and 70.1% respectively."
"Software support revenue 
slightly decreased by 3% (1% at constant currencies) to €11,495 million in 2023."
"Software licenses 
revenue decreased 14% (12% at constant currencies) mainly due to the shift toward cloud revenue."
"As 
such, the segment achieved a total software licenses and support revenue of €13,259 million."
"Total 
segment revenue nevertheless rose 5% (8% at constant currencies) and ended 2023 at 
€30,057 million."
"Overall, the share of more predictable revenue within the Applications, Technology & Services 
segment increased 1.6pp from 78.4% in 2022 to 80.0% in 2023."
"Cost of revenue increased 5% (8% at constant currencies) compared to the prior year, ending 2023 at 
€7,951 million."
This development was mainly driven by an increase in cost of cloud.
"Consequently, segment profit increased 11% (15% at constant currencies) and reached €9,811 million 
in 2023, whereas segment margin improved 1.7pp (1.9pp at constant currencies)."

Cost of Cloud and Software 
In 2022, the cost of cloud and software increased 8% to €4,883 million (2021: €4,479 million) and our 
cloud margin increased 2.5pp from 66.9% in 2021 to 69.4% in 2022."
"Cost of cloud benefitted from a 
reorganization within our Customer Success organization, under which cloud delivery resources were 
reallocated to sales roles focused on the implementation of our LACE (land adopt consume expand) 
strategy."
"This reorganization reduced the 2022 cost of cloud and, as a consequence, increased our 
sales and marketing expenses by approximately €40 million."
"Cost of cloud continued to be negatively 
impacted by investments in the Next-Generation Cloud Delivery initiative, which was completed mid-
2023."
"The software licenses and software support margin was 90.1%, 1.0pp above the prior year level (2021: 
89.1%)."
"Software licenses and software support revenue decreased 5% to €13,965 million (2021: 
€14,660 million), primarily arising from a 37% decline in software revenue."
"Software licenses and 
software support costs decreased correspondingly by 13% to €1,384 million (2021: €1,598 million)."
"Cost of Services 
The cost of services increased 15% to €3,155 million (2021: €2,740 million), in line with increased 
demand for project consulting and premium engagement services as well as higher business travel 
costs as COVID related travelling restrictions eased around the world."
"Our gross margin on services, 
defined as services profit as a percentage of services revenue, decreased slightly by 0.1pp to 23.6% 
(2021: 23.7%)."

"Research and Development 
The R&D expense rose 15% to €6,080 million in 2022 from €5,270 million in 2021."
"This increase arises 
mainly from higher personnel costs driven by a 6% year over year growth in our R&D headcount for 
additional capacity demands in relation to the increased revenue."
"The R&D expense is also impacted

by continued strategic investments in Next-Generation Cloud Delivery campaign and several other 
initiatives to capture current and future growth opportunities."

in Innovation section."
"Sales and Marketing Expense 
Our sales and marketing expense grew 16% from €6,856 million in 2021 to €7,946 million in 2022."
"This 
increase is for the most part attributable to the 6% growth in headcount from expansion of the global 
sales force as well as from higher bonus payments prompted by strong revenue growth."
"In addition, 
travel costs for sales teams increased as COVID related travel restrictions eased around the world."
"Similarly, marketing costs increased in 2022 as some of the marketing events resumed."
"Sales expenses 
were also impacted by the reorganization of our Customer Success organization to focus on the 
implementation of the LACE strategy."

increased 1.5pp in 2022 to 26.9% (2021: 25.4%)."
"General and Administration Expense 
General and administration expense increased 9% from €1,187 million in 2021 to €1,289 million in 
2022."
This increase is primarily due to higher expenses from share-based payment expenses in 2022.

"Software support revenue increased 4% but 
remained flat at constant currencies level compared to the prior year, ending 2022 at €11,908 million."

"Foreign Currency Exchange 
Rate Exposure 
Although our reporting currency is the euro, a significant portion of our business is conducted in 
currencies other than the euro."
"Since the Group’s entities usually conduct their business in their 
respective functional currencies, our risk of exchange rate fluctuations from ongoing ordinary 
operations is not considered significant."
"For more information about foreign currencies and 
our hedging activities, see Note (F.1) and Note (IN.1)."
"Approximately 74% of our total revenue in 2023 (2022: 73%) was attributable to operations in non-
euro participating countries."
We translated that revenue into euros for financial reporting purposes.
"Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro had an unfavorable impact of € 826 million on our total 
revenue for 2023, a favorable impact of €1,620 million on our total revenue for 2022 and an 
unfavorable impact of €375 million on our total revenue for 2021."
"The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations discussed in the preceding paragraph is 
calculated by translating current period figures in local currency to euros at the monthly average 
exchange rate for the corresponding month in the prior year."
"Our revenue analysis, included within the 
“Operating Results” section of Item 5, discusses at times the effect of currency movements which are 
calculated in the same manner."
"Liquidity and Capital 
Resources 
Finances (IFRS) 
Overview 
Global Financial Management 
We use global centralized financial management to control liquid assets and monitor exposure to 
interest rates and currencies."
"The primary aim of our financial management is to maintain liquidity in 
the Group at a level that is adequate to meet our financial obligations at all times."
"Most SAP entities 
have their liquidity managed centrally by the Group, so that liquid assets across the Group can be 
consolidated, monitored, and invested in accordance with Group policy."
"High levels of liquid assets 
help keep SAP flexible, sound, and independent."
"In addition, various credit facilities are currently 
available for additional liquidity, if required."
"For more information about these facilities, see the Credit 
Facilities section."
"We manage credit, liquidity, interest rate, equity price, and foreign exchange rate risks on a Group-wide 
basis."
"We use selected derivatives exclusively for this purpose and not for speculation, which is 
defined as entering into a derivative instrument for which we do not have corresponding underlying 
transactions."
"The rules for the use of derivatives and other rules and processes concerning the 
management of financial risks are documented in our Treasury Guideline, which applies globally to all 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F

companies in the Group."
"For more information about the management of each financial risk and about 
our risk exposure, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes (F.1) and (F.2)."
"Capital Structure Management 
The primary objective of our capital structure management is to maintain a strong financial profile for 
investor, creditor, and customer confidence, and to support the growth of our business."
"We seek to 
maintain a capital structure that will enable us to cover our funding requirements through the capital 
markets at reasonable conditions, and in so doing, ensure a high level of independence , and financial 
flexibility."
"For more information about the capital structure and its analysis, see the Analysis of 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position section and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, Note (E.1)."
"The long-term credit rating for SAP SE is “A2” by Moody’s (positive outlook) and “A+” by Standard & 
Poor’s (stable outlook)."
"On May 16, 2023, SAP announced a new share repurchase program with an aggregate volume of up to 
€5 billion and a term until December 31, 2025."

7,563,796 shares at an average price of €125.49, with payouts of approximately €949 million under the 
program in 2023."
"Repurchased shares will primarily be used to service future awards granted under 
the ‘Move SAP’ share-based compensation plan."
"Liquidity Management 
Our primary source of cash, cash equivalents, and current investments is funds generated from our 
business operations."
"Over the past several years, our principal use of cash has been to support 
operations and our capital expenditure requirements resulting from our growth, to quickly repay 
financial debt, to acquire businesses, to pay dividends on our shares, and to buy back SAP shares on 
the open market."
"On December 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments were 
primarily held in euros and U.S."
"Our investments in financial assets of issuers with a credit rating 
lower than BBB were not material in 2023."
"It may also be necessary to enter into financing 
transactions when additional funds are required that cannot be wholly sourced from free cash flow, to 
maintain flexibility, and/or limit repayment risk."
"Therefore, we continuously monitor funding options available in the capital markets and trends in the 
availability of funds, as well as the cost of such funding."
"In recent years, we were able to repay 
additional debt within a short period of time due to our persistently strong free cash flow."

"With post-COVID-19 growth momentum waning, 
the services sector, which had previously proven resilient, might also show a greater deceleration in 
2024."
"Concerning the EMEA region, economic growth in the euro area might remain subdued in the near 
term, as interest rate increases could tighten financing conditions and dampen demand, but at the 
same time help push down inflation."
"However, these effects are likely to fade later on in the projection 
period because of rising real incomes and improving foreign demand, suggests the ECB."
"It also expects 
services activity in the EMEA region to soften in the coming months due to spillovers from weaker 
industrial activity, fading effects from the reopening of the economy, and the broadening impact of 
tighter financing conditions."
"As for the Americas region, the ECB predicts that while economic growth in the United States could 
moderate in the near term as tighter monetary policy might restrain spending, the U.S."

recover again from the second half of 2024 onward."
"For the APJ region, the ECB’s growth outlook remains broadly unrevised with respect to emerging Asia

change."
"Nevertheless, SAP’s resilience is remarkable and with 83% of our revenue recurring, the 
Company is able to withstand economic pressure to a large degree."
"Even so, SAP must continue to 
evolve and remain agile while continuously adapting to a fast-changing landscape."
"In 2024 and beyond, SAP plans to execute along the refined corporate strategy, with increasing focus 
on key strategic growth areas, such as cloud adoption, SAP Business AI, and value for customers."
"This 
makes us confident in our ability to expand our addressable market and deliver sustained topline 
growth."

Financial Targets and Prospects 
Revenue and Operating Profit Targets and Prospects (Non-IFRS) 
Outlook 2024 
The outlook for 2024 has been prepared in accordance with our updated non-IFRS definition from 
2024."
"For more information, see the Performance Management System section."
– Free cash flow of approximately €3.5 billion (2023: €5.09 billion).
"– An effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of around 32.0% (2023: 30.3%, based on the updated non-IFRS 
definition) 
Furthermore, SAP provides the following additional forward-looking information for selected metrics: 
– CCB: we expect a year-end growth rate similar that of 2023, while at a larger scale."
– Cloud ERP Suite revenue: we expect to sustain the high growth rate in 2024.
"While SAP’s full-year 2024 business outlook is at constant currencies, numbers reported in actual 
currencies are likely to be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations as the year progresses."
"See the 
table below for the expected currency impacts for the full-year 2024."
"These expectations are based on 
the December 2023 level."
"We do not provide an outlook for the effective tax rate (IFRS) due to the uncertainty and potential 
variability of gains and losses associated with equity investments, which are reconciling items between 
non-IFRS and IFRS."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
93 
 
Proposed Dividend 
In 2024, we intend to pay a dividend of €2.20 per share (subject to shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Shareholders Meeting in May 2024)."
"For more information, see the Financial Performance: 
Review and Analysis section."
"Ambition 2025 
In this section, all numbers (except cloud revenue and total revenue) are based exclusively on non-
IFRS measures."
Our Ambition for 2025 has been adjusted in accordance with our updated non-IFRS definition applicable from 2024.
"For more 
information, see the Performance Management System section."
"Note: For a reconciliation of non-IFRS results to IFRS equivalents, see the Performance Management System section."
"Investment Goals 
Our planned investment expenditures for 2024 and 2025, other than for business combinations, 
consist primarily of the purchase of IT infrastructure and the construction activities described in Item 4."
Information about SAP – Description of Property.
"We expect investments in IT infrastructure to be 
approximately €400 million and in construction activities to be approximately €350 million in 2024."
"In 
2024, we expect total capital expenditures of approximately €950 million."
"In 2025, capital expenditures 
are expected to decrease to approximately €700 million."
"Goals for Liquidity and Finance 
As of December 31, 2023, our net liquidity was €3.5 billion."
"In 2024, we expect a free cash flow of approximately €3.5 billion (compared to €5.1 billion in 2023) and 
of around €8.0 billion in 2025."
"The decline in free cash flow in 2024 will be driven predominantly by our 
preliminary €2.0 billion estimated outflow for restructuring, a €200 million outflow for compliance 
matters, and a €200 million adverse impact due to the discontinuation of the SAP-triggered financing 
program."
"In 2024, we intend to repay €850 million in Eurobonds and US$323 million in U.S."
"The ratio of net debt as of December 31, 2023, divided by the total of operating profit (IFRS) plus 
depreciation and amortization was –0.49x and therefore below our 2023 target of 0.5x."
"Non-Financial Goals for 2024 and Ambition for 2025 
In addition to our financial goals, we also focus on four non-financial targets: customer loyalty, 
employee engagement, carbon impact, and women in executive roles."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
94 
 
For 2024, SAP expects employee engagement, measured by the Employee Engagement Index, to be 
between 76% and 80% (2023: 80%)."
"Through 2025, we aim to achieve a steady increase in our 
Employee Engagement Index score."
SAP measures customer loyalty using the Customer Net Promoter Score (Customer NPS).
"We expect 
the score to be between 9 and 13 for Customer NPS in 2024."
"SAP expects to steadily increase the 
Customer NPS through 2025."
"In 2024, we expect to steadily decrease carbon emissions across the relevant value chain."
"Further, SAP 
has also committed to achieving net-zero along our value chain in line with a 1.5 degrees Celsius future 
in 2030."
"From 2024, SAP will track a new KPI: Women in Executive Roles (WiER)."
"For 2024 and beyond, we are 
expecting to steadily increase the percentage of women on Global Executive Team, Senior Executive 
Team, and Executive Team level as we strive to achieve our target of 25% by the end of 2027."
"Premises on Which Our Outlook and Prospects Are Based 
In preparing our outlook and prospects, we have taken into account all events known to us at the time 
we prepared this report that could influence SAP’s business going forward."

"The new compensation system is effective from 2024 and will therefore form the 
basis of the 2024 compensation report."
"For more information, please see the 2024 compensation 
system for Executive Board members."
"Compensation for Executive Board Members 
Compensation System 
The compensation for Executive Board members is intended to reflect the demanding role of 
Executive Board members leading a global company in a rapidly evolving sector."
"The compensation 
level is aimed to be competitive to support SAP in the global market for highly skilled executives, 
especially in the context of the international software industry."
"It is our goal that our Executive Board 
compensation provides sustainable incentive for committed, successful work in a dynamic business 
environment."
"In this context, the compensation is 
compared with the pay of SAP executives and non-executive SAP employees to ensure that the 
principle of proportionality is observed within SAP."
"The compensation system is, to a major extent, already aligned with the compensation agreements 
currently in place, with the exception of a few provisions relating to fringe benefits and/or pension 
commitments."
"When, in future, new members are appointed or members are reappointed, the 
Supervisory Board will ensure that the specific total compensation is aligned with the compensation 
system."
"For more information about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees, see Item 10."
"These KPIs and their target values as well as their weighting are set by the 
Supervisory Board each year and are aligned to the SAP budget for that year or to SAP’s externally 
communicated financial ambitions."
"The Supervisory Board sets the individual total target compensation for each Executive Board 
member, comprised of the fixed compensation element and the two performance-based elements."
"This target compensation is benchmarked based on SAP’s global strategy, market position, business 
performance and future prospects of economy, and the compensation paid at comparable national 
and international companies."
"The benchmarking was conducted in January 2023 based on the 
compensation data from the DAX 40 companies as well as selected U.S.-based IT and other 
technology companies.62 This benchmark was the basis for all compensation decisions made for 2023 
and led to no changes."
"The Supervisory Board reviews, assesses, and sets the target compensation in 
its first meeting of each fiscal year (February 22, 2023, for 2023)."
"The Supervisory Board is of the 
opinion that this approach ensures that the compensation is appropriate."
The compensation system is designed to support long-term growth in the Company’s value.
"The long-
term incentive element therefore has significant weighting, making up about two-thirds of the CEO’s 
compensation target, and more than 50% of the ordinary Executive Board members’ compensation 
target."
"In the case of any extraordinary, unforeseeable events, the Supervisory Board is entitled, at its 
reasonable discretion, to adjust the performance-based compensation before payout upwards or 
downwards in the interest of SAP."
"This discretion is limited to +/−20% for the STI and to +/−10% for the 
LTI."
The individual elements of SAP’s Executive Board compensation are described in more detail below.
"Non-Performance-Based Compensation 
Fixed Compensation 
The fixed compensation is paid monthly in 12 equal installments in the Executive Board member’s 
home currency."
"Home currency is the currency of the Executive Board member’s primary place of 
residence."
"Fringe Benefits 
The contractually guaranteed fringe benefits mainly comprise insurance contributions, benefits in kind,

"In case of a relocation to Germany from abroad, a relocation package of up to 15% of fixed 
compensation for ordinary Executive Board members and up to 30% for the CEO can be granted."
"Additionally, to the extent that compensation benefit earned prior to moving to the SAP Executive 
Board is lost due to this move, a one-off payment (replacement award) could be granted in an amount 
of up to 200% of the fixed compensation."
"Retirement Pension 
The retirement pension plan that applies at SAP is based on defined contributions."
"For Executive 
Board members whose permanent place of residence is outside Germany, SAP may specify a 
retirement pension plan that applies for employees at a company belonging to the SAP Group in the 
relevant country, limited to 30% of fixed compensation."
"According to the new compensation system 
approved on May 11, 2023, the pension-related commitments could also apply retroactively for the 
period from January 1, 2023."
"Performance-Based Compensation 
Short-Term Incentive 
 
1 Based on non-IFRS metrics published in October 2023 reflecting the decision of the Supervisory Board in September 2023 (for more 
information, see the section Decisions for 2023)."
"The short-term, one-year performance-based compensation (Short-Term Incentive, STI) is determined 
based on a set of financial targets (financial KPIs) and sustainability targets (sustainability KPIs)."
"The sustainability KPIs have a total weighting of 20%, and comprise Customer Net Promoter Score, 
which measures SAP’s customer loyalty; Employee Engagement Index, which measures SAP’s 
employee commitment, pride, and loyalty; and Carbon Impact, which measures SAP’s greenhouse gas 
emissions."
The KPIs and their respective target values are derived from SAP’s budget for the respective year.
"For 
more information about KPIs, see the Performance Management System section in the SAP Integrated 
Report 2023."
"Each underlying KPI includes a hurdle and a cap in addition to the overall hurdle of 50% and the 
overall cap of 140%."
"In the event that the hurdle for the individual KPIs is missed and results in the 
weighted target achievement also falling below the overall hurdle of 50%, the individual hurdle for the 
respective KPI will be ignored."
"If the weighted target achievement is below 50%, there is no STI payout."
"In this case, the target achievement for these KPIs is set to zero."
"The STI compensation will be paid out after the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in the 
following year."
It is paid in the Executive Board member’s home currency.
"All Executive Board members 
are obliged to purchase SAP shares worth at least 5% of the actual payout amount in accordance with 
appropriate trading period regulations."
These shares are subject to a three-year holding period.
"Long-Term Incentive 
The SAP Long-Term Incentive Program 2020 (LTI 2020) is granted in annual tranches and reflects SAP’s 
long-term strategy and thus sets uniform incentives for the Executive Board members to achieve key 
targets from the long-term strategic plans."
"The LTI 2020 also serves to reward the Executive Board 
members for long-term SAP share price performance as compared to the market, thus ensuring that 
shareholders' interests are also honored."
"In addition, the LTI 2020 includes a component designed to 
ensure long-term retention of our Executive Board members."
"The LTI 2020 is a virtual share program under which annual tranches with a term of approximately four 
years each are granted."
"When the individual tranches are granted, a certain grant amount specified in 
the Executive Board member's service contract is converted into virtual shares (Share Units) in each 
case."
"The grant amount cannot exceed 700% of the fixed compensation (based on the relevant euro 
amounts when determining the specific compensation)."
"The grant amount is divided by the SAP share 
price, which corresponds to the arithmetic mean on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of 
the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole (grant price)."
"In 2023, the financial 
results were published on January 26, 2023."
"The Share Units allocated are composed of 1/3 financial 
performance share units (FSUs), 1/3 market performance share units (MSUs), and 1/3 retention share 
units (RSUs)."
All three types of Share Unit have a vesting period of approximately four years.
"The targets for each 
tranche are based on the cumulative three-year sum of each KPI."
"Cloud revenue and total revenue 
have a cap of 110% and a hurdle of 90% target achievement, while operating income has a cap of 
120% and a hurdle of 80% target achievement."
"The performance factor 
depends on the amount of the total shareholder return (TSR) on the SAP share, measured for an entire 
performance period of approximately three years, and ranked in relation to the TSR performance of 
the companies of the NASDAQ-100 Index (Index)."
"TSR reflects the performance of the share, 
combining share price development and granted and reinvested dividends."
"The market performance 
factor has a cap at 150% at the 75th percentile (P-75) and a hurdle of 50% at 25th percentile (P-25); 
below the hurdle, no MSUs are considered."
"Performance factor is only higher
than 100% when SAP TSR performance is
positive."
"The performance of the Share Units is linked to 
the performance of the SAP share price, including dividend payments."
"The arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 
20 trading days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the 
year as a whole will be used as the payout price."
"The payout amount per Share Unit, including the dividend amounts due on the Share Units, is capped 
at 200% of the grant price."
"Due to the potential change in the number of FSUs and MSUs, the 
maximum possible payout amount under any of the annual tranches of the LTI 2020 is thus 
approximately 267% of the grant amount."
"Currency exchange rate risks are borne by the Executive 
Board members."
"However, all types of Share Unit may expire during the entire term of a tranche under certain 
conditions."
"In case Share Units are forfeited in part, the percentage of the 
forfeiture is proportional to the four-year vesting period of each grant."
"This means that 25% of the grant 
is earned each year of the vesting period."
Unearned grants are forfeited.
"LTI Forfeiture Rules (including example calculation1)

performance condition); Executive Board member’s contract terminates after year four (December 31, 2026)."
2 As defined in the individual Executive Board members’ contracts.
"3 For the definition, see the Early End-of-Service Undertakings section."
"The euro 
cap for a full financial year equals 120% each for the sum of the fixed compensation and STI target 
amount converted into euro plus 20% of the grant amount for a tranche under the LTI 2020."
"The maximum compensation (not considering any fringe benefits, replacement 
awards, retirement pension, and foreign currency exchange rate cap) is €13.2 million for ordinary 
Executive Board members and €29.8 million for the CEO."
"The maximum total compensation including 
all maximum possible benefits is €15.0 million for ordinary Executive Board members and €34.5 million 
for the CEO."
"To illustrate the maximum total compensation including all maximum benefits, the LTI is allocated as 
high as the defined ranges allow, and the fixed compensation is allocated as low as the defined ranges 
allow."
"For this purpose, the recurring benefits include retirement pension, foreign currency exchange 
rate cap, and fringe benefits."
"In addition, based on the new compensation system, the limit of Julia 
White’s and Scott Russell’s fringe benefits determined for 2024 apply retroactively for 2023."
"In such case, the 
Executive Board member is obliged to repay to SAP the amount by which the payment actually made 
exceeds the payment amount due on the basis of the targets actually achieved."
"In addition, in compliance with new requirements by the U.S."
"Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the New York Stock Exchange for companies listed in the United States, including foreign private 
issuers such as SAP, SAP adopted a clawback policy that is applicable as of October 2, 2023."
"federal securities laws 
that impacts the calculation of incentive-based compensation paid out in the last three years."
"Offsetting Compensation in Case of Roles Assumed Inside and Outside the Group 
At the request of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board member will assume roles on the 
supervisory board or similar bodies at affiliates of SAP without receiving separate compensation."
"If, in 
exceptional cases, it is impossible to rule out compensation for a role assumed within the Group, it will 
be offset against the other compensation due to the Executive Board member."
"The Supervisory Board 
has to agree before an Executive Board member assumes any roles on supervisory boards or similar 
bodies at companies outside the Group and will decide in the individual case whether and to what 
extent any compensation is to be offset against compensation paid by SAP."
"Decisions for 2023 
No corrections were made to the payout amounts for the STI 2022 or LTI 2016 Plan tranche 2019 paid 
in May 2023."
"The Supervisory Board did not request that any Executive Board member return 
payments (clawback provision)."
"On February 21, 2024, the Supervisory Board assessed SAP’s 
performance against the previously agreed targets and determined the amount of the STI 2023 for the 
entire Executive Board."
"On July 27, 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to exclude the impact of the Qualtrics divestiture and 
resolved updated targets for the STI 2023 and the LTI tranches 2021, 2022, and 2023."
"Furthermore, in September 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to exclude the expenses related to 
compliance matters from the variable Executive Board compensation for 2023 and 2024."
"This applies 
for the Executive Board members’ compensation components STI and LTI as far as the KPIs “Operating 
Margin Increase” (STI) and “Operating Income” (LTI) for the fiscal years 2023 and 2024 are concerned."
"This decision also affects the 2021 and 2022 tranches of the LTI 2020 (LTI 2021, LTI 2022, LTI 2023, 
LTI 2024) and the STI for the years 2023 and 2024 (STI 2023 and STI 2024)."
"The Supervisory Board 
recognizes the fact that the compliance matters in question stem almost exclusively from events in the 
past when none of the current Executive Board members were in office."
"At the same time, it ensures 
that this temporary adjustment will safeguard the business performance focus of the compensation for 
the current Executive Board members."
"In addition, the current Executive Board has significantly 
improved, expanded, and made the Company’s compliance efforts much more effective to prevent 
comparable cases from occurring again in the future."
"In accordance with the new compensation system effective 2024, the Supervisory Board resolved 
already on October 26, 2023, to set the cap on fringe benefits for Scott Russell at US$456,000 and for 
Julia White at US$363,000 for the year 2023."
"On December 21, 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to exclude the impact of the LeanIX 
acquisition and resolved to neutralize the effects on the STI 2023 and the LTI tranches for 2021, 2022, 
and 2023."

"Contractual Compensation 
The contractual compensation shows the target amounts agreed in the individual employment 
contracts, including fringe benefits, and corresponds to a target achievement of 100% for the 
respective periods."
"If the appointment term commences or ends during a financial year, the 
compensation is disclosed pro rata temporis."
"As the fixed compensation and the STI are determined in the Executive Board member’s home 
currency, a maximum euro equivalent (“euro cap”) is considered to limit the exchange rate fluctuations 
to 20% of the sum of contractual values for fixed compensation, STI, and LTI in euros."
"For conversion 
purposes from home currency into euro, for fixed compensation the average exchange rate and for the 
one-year variable compensation the year-end exchange rate of the respective period applies."

difference to the contractual exchange rate is disclosed."
"It is ensured that the potential payments, taking the STI and LTI caps into account, cannot exceed the 
maximum compensation and the maximum total compensation."
"Compensation Awarded and Due 
Compensation that has been received and/or earned in the reporting year is defined as compensation 
awarded and due based on section 162 of the AktG."

"A surviving dependent’s pension is paid on the death of a former 
member of the Executive Board, if covered."
"The disability pension is 100% of the vested retirement 
pension entitlement and is payable until the beneficiary’s 62nd birthday, after which it is replaced by 
a retirement pension."
"The surviving dependent’s pension is 60% of the retirement pension or 
vested disability pension entitlement at death."
Entitlements are enforceable against SAP SE.
"Current 
pension payments are reviewed annually for adjustments and, if applicable, increased according to 
the surplus in the pension liability insurance or by 1% annually, depending on the agreement."
"If 
service is ended before the retirement age of 62, pension entitlement is reduced in proportion as 
the actual length of service stands in relation to the maximum possible length of service."
"Alternatively, the entitlement to benefits corresponds to the pension contributions paid up to that 
point."
The applied retirement pension plan is contributory.
"The contribution is 4% of applicable 
compensation up to the applicable income threshold plus 14% of applicable compensation above 
the applicable income threshold."
"For this purpose, applicable compensation is 180% of annual 
base salary."
"The applicable income threshold is the statutory annual income threshold for the state 
pension plan in Germany (West), as amended from time to time."
– SAP made contributions to a third-party pension plan for Scott Russell and Julia White.
"SAP’s 
matching contributions are based on payments by Scott Russell and Julia White into their pension 
plan."
"During this non-compete period, Executive Board members receive abstention payments 
corresponding to 50% of their average contractual compensation as members."
"This average is 
calculated on the basis of the preceding three years."
"Any other occupational income generated by the 
Executive Board member is deducted from their compensation."
"In accordance with the German 
Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), the Supervisory Board will offset any severance payments 
against such compensation for abstention."
"The following table presents the theoretical amounts for the net present values of the postcontractual 
non-compete abstention payments."
"The calculation assumes the following: 
– The Executive Board member leaves SAP at the end of their respective current contract term."
"– Their final average contractual compensation prior to their departure equals their compensation in 
2023."
"Actual postcontractual non-compete payments will likely differ from these amounts depending on the 
time of departure and the compensation levels and target achievements at the time of departure."
"Starting in January 2024, she receives for a period of 12 months monthly 
abstention compensation for the postcontractual non-compete period totaling €2,452,967."
"In accordance with section G.13 of the GCGC, payments 
made to an Executive Board member due to early termination must not exceed twice the annual total 
compensation."
"The annual total compensation is defined as the individual total target compensation 
comprised of the fixed compensation element and the two performance-based elements."
"In the case 
of change of control, the payment must not exceed 150% of the severance payment cap."
"Members are 
not entitled to that severance payment if they have not served SAP as a member of the Executive 
Board for at least one year or if they leave SAP SE for reasons for which they are responsible."

"The compensation of Executive Board 
members is considered in accordance with section 162 of the AktG awarded and due."
"The presentation of average employee compensation is based on the average full-time equivalent 
number of employees in the respective year."
"Average employee compensation comprises the 
personnel expenses for salaries, fringe benefits, employer contributions to social insurance, and any 
short-term and long-term variable compensation components attributable to the fiscal year."
"Therefore, 
employee compensation is also equivalent to granted and due compensation within the meaning of 
section 162 of the AktG and thus in line with Executive Board and Supervisory Board compensation."
"By 
resolution of our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 11, 2023, the section was changed."
"It 
now provides for additional compensation for the newly established role of a Lead Independent 
Director."
"Each member of the Supervisory Board receives, in addition to the reimbursement of their expenses, 
an annual basic compensation of €165,000."
"The chairperson receives €275,000 and the deputy 
chairperson €220,000 annually."
"In addition, we reimburse members of the Supervisory Board for the 
value-added tax payable on their compensation."
"For membership of the Audit and Compliance Committee, Supervisory Board members receive an 
additional fixed annual compensation of €50,000, and for membership of any other Supervisory Board 
committee €35,000, provided that the committee concerned has met in the year."
"The chairperson of 
the Audit and Compliance Committee receives €95,000, and the chairpersons of the other committees 
receive €50,000."
"If a deputy chairperson is appointed for a committee, he or she receives €43,500 per 
year, and €72,500 per year for the Audit and Compliance Committee."

"If the Supervisory Board appoints a Lead Independent Director, the Lead Independent Director shall 
receive compensation of €50,000 per year in addition to his or her basic compensation and in addition 
to his or her compensation for any memberships in committees."
"Any members of the Supervisory Board who have served for less than the entire year receive one-
twelfth of the annual compensation for each month of service commenced."

The Executive Board members and the Supervisory Board of SAP SE are responsible for the 
preparation of the compensation report, including the related disclosures, in accordance with the 
requirements of Section 162 AktG."
"The Executive Board members and the Supervisory Board are also 
responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of 
the compensation report including the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error."
"Auditor's responsibilities 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this compensation report, including the related 
disclosures, based on our audit."
"We conducted our audit in accordance with the German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer 
[Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Those standards require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts, including the 
related disclosures, in the compensation report."
"The procedures selected depend on the auditor's 
professional judgement."
"This includes an assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, in the compensation report, including the related disclosures."
"In assessing these 
risks, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant for the preparation of the 
compensation report, including the related disclosures."
"The objective is to plan and perform audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control."
"An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made 
by Executive Board members and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the compensation report, including the related disclosures."
"We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion."
"Opinion 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the compensation report for the 
financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, including the related disclosures, complies in all 
material respects with the financial reporting requirements of Section 162 AktG."
"As we have issued an unqualified opinion on the 
substantive audit of the compensation report, this opinion includes the conclusion that the disclosures 
pursuant to Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG have been made, in all material respects, in the 
compensation report."
"It was explicitly agreed in the audit contract with the client that the inclusion of third parties in the 
scope of protection is not intended."
"Therefore, we do not assume any responsibility towards third 
parties."
"We define headcount in FTE64 as the number of people on permanent employment 
contracts, taking into account their staffing percentage."
"Students, individuals employed by SAP but 
currently not working for reasons such as maternity/parental leave, and temporary employees on 
limited contracts of less than six months are excluded from our figures."
"The number of temporary 
employees is not material."
"The personnel expense for each employee is defined as the overall personnel expense divided by the 
average number of employees."
"For 2024, we plan a targeted restructuring program in close alignment with social partners, which is 
expected to affect about 8,000 employees from SAP’s global workforce."

TRANSACTIONS 
Major Shareholders 
The share capital of SAP SE consists of ordinary shares, which are issued only in bearer form."
"Accordingly, SAP SE generally cannot determine the identity of its shareholders or how many shares a 
particular shareholder owns."
SAP’s ordinary shares are traded in the United States by means of ADRs.
Each ADR currently represents one SAP SE ordinary share.
"On February 9, 2024, based on information 
provided by the Depositary there were 64,676,139 ADRs held of record by 654 registered holders."
"The 
ordinary shares underlying such ADRs represented 5.26% of the then-outstanding ordinary shares 
(including treasury stock)."
"Because SAP’s ordinary shares are issued in bearer form only, we are unable 
to determine the number of ordinary shares directly held by persons with U.S."
"There was, as 
far as we are able to tell given the nature of our shares, no significant change in the percentage 
ownership held by any major shareholder during the past three years."
"None of the major shareholders 
have special voting rights."

Introduction 
SAP SE, as a European Company with a two-tier board system, is governed by three separate bodies: 
the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders."
"Their 
rules are defined by European and German law, by the Agreement on the Involvement of Employees in 
SAP SE (“Employee Involvement Agreement”, “EIA”), by the German Corporate Governance Code and 
by SAP’s Articles of Incorporation (Satzung) and are summarized below."
"Differences in 
Corporate Governance Practices” for additional information on our corporate governance practices."
"The Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board appoints and removes the members of the Executive Board and oversees and 
advises the management of the corporation."
"At regular intervals it meets to discuss current business as 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
139 
 
well as business development and planning."
"The SAP Executive Board must consult with the 
Supervisory Board concerning the corporate strategy, which is developed by the Executive Board."
"Types of transactions for which the Executive Board requires the Supervisory Board’s consent are 
listed in the Articles of Incorporation; in addition, the Supervisory Board has specified further types of 
transactions that require its consent."
"Accordingly, the Supervisory Board must also approve the annual 
budget of SAP upon submission by the Executive Board and certain subsequent deviations from the 
approved budget."
"The Supervisory Board is also responsible for representing SAP SE in transactions 
between SAP SE and Executive Board members."
"The Supervisory Board, based on a recommendation by its Audit and Compliance Committee, 
provides its proposal for the election of the external independent auditor to the Annual General 
Meeting of Shareholders."
"The 
Supervisory Board is also responsible for monitoring the auditor’s independence and the audit quality, 
a task it has delegated to the Audit and Compliance Committee."
"Pursuant to Article 40 (3) sentence 1 of the SE Regulation, the number of members of the supervisory 
board and the rules for determining this number are to be laid down in the Articles of Incorporation."
"Furthermore, pursuant to Section 17 (1) SE-AG, the size of supervisory boards of companies which, like 
SAP SE, have a capital stock exceeding €10,000,000, is limited to twenty-one members."
"In line with 
these provisions as well as the EIA, the Articles of Incorporation of SAP SE provide that the 
Supervisory Board shall be composed of eighteen members."
"The SE Works Council represents the SAP employees in member states of the 
European Union and in the contract states of the European Economic Area."
"Pursuant to Section 17(2) 
SE-AG, the Supervisory Board of SAP SE must have a minimum of 30% men and 30% women."
"This 
quota for the Supervisory Board must be observed for any new appointment to the Supervisory 
Board."
"In 2023, there were four women on the shareholder representatives’ side of the Supervisory 
Board until May 2023 and three women on the shareholder representatives’ side of the Supervisory 
Board from May onwards."
"During all of 2023 there were five women on the employee representatives’ 
side."
"Thus, the percentage of women on the Supervisory Board exceeded the minimum quota of 30% 
throughout 2023."
"The procedure for the appointment of the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board of SAP 
SE is governed by the EIA."
"The eighth seat is allocated to the country represented in the SE Works Council with 
the highest number of SAP employees."
"The ninth seat is allocated to a country not already allocated a 
seat in the Supervisory Board but represented on the SE Works Council."
"In 2023 the first six seats were 
allocated to Germany, the seventh seat was allocated to the UK, the eighth seat was also allocated to 
Germany, and the ninth seat was allocated to a European country not represented by the first eight 
seats, as determined by the SE Works Council."
"The employees’ representatives for the first six seats 
allocated to Germany were determined by direct vote by all SAP employees with their principal place 
of employment in Germany."
"According to the EIA, the employees’ representative for the seventh seat 
allocated to the UK is generally determined according to the applicable provisions of the UK law on 
the election or appointment of employees’ representatives on a supervisory board."
"With regard to the 
eighth and ninth seats, members of the SE Works Council from Germany and Bulgaria were appointed 
by the SE Works Council as employees’ representatives."

Shareholders may be removed by three-quarters of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting of 
Shareholders."

members by a majority of the votes cast."
"Only a shareholders’ representative may be elected as 
chairperson of the Supervisory Board."
"When electing the chairperson of the Supervisory Board, the 
oldest member in terms of age of the shareholders’ representatives on the Supervisory Board will 
chair the meeting and, in the event of a tied vote, will have the casting vote."
"Unless otherwise mandatorily prescribed by law or the Articles of Incorporation, resolutions of the 
Supervisory Board are adopted by simple majority of the votes cast."
"In the event of a tie, the vote of 
the chairperson and, in the event that the chairperson does not participate in passing the resolution, 
the vote of the deputy chairperson, provided that he or she is a shareholders’ representative, will be 
decisive (casting vote)."
"In any event, the term of office shall end after six years at 
most."
"Our Supervisory Board holds four ordinary meetings per year and in 
addition convenes extraordinary meetings as needed or resolves by way of circular resolution."
"The 
compensation of the members of the Supervisory Board is set in the Articles of Incorporation."
"All of the shareholder representatives are considered independent from SAP and the Supervisory 
Board."
"This is in compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), which stipulates 
that an adequate number of the shareholder representatives on our Supervisory Board be 
independent."
"To be considered for appointment to the Supervisory Board and for as long as they 
serve, members must comply with certain criteria concerning independence, conflicts of interest and 
multiple memberships of management, and supervisory and other governing bodies."
"They must be 
loyal to SAP in their conduct and must not accept any position in companies that are in competition 
with SAP."

by the Supervisory Board concerning the members of the Executive Board, e.g."
"appointment and 
remuneration, as well as conclusion of, amendments to, and termination of Executive Board members’ 
service contracts and succession planning."
"The Committee also handles all matters related to 
corporate governance."
"The German Stock Corporation Act prohibits the Personnel and Governance Committee from deciding 
on the compensation of the Executive Board members on behalf of the Supervisory Board and 
requires that such decision is made by the entire Supervisory Board."

General Meeting of Shareholders with the right to vote on the system for the compensation of

"Under German law SAP SE’s Supervisory Board members and Executive Board members have a duty 
of loyalty and care towards SAP SE."
"They must exercise the standard of care of a prudent and diligent 
businessman and bear the burden of proving they did so if their actions are contested."
"Both bodies 
must consider the interest of SAP SE shareholders and our employees and, to some extent, the 
common good."
"Those who violate their duties may be held jointly and severally liable for any resulting 
damages, unless they acted pursuant to a lawful resolution of the Annual General Meeting of 
Shareholders."
"SAP has a Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct for Employees (CoEBC) that is applicable to 
all employees, managers, the members of SAP’s Executive Board, as well as employee 
representatives of the Supervisory Board (see “Item 16B."
Code of Ethics” for details).
"Under German law the Executive Board of SAP SE is required to assess and manage all major risks for 
the SAP Group."
"In addition, all measures taken by management to reduce and handle the risks have to 
be documented."
"Therefore, SAP’s Executive Board has adopted suitable measures such as 
implementing an enterprise-wide risk monitoring system to ensure that adverse developments 
endangering the corporate standing are recognized at a reasonably early point in time."
"The Office of Ethics and Compliance was created by the SAP Executive Board in 2006 to oversee and 
coordinate legal and regulatory policy compliance at SAP."
"The Group Chief Compliance Officer 
heading the Office of Ethics and Compliance reports directly to CEO Christian Klein and also has direct 
communication channels and reporting obligations to the Audit and Compliance Committee of the 
Supervisory Board."
"The Office of Ethics and Compliance manages a network of field compliance 
officers based across the globe who act as the first point of contact for the business regarding 
compliance matters."
"The Office of Ethics and Compliance provides training and communication to SAP 
employees to raise awareness and understanding of legal and regulatory compliance policies."
"Speak 
Out at SAP is SAP’s independently managed whistleblower reporting tool, through which any matters 
or concerns can be reported easily, and, if desired, anonymously."
"The tool is available twenty four 
hours a day, seven days a week, both internally to SAP employees and externally to concerned parties, 
including customers, suppliers, and partners."
"Beyond Speak Out at SAP, we provide further reporting 
channels, including an internal ticketing system, a postal address for written submissions, as well as 
local contact persons worldwide."
"Employee help lines are also supported in each region where 
questions can be raised or questionable conduct can be reported without fear of retaliation."

Shareholders of the Company exercise their voting rights at shareholders’ meetings."

Board calls the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, which must take place within the first six 
months of each fiscal year."
"The Supervisory Board or the Executive Board may call an extraordinary 
meeting of the shareholders if the interests of the stock corporation so require."
"Additionally, 
shareholders of SAP SE holding in the aggregate a minimum of 5% of SAP SE’s issued share capital 
may call an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders."
"Shareholders as of the record date are entitled 
to attend and participate in shareholders’ meetings if they have provided timely notice of their 
intention to attend the meeting."
"Shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board are generally 
elected at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for a term not longer than six years."
"Shareholders may also be asked to grant authorization to repurchase treasury shares, to resolve on 
measures to raise or reduce the capital of the Company or to ratify amendments of our Articles of 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
144 
 
Incorporation."
"The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders can make management decisions only if 
requested to do so by the Executive Board."
"The offer statement must be published upon 
approval by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority or expiry of a certain time period without such 
publication being prohibited by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority."
"Once a shareholder has 
acquired shares representing at least 30% of the voting rights in an EEA-listed company, it must make 
an offer for all remaining shares."
"The Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act requires the executive 
board of the target company to refrain from taking any measures that may frustrate the success of the 
takeover offer."
"However, the target executive board is permitted to take any action that a prudent and 
diligent management of a company that is not the target of a takeover bid would also take."
"Moreover, 
the target executive board may search for other bidders and, with the prior approval of the supervisory 
board, may take other defensive measures, provided that both boards act within the parameters of 
their general authority under the German Stock Corporation Act."
"Under the European Takeover Directive of 2004 member states had to choose whether EU restrictions 
on defensive measures apply to companies that are registered in their territory."
"Germany decided to 
opt out and to retain its current restrictions on a board implementing defensive measures (as 
described above)."
"As required by the European Takeover Directive if a country decides to opt out the 
German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act grants companies the option of voluntarily applying 
the European standard by a change of the Articles of Incorporation (opt-in)."
"SAP SE has not made use 
of this option."
"Change in Share Capital 
Under German law, the capital stock may be increased in consideration of contributions in cash or in 
kind, or by establishing authorized capital or contingent capital or by an increase of the company’s 
capital reserves."
"Authorized capital provides the Executive Board with the flexibility to issue new 
shares for a period of up to five years."
"The Executive Board must obtain the approval of the 
Supervisory Board before issuing new shares with regard to the authorized capital."
"Contingent capital 
allows the issuance of new shares for specified purposes, including stock option plans for Executive 
Board members or employees and the issuance of shares upon conversion of convertible bonds and 
exercise of stock options."
"By law, the Executive Board may only issue new shares with regard to the 
contingent capital for the specified purposes."
"Capital increases require an approval by at least 75% of 
the valid votes cast at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in which the increase is proposed 
and require an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation."

In 2002 our Audit and Compliance Committee adopted a policy with regard to the pre-approval of 
audit and non-audit services to be provided by our external independent auditors."
"This policy, which is 
designed to assure that such engagements do not impair the independence of our auditors, was 
amended several times since 2002 with the latest changes made to reflect the provisions on audit and 
non-audit services introduced by European Union in 2014."
"The policy requires prior approval of the 
Audit and Compliance Committee for all services to be provided by our external independent auditors 
for any entity of the SAP Group."
"With regard to non-audit services the policy distinguishes among three 
categories of services:  
– “Prohibited services:” This category includes services that our external independent auditors must 
not be engaged to perform."
"These are services that are not permitted by applicable law or that 
would be inconsistent with maintaining the auditors’ independence."
"– “Services requiring universal approval:” Services of this category may be provided by our external 
independent auditors up to a certain aggregate amount in fees per year that is determined by the 
Audit and Compliance Committee."
"Our Chief Accounting Officer or individuals empowered by him review all individual requests to engage 
our external independent auditors as a service provider in accordance with this policy and determines 
the category to which the requested service belongs."

over a specified limit are additionally reviewed by our CFO."

who is elected to the supervisory board or audit committee of that issuer pursuant to the issuer’s 
governing law."
"In this case, the employee is exempt from the independence requirements of Rule 10A-
3 and is permitted to sit on the audit committee."
We rely on this exemption.
"Our Audit and Compliance Committee includes four employee 
representatives, Manuela Asche-Holstein, Margret Klein-Magar, Peter Lengler, and James Wright, who 
were appointed to our Supervisory Board pursuant to the Agreement on the Involvement of 
Employees in SAP SE (see “Item 6."
"Directors, Senior Management and Employees.” for details)."
"We 
believe that our reliance on this exemption does not materially adversely affect the ability of our Audit 
and Compliance Committee to act independently and to satisfy the other requirements of Rule 10A-3."

"DIFFERENCES IN 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
PRACTICES 
The following summarizes the principal ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from 
the NYSE corporate governance rules applicable to U.S."
domestic issuers (the NYSE Rules).
"Introduction 
SAP is incorporated under the laws of the European Union and Germany, with securities publicly 
traded on markets in Germany, including the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and in the United States on the 
NYSE."
"The NYSE Rules permit foreign private issuers to follow applicable home country corporate 
governance practices in lieu of the NYSE corporate governance standards, subject to certain 
exceptions."
"Foreign private issuers electing to follow home country corporate governance rules are 
required to disclose the principal differences in their corporate governance practices from those 
required under the NYSE Rules."
"This Item 16G summarizes the principal ways in which SAP’s corporate 
governance practices differ from the NYSE Rules applicable to domestic issuers."
"Legal Framework 
The primary sources of law relating to the corporate governance of a European Company are the 
Council Regulation (EC) No."
"2157/2001 on the Statute for a European Company (the “SE Regulation”), 
the German Act on the Implementation of Council Regulation No."
"2157/2001 of October 8, 2001 on the 
Statute for a European Company (Gesetz zur Ausführung der Verordnung (EG) Nr."
"2157/2001 des 
Rates vom 8."
"Oktober 2001 über das Statut der Europäischen Gesellschaft (SE) – SE-
Ausführungsgesetz; “SE-AG”) of December 22, 2004, and the German Stock Corporation Act 
(Aktiengesetz)."
"In addition to these mandatory rules, the GCGC summarizes the mandatory 
statutory corporate governance principles found in the German Stock Corporation Act and other 
provisions of German law."
"Further, the GCGC contains supplemental recommendations and 
suggestions for standards on responsible corporate governance intended to reflect generally 
accepted best practices."
"SAP disclosed and reasoned deviations from a few of the GCGC 
recommendations in its Declaration of Compliance on a yearly basis from 2003 onwards."
"In its most 
recent Declaration of Compliance issued in October 2023, SAP declared that it has complied with all 
recommendations set out in the GCGC since the last declaration with the below exceptions."
"In the 
future, SAP will comply with the recommendations set out in the Code with the following exceptions:  
Subsequent change to the target values for the Executive Board`s variable compensation (Deviation 
from recommendation G.8 GCGC)."
"Department of Justice, the U.S."
"Securities and Exchange Commission, and other authorities in various 
countries, from the variable Executive Board compensation for the fiscal years 2023 and 2024."
"To this 
end, it decided to apply the non-IFRS definition used for SAP`s external reporting, pursuant to which 
expenses associated with regulatory compliance matters are eliminated, to Executive Board 
compensation for this period."
"Specifically, this concerns the calculation of target value achievement for 
the performance criteria “operating margin growth” and “operating profit” of the short-term and long-
term variable compensation (STI and LTI)."
"This temporary adjustment will safeguard the business 
performance focus of the compensation for the Executive Board members in office."
"At the same time, 
it will ensure that their current compensation is not affected by conduct that took place in prior 
performance periods."
"This recognizes the fact that the compliance matters in question stem almost 
exclusively from events in the past when none of the current Executive Board members were in office."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board believes that the current Executive Board has significantly 
improved, expanded, and made the Company`s compliance efforts much more effective to prevent 
comparable cases from occurring again in the future."
"Lastly, the adjustment will uphold the equal 
treatment of Executive Board members and employees regarding their compensation parameters."
"Disbursement of remaining variable remuneration components if an Executive Board member`s 
service contract is terminated (precautionary declaration of non-conformity with recommendation 
G.12 GCGC)."
"The disbursement will be made pro rata temporis in the 
proportion which the actual term that was shortened due to the change of control bears to the four-
year-term of a tranche plus 50% of the portion which should be forfeited if pro rata temporis aspects 
alone were considered."
"In view of the above, SAP declares, by way of precaution, non-conformity with 
the recommendation set out in section G.12 GCGC."
"In addition, SAP is 
convinced that the intended linkage of the remuneration to sustainable and long-term development is 
not lost due to this provision since the Executive Board members, during their term of service, cannot 
expect a change of control to later occur."
Declarations from 2018 to 2023 are available on the SAP website.
"Significant Differences 
We believe the following to be the significant differences between applicable European and German 
corporate governance practices, as SAP has implemented them, and those applicable to domestic 
companies under the NYSE Rules."
"The rules applicable to these governing bodies 
are defined by European and German law and by SAP’s Articles of Incorporation."
"This corporate 
structure differs from the unitary board of directors established by the relevant laws of all U.S."
"states 
and the NYSE Rules."
"Under the SE Regulation and the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory 
Board and Executive Board are separate and no individual may be a member of both boards."
"Additional Information — Corporate Governance” for additional information on the corporate 
structure."
"With respect to the audit committee, SAP is required to satisfy Rule 10A-
3 of the Exchange Act, which provides certain exemptions from the audit committee independence 
requirements in the case of employee board representatives."
"The NYSE Rules stipulate that no 
director qualifies as “independent” unless the board of directors has made an affirmative 
determination that the director has no material direct or indirect relationship with the listed company."
"However, under the NYSE Rules a director may still be deemed independent even if the director or a 
member of a director’s immediate family has received during a 12-month period within the prior three 
years up to $120,000 in direct compensation."
"In addition, a director may also be deemed independent 
even if a member of the director’s immediate family works for the company’s auditor in a non-partner 
capacity and not on the company’s audit."
"By contrast, the German Stock Corporation Act and the GCGC require that the Supervisory Board 
ensure that its members collectively have the knowledge, competencies and professional experience 
required to properly perform their duties."
"Additionally, the GCGC recommends that the Supervisory 
Board must have an appropriate number of independent shareholder representative members, as 
determined by those members, that also reflects the shareholder structure (C.6 GCGC), and determine 
annually whether such numbers have been met."
"More than half of the shareholder representatives 
must be independent from the company and from the Executive Board (C.7 GCGC)."
"According to this 
definition, a Supervisory Board member is considered independent if he or she is independent from 
the company and the Executive Board, and independent from any controlling shareholder (C.6 GCGC)."
"In the absence of a controlling shareholder at SAP, this last proviso does not apply."
"Supervisory Board 
members are considered independent from the company and the Executive Board if they have no 
personal or business relationship with the company or the Executive Board that may cause a 
substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest (C.7 GCGC)."
"Independence is assessed 
against a set of indicators (C.7 GCGC)."
"According to section C.10 GCGC, the chairpersons of 
the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee, and the committee that addresses Executive Board 
compensation should be independent from the company and the Executive Board."
"The members of 
the Supervisory Board must ensure that they have enough time to perform their board duties and 
must carry out their duties carefully and in the company’s best interests."
"They must be loyal to SAP in 
their conduct, and the GCGC recommends that they should not accept appointment to governing 
bodies of, or exercise advisory functions at, companies that are in significant competition with SAP."
"Supervisory Board members must disclose any planned conclusion of 
advisory or other service agreements or contracts for work with SAP, or loan agreements between 
them or persons closely related to them and SAP to the Supervisory Board promptly."
"Such 
agreements require the consent of the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board may grant its 
permission for any such transaction only if it is based on terms and conditions that are standard for the 
type of transaction in question and if the transaction is not contrary to SAP’s interest."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
163 
 
SAP complies with the director independence requirements and recommendations described above."
"In this context, the shareholder representatives determined that five (and thus more than half their 
total number) constitutes an appropriate number of independent shareholder representative 
members."
"Consequently, they determined that, when also considering the company`s shareholder 
structure, the Supervisory Board has an appropriate number of independent members in the meaning 
of section C.6 of the Code."
"Principle 15 of the GCGC states that at least one member of the Audit Committee must have expertise 
in the field of accounting and at least one other member of the Audit Committee must have expertise 
in the field of auditing."
"Accounting and auditing also 
include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance."
"Section D.3 of the GCGC recommends that 
the chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board should have appropriate expertise in 
at least one of the two areas."
"Section C.10 of the GCGC recommends that the chairperson of the Audit 
Committee should be independent from the company and the Executive Board as well as from the 
controlling shareholder."
"Furthermore, the chairperson of the Audit Committee should not 
simultaneously chair the Supervisory Board as a whole."
"Jennifer Xin-Zhe Li who is the current 
Chairperson of the Audit and Compliance Committee and Dr. Gunnar Wiedenfels as another member 
of the Audit and Compliance Committee meet these recommendations."
"However, applicable 
European and German corporate law does not require the Supervisory Board to make an affirmative 
determination for each individual member that it is independent or that a majority of Supervisory 
Board members or the members of a specific committee are independent."
"As described above, the 
GCGC only recommends that the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board determine 
whether they are independent in the meaning of and in compliance with the Code."
"The NYSE independence requirements are closely linked with risks specific to unitary boards of 
directors that are customary for U.S."
"In contrast, the two-tier board structure requires a 
strict separation of the executive board and supervisory board."
"The terms of employee 
participation with regard to the Supervisory Board of SAP SE are, among others, set out in the 
Agreement on the Involvement of Employees in SAP SE."
"As a result, the Supervisory Board of SAP SE 
consists of 18 members, of which nine are representatives of SAP SE’s shareholders elected at the 
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and nine members are representatives of the European 
employees."
"Only a shareholders’ representative may be elected as chairperson of the Supervisory 
Board."
"In case of a tied vote, the vote of the chairperson and, in the event that the chairperson does 
not participate in passing the resolution, the vote of the deputy chairperson, provided that he or she is 
a shareholders’ representative, will be decisive (casting vote)."
"This board structure creates a different 
system of checks and balances, including employee participation, and cannot be directly compared 
with a unitary board system."
"Audit Committee Independence 
As a foreign private issuer, the NYSE Rules require SAP to establish an Audit Committee that satisfies 
the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act with respect to audit committee independence."
SAP is in compliance with these requirements.
"The Chairperson of SAP’s Audit and Compliance 
Committee (Jennifer Xin-Zhe Li), Dr. Gunnar Wiedenfels, Dr. Friederike Rotsch and Gerhard Oswald 
meet the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act."
"The Audit Committee independence requirements are similar to the Board independence 
recommendations of the GCGC."
"See the section above under “Director Independence Rules.” 
Nonetheless, SAP meets the NYSE Rules on audit committee independence applicable to foreign 
private issuers."
"Rules on Non-Management Board Meetings are Different 
Section 303 A.03 of the NYSE Rules stipulates that the non-management board of each listed issuer 
must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without the management."
"Under applicable 
European and German corporate law and the GCGC the Supervisory Board is entitled but not 
required to exclude Executive Board members from its meetings."
"The Supervisory Board exercises this 
right generally during its meetings."
"However, the Executive Board members should not attend 
Supervisory Board and its committees’ meetings at which the statutory auditor is called in as an expert."
"An exception can be made in the event that participation of the Executive Board is deemed necessary 
by the Supervisory Board or the relevant committee."
"In addition, each committee’s performance must be reviewed annually."
"Applicable 
European and German corporate law does not mandate the creation of specific supervisory board 
committees."
"The GCGC recommends that the Supervisory Board establishes a Nomination 
Committee; according to Principle 14 of the GCGC an Audit Committee is to be established."
"Additional 
Information — Corporate Governance” for more information)."
"Rules on Shareholders’ Compulsory Approval are Different 
Section 312 of the NYSE Rules requires U.S."
"Specific Principles of Corporate Governance 
Under the NYSE Rules Section 303A.09 listed companies must adopt and disclose corporate 
guidelines."
"Since October 2007, SAP has applied, with few exceptions, and currently with only two 
exceptions, recommended corporate governance standards of the GCGC rather than company-
specific principles of corporate governance."
"The GCGC recommendations differ from the NYSE 
Standards primarily as outlined in this Item 16G."
"Although not required under applicable European and German 
law, SAP has a Code of Business Conduct that applies to all employees, managers, the members of 
SAP’s Executive Board, as well as employee representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"In 2021, we 
amended the Code of Business Conduct and created a single global policy, the Global Code of Ethics 
and Business Conduct for Employees, or the CoEBC."
"The CoEBC, together with local language versions 
and appendices relevant for specific countries, was rolled out in early 2022."
"SAP complies with the 
requirement to disclose the Code of Business Conduct and any waivers of the code with respect to 
directors and executive officers."

"CYBERSECURITY 
Risk Management and Strategy 
We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect 
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems, information, and our customers’ 
data."
"We have a central software solution to store, maintain, and report 
enterprise risk-relevant information, including cybersecurity risks."
"Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a security software development program 
intended to reduce the introduction of risks into our software, a software vulnerability and patch 
management program, and cybersecurity incident detection, response, and recovery programs, among 
others."
"Our cybersecurity risk team is committed to integrating cybersecurity risks into our overall 
enterprise risk management system and processes."
"We design and assess our cybersecurity risk management and strategy based on industry standard 
processes, regulatory requirements, certifications, and attestations, including the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)."
"This does not imply that we meet 
specific technical standards, specifications, or requirements but that we use the NIST as a guide to 
advocate a risk-based approach to identify and assess cybersecurity risks relevant to our business."
"Cybersecurity risks are reported to the Executive Board through cumulative risk and incident reporting 
and security updates."
"The Supervisory Board’s Technology and Strategy Committee (TSC) and its Audit 
& Compliance Committee (ACC) are apprised of key cybersecurity risks."
"By bringing these risks to the 
attention of the Executive Board, the TSC, and the ACC as appropriate, SAP’s disclosure decision 
makers have an early and recurring opportunity to assess the materiality of these cybersecurity risks."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
168 
 
SAP internal and external experts are engaged to evaluate SAP’s risk identification, assessment, and 
monitoring systems and processes, including with respect to cybersecurity risks."
"For example, SAP 
engaged third party consultants to assist with its implementation of the NIST CSF, which included 
quarterly external risk assessments and the development of a NIST self-assessment process."
"The TSC 
and ACC periodically request an independent review of the quality of our cybersecurity risk monitoring 
systems."
"Additionally, our risk monitoring systems are regularly audited by our external auditors and are subject 
to internal audits, including our cybersecurity monitoring systems."
"We consider the results of external 
and internal audits of our risk detection and monitoring systems and implement modifications as 
necessary."
"Finally, SAP engages third party legal consultants as necessary to assist with the 
implementation of legal requirements and industry standards, and to identify process weaknesses and 
track improvements."
"In May 2020 we disclosed that some of our cloud products did not meet one or several of the 
contractually agreed or statutory IT security standards in place at the time."
"The affected products were 
limited to the acquired entity products SAP Success Factors, SAP Concur, SAP/Callidus Cloud 
Commissions, SAP/Callidus Cloud CPQ, as well as SAP C4C/Sales Cloud, SAP Cloud Platform and SAP 
Analytics Cloud (the Affected Cloud Products)."
"These findings were not identified in response to a 
security incident."
SAP completed the remediation of the identified areas in July 2020.
"In addition, SAP 
updated its security-related terms and conditions and informed and supported affected customers."
"We have not identified risks from existing and known cybersecurity threats that have materially 
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, 
results of operations, or financial condition."
"However, we are subject to certain risks that if realized and 
sufficiently severe, are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations, business strategy or 
financial condition."
"Before 2023, the ACC had full oversight responsibility for 
SAP’s cybersecurity risk management program."
"The ACC reviews the effectiveness of SAP’s system for monitoring corporate security, which includes 
cybersecurity."
"The ACC discusses at least quarterly and in addition as needed with the members of the 
Executive Board, as well as the Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the Chief Security Compliance & Risk 
Officer (CSCRO), the cybersecurity controls and other measures established by the Executive Board."
The ACC is focused on cybersecurity risk and incident management and mitigation.
"The TSC reviews and monitors the technical systems and processes intended to defend against 
cybersecurity attacks and improve the security of SAP’s infrastructure."
"The TSC discusses at least 
quarterly and in addition as needed with the members of the Executive Board as well as the CSO and 
the CSCRO the potential and actual, if any, product and operational impacts of known cybersecurity 
risks and incidents."
"The TSC is focused on mitigating the product and operational-related impacts, if 
any, of cybersecurity risks and incidents."
"In addition, the 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
169 
 
TSC and ACC often participate in meetings with the Executive Board or members thereof and security 
executives for the purpose of receiving information on and discussing SAP’s cybersecurity risks and 
risk management program."
"The TSC and ACC participate in key decisions on cybersecurity-related 
issues, including risk materiality assessments, incident response and the provision of any necessary 
related disclosures."
"In 
addition, the Executive Board supervises SAP’s internal cybersecurity personnel."
"Certain members of 
SAP’s Executive Board have engineering, computer science and data science backgrounds and 
degrees, and knowledge, skills, and hands on experience in cybersecurity risk and incident 
management."
"The SAP Security and Cloud Compliance Governance Model is designed to ensure executive 
engagement and facilitates shared responsibility in quarterly SAP Security Advisory Board and Security 
Council meetings and in periodic updates to the Executive Board."
"SAP Global Security & Cloud Compliance 
SGSC is co-led by SAP’s CSO and its CSCRO, both of whom report to the Chief Technology Officer 
(CTO) and Executive Board member."
"SGSC is responsible for areas such as product and application 
security, cyber defense, operational security risk management, security compliance, executive 
protection, physical security, as well as the Trust Office that supports customers and partners with 
security-related issues."
"In addition, the SGSC reports to the Executive Board, the TSC and/or 
ACC as necessary outside of the quarterly reporting cadence on any potentially material cybersecurity 
risks and incidents."
"Business Information Security Officers (BISO) 
Each of SAP’s product Lines of Business (LOB) has a BISO, who is a senior security leader assigned to 
manage the security strategy and operations of the LOB and coordinate with other BISOs through a 
BISO Council reporting to our CSO."
"These BISOs serve many important functions, including managing 
SAP’s risk within each LOB."
"It is the responsibility of each BISO to supervise and monitor the specific 
risks associated with their respective LOB."
"This facilitates the reporting of security threats to the 
Security & Risk Assurance (SRA) Team through the local unit risk coordinator."
"The SRA Team evaluates 
and measures the security risks using a cyber risk quantification tool."
"Once validated, these risks are 
recorded and included in the Global Enterprise risk register and subject to risk mitigation actions."
"In 
the event of an incident, the BISO helps manage the event and support the CSO, CSCRO and, 
ultimately, the Executive Board in their decision-making processes."
"BISOs are supported by local 
security resources to assist with implementing SAP’s security strategy and protections within the 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
170 
 
business and technology context best suited for the LOB in question."
"BISOs and SAP Legal coordinate 
on significant cybersecurity risks and incidents impacting their LOB."
"Global Risk & Assurance Services Organization 
SAP’s GR&AS organization, led by our Chief Risk Officer/Chief Audit Executive (CRO), provides 
quarterly updates to the ACC, the TSC, and the Executive Board on SAP’s risk management systems 
and risks meeting SAP’s internal risk threshold."
"The CRO reports to SAP’s Group CFO and is 
responsible for designing and implementing SAP’s risk management system, with oversight by the 
Executive Board."
"This group meets on both a quarterly and an ad hoc basis 
to review cybersecurity issues, including but not limited to actual and potential cybersecurity incidents, 
thwarted attempts, cyber-related risks, and internal investigations (collectively, cybersecurity events)."
"As part of its review and assessment, this group evaluates the implications, if any, of the cybersecurity 
events on SAP’s financial statements and related disclosures."
"Where appropriate, matters are 
escalated and discussed among SAP’s General Counsel, the Executive Board, the TSC and/or the ACC."
"Assessments ensue at this level with senior leaders from the Cybersecurity Control Team and 
cybersecurity consultants who provide the Executive Board, the TSC and/or the ACC with updates on 
an as-needed basis and in SAP Security briefings."
"SAP discusses any significant cybersecurity events, 
their impact on SAP's financial statements, and any related disclosures with its external auditors."
"Employee Cybersecurity Education, Training and Compliance 
SGSC provides annual, mandatory security training which includes education and training on key 
cybersecurity risks companies like SAP face, and SAP’s expectations of employees as part of its risk 
mitigation strategy."
"In addition to this regular education, the Executive Board, the TSC and the ACC 
receive training on cybersecurity topics from our CSO, CSCRO and internal security staff as part of the 
continuing education on cybersecurity topics that impact public companies."
"(iii) Executive Board Reporting of Cybersecurity Risks to the ACC and the TSC 
of the Supervisory Board  
The Executive Board regularly reports cybersecurity risks and incidents to the TSC and ACC, as 
outlined above, with a focus on significant risks and incidents."
"This reporting occurs through various 
processes with input from SGSC, GR&AS, SAP Legal, BISOs and internal and external cybersecurity 
and legal consultants."
"Additionally, the Executive Board often participates in meetings with the TSC 
and/or the ACC on cybersecurity-related issues, including risk materiality assessments, incident 
response, third party audit matters and the provision of any necessary related disclosures."
Since SAP is a reporting entity under both German and U.S.
"laws, SAP adheres to both the Ad Hoc 
reporting requirements of the European Market Abuse Regulation and the U.S."

has duly caused and authorized the undersigned to sign this report on its behalf."
"In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied."
"Basis for Opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management."
"Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on 
our audit."
"We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S."
"federal securities laws and the 
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB."
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
"Those standards require that 
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-2 
 
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks."
"Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the 
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements."
"Our audit also included evaluating 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements."
"We believe that our audit provides a 
reasonable basis for our opinion."
"For most of the Company’s cloud offerings, measured both in volume and 
number, the customer is entitled to continuously access and use one or more cloud solutions for a 
specified term, therefore cloud revenue is recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the 
term of access."
"However, some cloud business models are provisioned on a consumption basis where 
a customer commits to a fixed value of spend on cloud services throughout the contract term, but with 
the discretion to call off cloud services on an as needed basis."
"For those arrangements cloud revenue 
is recognized based on consumption as it best reflects the measure towards satisfaction of the 
performance obligation(s)."
We identified cloud revenue recognition of certain contracts as a critical audit matter.
"Auditing these elements involved especially challenging and complex auditor 
judgment due to the complex nature of certain of the Company’s customer contracts and extent of 
audit effort required to address these matters."
"Assessment of the Company’s uncertain tax treatments   
As discussed in note C.5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company disclosed contingent 
liabilities relating to tax uncertainties of EUR 1,815 million."
"The nature of these activities can 
result in uncertainties in the estimation of the related tax exposures."
"We identified the assessment of the Company’s tax provision related to uncertain tax positions, 
specifically from transfer pricing and intercompany transactions for the use of intellectual property, as 
a critical audit matter."
"Auditing these 
elements involved especially challenging and complex auditor judgment due to the nature and extent 
of audit effort required to address these matters, including involvement of personnel with specialized 
skills and knowledge."
"Measurement of unlisted equity securities  
As discussed in note F.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company holds unlisted equity 
securities held at fair value of EUR 4,811 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily relating to Sapphire 
Ventures investments."
"These investments in unlisted equity securities are classified as financial 
instruments at fair value through profit and loss requiring a recurring fair value measurement using 
significant unobservable inputs."
"Auditing these elements involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment 
due to the extent of specialized skills or knowledge needed."

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2023."
"In our 
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria."
"Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial 
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
included in the accompanying Item 15, Controls and Procedures."
"Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit."
"We are a public 
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with U.S."
"federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB."
"We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of 
the PCAOB."
"Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects."
"Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk."
"Our audit also included 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances."
"We believe that 
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion."
"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements."
"Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the 
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
Those adjustments were audited by other auditors.
"Basis for Opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management."
"Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits."

Cost Classification 
Cost of Cloud and Software 
Cost of cloud and software includes the costs incurred in providing the services and producing the 
goods that generate cloud and software revenue."
"For more information about the 
capitalization of costs from contracts with customers, see Note (A.3)."
"Updated Cost Allocation Policy 
Starting January 1, 2023, all activities related to changes in the code of SAP’s cloud and on-premise 
solutions are treated as development-related activities."
"Some of those activities, specifically code 
corrections, were previously considered as support-related activities."
"SAP believes that this update 
aligns SAP’s accounting policy with market standards and increases comparability to its peers."
Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the updated cost allocation policy.
"Cost of Services 
Cost of services includes the costs incurred in providing the services that generate service revenue."
"Consequently, this line item primarily includes employee expenses and related training, system and 
system administration costs, and costs for third-party resources."
"Research and Development 
Research and development includes the costs incurred by activities related to the development of 
cloud and software solutions including resource and hardware costs for the development systems."
"The same applies for all activities related to changes in the code of SAP’s cloud and software 
solutions."
"For more information about the recognition of internally generated intangible assets from 
development, see Note (D.3)."
Please also note the Updated Cost Allocation Policy above.
"For more information about the capitalization of costs 
from contracts with customers, see Note (A.3)."
"General and Administration 
General and administration includes the costs related to finance and administrative functions, human 
resources, and general management as long as they are not directly attributable to one of the other 
operating expense line items."
"We base our judgments, estimates, and assumptions on historical and forecast information, and on 
regional and industry economic conditions in which we or our customers operate."
"Changes to these 
conditions could adversely affect our estimates."
"Actual results could differ 
significantly from original estimates."
"We are currently assessing the impact on SAP, but do not expect material effects on our 
financial position or profit after tax."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-18 
 
Section A – Customers 
This section discusses disclosures related to contracts with our customers."
"These include but are not 
limited to explanations of how we recognize revenue, revenue disaggregation, and information about 
our trade receivables and customer-related obligations."
"Cloud and software revenue, as presented in our Consolidated Income Statements, is the sum of our 
cloud revenue, our software license revenue, and our software support revenue."
"Platform as a service (PaaS), that is, access to a cloud-based platform to develop, deploy, integrate, 
and manage applications."
"Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), that is, hosting and related application management services for 
software hosted by SAP or third parties engaged by SAP."
"Premium cloud support, that is, support beyond the regular support embedded in the underlying 
cloud subscription services."
"Software license 
revenue includes revenue from both the sale of our standard software products and customer-specific 
on-premise-software development agreements."
"Software support revenue represents fees earned from providing customers with standardized 
support services that comprise unspecified future software updates, upgrades, and enhancements as 
well as technical product support services for on-premise software products."
"Services revenue primarily represents fees earned from professional consulting services, premium 
support services, and training services."
"Identification of Contract 
We frequently enter into multiple contracts with the same customer."
"For accounting purposes, we treat 
these contracts as a single contract if they are entered into at or near the same time and are 
economically interrelated."
"We do not combine contracts with closing days more than three months 
apart because we do not consider them being entered into near the same time."
"New arrangements with existing customers can be either a new contract or the modification of prior 
contracts with the customer."
"In determining 
whether a change in transaction price represents a contract modification or a change in variable 
consideration, we examine whether the change in price results from changing the contract or from 
applying unchanged existing contract provisions."
"Identification of Performance Obligations 
Our customer contracts often include various products and services."
"Typically, the products and 
services outlined in the Classes of Revenue section qualify as separate performance obligations and 
the portion of the contractual fee allocated to them is recognized separately."
"Judgment is required, 
however, in determining whether a good or service is considered a separate performance obligation."
"For our professional services and implementation activities, judgment is required to evaluate whether 
such services significantly integrate, customize, or modify the on-premise software or cloud service to 
which they relate."
"In this context, we consider the nature of the services and their volume relative to 
the volume of the on-premise software or cloud service to which they relate."
"In general, the 
implementation services for our cloud services go beyond pure setup activities and qualify as 
separate performance obligations."
"Similarly, our on-premise implementation services and our custom 
development services typically qualify as separate performance obligations."
"Non-distinct goods and 
services are combined into one distinct bundle of goods and services (combined performance 
obligation)."
"When selling goods or services, we frequently grant customers options to acquire additional goods or 
services (for example, renewals of cloud or support arrangements, or additional volumes of purchased 
cloud solutions or software)."
"We apply judgment in determining whether such options provide a 
material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into that contract."
"In this judgment, we consider, for example, whether the options entitle the customer to a discount that 
exceeds the discount granted for the respective goods or services sold together with the option."
"Determination of Transaction Price 
We apply judgment in determining the amount to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for 
transferring promised goods or services to a customer."
"Generally, variable consideration is estimated 
based on the most likely amount and is included in the transaction price to the extent that the 
constraint does not apply."
"This includes estimates as to whether and to what extent subsequent 
concessions may be granted to customers and whether the customer is expected to pay the 
contractual fees."
"In this judgment, we consider our history with the respective customer or on a 
portfolio basis."
"The recognition constraint is applied to on-premise software transactions that include usage-based or 
sales-based contingent fees."
"In contrast, our typical cloud services do not provide the customer with a 
software license because the customer does not have the right to terminate the hosting contract and 
take possession of the software."
"Consequently, variable cloud fees are considered in the transaction 
price based on estimates, rather than being accounted for as usage-based or sales-based license 
royalties."
Only very rarely do our contracts include significant financing components.
"We do not account for 
financing components if the period between when SAP transfers the promised goods or services to 
the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services is one year or less."
"Allocation of Transaction Price 
We have established a hierarchy to identify the standalone selling prices (SSPs) that we use to allocate 
the transaction price of a customer contract to the performance obligations in the contract."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-20 
 
– Where standalone selling prices for an offering are observable and reasonably consistent across 
customers (that is, not highly variable), our SSP estimates are derived from our respective pricing 
history."
"Typically, our standardized support offerings and our professional service offerings follow 
this approach."
"– Where sales prices for an offering are not directly observable or highly variable across customers, 
we use estimation techniques."
"For renewable offerings with highly variable pricing across 
customers, these techniques consider the individual contract’s expected renewal price as far as this 
price is substantive."
"Typically, our cloud offerings follow this approach."
"For non-renewable offerings, 
these estimations follow a cost-plus-margin approach."
"– For offerings that lack renewals, have highly variable pricing, and lack substantial direct costs to 
estimate based on a cost-plus-margin approach, we allocate the transaction price by applying a 
residual approach."
"We use this technique in particular for our standard on-premise software 
offerings."
Judgment is required when estimating SSPs.
"To judge whether the historical pricing of our goods and 
services is highly variable, we have established thresholds of pricing variability."
"For judging whether 
individually negotiated contractual renewal prices are substantive, we have established floor prices 
based on internal calculation which include a minimum margin that we use as SSPs whenever the 
contractual renewal prices are below these floor prices."
"In judging whether contracts are expected to 
renew at their contractual renewal prices, we rely on our respective renewal history."
"The SSPs of 
material right options depend on the probability of option exercise."
"In estimating these probabilities, 
we apply judgment considering historical exercise patterns."
"We review the SSPs periodically or whenever facts and circumstances change to ensure the most 
objective input parameters available are used."
"Recognition of Revenue 
Cloud revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed."
"For cloud business models 
where we grant rights to continuously access and use one or more cloud offerings for a certain term, 
revenue is recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over this term."
"In limited scenarios where the transaction price is 
entirely variable and determined by the customer’s consumption, we recognize revenue based on 
usage in the period in which it was earned."
"We recognize revenue for these on-premise 
licenses at the point in time when we grant the license rights to the customer and the customer has 
access to and thus control over the software."
"In judging whether our on-premise software offerings 
grant customers a right to use, rather than a right to access, our intellectual property, we have 
considered the usefulness of our software without subsequent updates to it."
"Judgment is required in identifying an appropriate method to measure the progress 
toward complete satisfaction of such performance obligations."
"This method of measuring progress faithfully 
depicts the transfer of the development services to the customer, as substantially all of these costs 
are cost of the staff or third parties performing the development work."
"In estimating the total cost to 
fully complete the development work, we consider our history with similar projects."
"– For agreements that combine the delivery of software and the obligation to deliver, in the future, 
unspecific software products, we recognize revenue at a point in time for licenses that are made 
immediately accessible to the customer."
"We recognize revenue ratably over the term of the 
software subscription contract for the unspecified software products, as our performance obligation 
is to stand ready to deliver such products on a when-and-if-available basis."
"Software support revenue is typically recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the 
term of the support arrangement."
"Under our standardized support services, our performance 
obligation is to stand ready to provide technical product support and unspecified updates, upgrades, 
and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis."
"Our customers simultaneously receive and 
consume the benefits of these support services as we perform."
Service revenue is typically recognized over time.
"Where we stand ready to provide the service (such 
as access to learning content), we recognize revenue based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the 
service period."
"Consumption-based services (such as separately identifiable consulting services and 
premium support services and classroom training services) are recognized over time as the services 
are utilized, typically following the percentage-of-completion method or ratably."
"When using the 
percentage-of-completion method, we typically measure the progress toward complete satisfaction of 
the performance obligation in the same way and with the same reasoning and judgment as we do for 
customer-specific on-premise software development agreements."
"We apply judgment in determining 
whether a service qualifies as a stand-ready service or as a consumption-based service."
"Revenue for combined performance obligations is recognized over the longest period of all promises 
in the combined performance obligation."
"Judgment is also required in determining whether revenue is to be recognized at a point in time or 
over time."
"For performance obligations satisfied over time, we need to measure progress using the 
method that best reflects SAP’s performance."
"When using cost incurred as a measure of progress for 
recognizing revenue over time, we apply judgment in estimating the total cost to satisfy the 
performance obligation."
"All of the judgments and estimates mentioned above can significantly impact the timing and amount of 
revenue to be recognized."
"Contract Balances 
We recognize trade receivables for performance obligations satisfied over time gradually as the 
performance obligation is satisfied and in full once the invoice is due."
"Judgment is required in 
determining whether a right to consideration is unconditional and thus qualifies as a receivable."
"Contract liabilities primarily reflect invoices due or payments received in advance of revenue 
recognition."
"Typically, we invoice fees for on-premise standard software on contract closure and software delivery."
"Periodic fixed fees for cloud subscription services, software support services, and other multi-period 
agreements are typically invoiced yearly or quarterly in advance."
"Such fee prepayments account for 
the majority of our contract liability balance."
"Fees based on actual transaction volumes for cloud 
subscriptions and fees charged for non-periodical services are invoiced as the services are delivered."
"While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type and region, our terms typically require 
payment within 30 to 60 days."
"Geographic Information 
The amounts for revenue by region in the following tables are based on the location of customers."
"The 
regions in the following table are EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Americas (North America and 
Latin America), and APJ (Asia Pacific Japan)."
"Remaining Performance Obligations 
Amounts of a customer contract’s transaction price that are allocated to the remaining performance 
obligations represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized."
"They include amounts 
recognized as contract liabilities and amounts that are contracted but not yet due."
"The transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially 
unsatisfied as at December 31, 2023, was €58.0 billion (December 31, 2022: €46.9 billion)."
"The 
transaction price thereof allocated to cloud performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially 
unsatisfied (total cloud backlog) as at December 31, 2023, was €44.3 billion 
(December 31, 2022: €32.4 billion)."
"The remaining amount mostly comprises obligations to provide 
software support services."
"The vast majority of software support contracts are contracts in the renewal 
phase that typically have a one-year contract term, while cloud subscription contracts typically are 
multiple-year contracts."
"The portion of remaining performance obligations related to services consists 
of non-cancelable revenue from contracts for projects with a predefined output."
"Overall, almost half of the total remaining performance obligations is expected to be recognized over 
the next 12 months following the respective balance sheet date."
"This estimate is based on several 
factors."
"For example, for certain cloud business models with a contractually agreed spend volume 
(consumption-based models), judgment is applied on customers’ deployment of the purchased 
solutions."
"The amount of revenue recognized in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability 
balance at the beginning of the reporting period was €4.5 billion (December 31, 2022: €4.1 billion)."
"We account for expected credit losses by recording an allowance on a 
portfolio basis."
We apply the simplified impairment approach.
"On initial measurement of the 
receivables, we consider all credit losses that are expected to occur during the lifetime of the 
receivables."
We use a provision matrix to estimate these losses.
"Additionally, we recognize allowances for individual receivables if there is objective evidence of credit 
impairment."
"Account balances are written off either partially or in full if we judge that the likelihood of recovery is 
remote."
"For information about how the default risk for trade receivables is analyzed and managed, how the 
loss rates for the provision matrix are determined, how credit impairment is determined and what our 
criteria for write-offs are, see the section on credit risk in Note (F.1)."
"In our Consolidated Income Statements, net gains/losses from expected credit loss allowances are 
included in Other operating income/expense, net."
"Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate 
fluctuations are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net."
Determining our expected credit loss allowance involves significant judgment.
"In this judgment, we 
primarily consider our historical experience with credit losses in the respective provision matrix risk 
class and current data on overdue receivables."
"We expect that our historical default rates represent a 
reasonable approximation for future expected customer defaults."
"Besides historical data, our 
judgment used in developing the provision matrix considers reasonable and supportable forward-
looking information (for example, changes in country risk ratings, and fluctuations in credit default 
swaps of the countries in which our customers are located)."
"The assessment of whether a receivable is collectible involves the use of judgment and requires us to 
make assumptions about customer defaults that could change significantly."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-24 
 
By applying this judgment, we record an allowance for a specific customer when it is probable that a 
credit loss has occurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable."
"Basing the expected 
credit loss allowance for the remaining receivables primarily on our historical loss experience likewise 
requires judgment, as history may not be indicative of future development."
"Also, including reasonable 
and supportable forward-looking information in the loss rates of the expected credit loss allowance 
requires judgment, as they may not provide a reliable prediction for future development."
"Contract 
assets as at December 31, 2023, were €307 million (December 31, 2022: €343 million)."
"For more information about financial risk, how we manage credit risk, and details of our trade 
receivables and contract assets allowances, see Note (F.1)."
"(A.3) 
Capitalized Cost from Contracts with Customers 
 Costs of Obtaining Customer Contracts 
Capitalized costs from customer contracts are classified as Other non-financial assets in our Statement 
of Financial Position."
"Judgment is required in determining the amounts to be capitalized, particularly where 
the commissions are based on cumulative targets and where commissions relate to multiple 
performance obligations in one customer contract."
"We capitalize such cumulative target commissions 
for all customer contracts that count towards the cumulative target but only if nothing other than 
obtaining customer contracts can contribute to achieving the cumulative target."
"Commissions for 
contracts with multiple performance obligations or for probable renewals thereof are allocated to 
these performance obligations and probable renewals relative to the respective standalone selling 
price."
"Our sales commission payments for customer contract renewals are typically not commensurate with 
the commissions paid for new contracts."
"Thus, the commissions paid for renewable new contracts also 
relate to expected renewals of these contracts."
"Consequently, we amortize sales commissions paid for 
new customer contracts on a straight-line basis over the expected contract life including probable 
contract renewals."
Judgment is required in estimating these contract lives.
"In exercising this judgment, 
we consider our expectation about future contract renewals which we evaluate periodically to confirm 
that the resulting amortization period properly reflects the expected contract life or if there are 
potential indicators of impairment."
"Commensurate payments are amortized over the contract term to 
which they relate."
The amortization periods range from 18 months to seven years depending on the type of offering.
"Amortization of the capitalized costs of obtaining customer contracts is classified mainly as sales and 
marketing expense."
"We expense the incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract as incurred if 
we expect an amortization period of one year or less."
"The regular review of the amortization periods resulted in a shorter contract life for on-premise 
support contracts and consequently in an accelerated amortization of costs related to these contracts."
"This results, for capitalized cost of obtaining customer contracts as of December 31, 2023, in higher 
amortization expenses amounting to €121 million for 2023 and approximately €80 million for 2024."
"These costs are amortized after completion 
of the setup and implementation or the development, respectively, on a straight-line basis over the 
expected life of the cloud subscription contract including expected renewals."
"For the life of the 
contract, we consider our expectation about future contract renewals which we evaluate periodically 
to confirm that the resulting amortization period properly reflects the expected contract life."
"The 
amortization periods range from five to eight years depending on the type of offering."
"In addition, the 
capitalized costs include third-party license fees which are amortized over the term of the third-party 
license contract."
"Judgment is required in evaluating whether costs are directly related to customer 
contracts and in estimating contract lives."
"Amortization of capitalized costs to fulfill contracts for custom cloud applications and extensions is 
included in the cost of cloud."
"We adjust these provisions as 
further information becomes available and as circumstances change."
"Non-current provisions are 
measured at the present value of their expected settlement amounts as at the reporting date."
"The unit of account for the identification of potential onerous customer contracts is based on the 
contract definition of IFRS 15 including the contract combination guidance."
"The economic benefits 
considered in the assessment comprise the future benefits we are directly entitled to under the 
contract as well as the anticipated future benefits that are the economic consequence of the contract 
if these benefits can be reliably determined."
"
 Customer-Related Litigation and Claims 
Customer-related provisions also include obligations resulting from customer-related litigation and 
claims."
"The obligations arising from customer-related 
litigation and claims comprise cases in which we indemnify our customers against liabilities arising 
from a claim that our products infringe a third party’s patent, copyright, trade secret, or other 
proprietary rights."
"Due to uncertainties relating to these matters, provisions are based on the best information available."
"Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether and when a provision is to be 
recorded and what the appropriate amount for such provision should be."
"Changes to the estimates and assumptions underlying our accounting for legal 
contingencies, and outcomes that differ from these estimates and assumptions, could require material 
adjustments to the carrying amounts of the respective provisions recorded and additional provisions."
"Contingent liabilities exist in respect of customer-related litigation and claims for which no provision 
has been recognized."
"It is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of these contingent liabilities 
due to the uncertainties around these lawsuits and claims as outlined above."

Section B – Employees 
This section provides financial insights into our employee benefit arrangements."
"It should be read in 
conjunction with the compensation disclosures for key management personnel in Note (G.5)."
"(B.1) 
Employee Headcount 
The following table provides an overview of employee headcount, broken down by function and by 
the regions EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Americas (North America and Latin America), and 
APJ (Asia Pacific Japan)."
"The 
respective expenses are recognized as employee benefits and classified in our Consolidated Income 
Statements according to the activities that the receiving employees perform."
"Valuation, Judgment, and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty 
We use certain assumptions in estimating the fair values for our share-based payments, including 
expected share price volatility and expected dividend yields."
"In addition, the final number of 
Performance Share Units (PSUs) vesting also depends on the achievement of performance indicators."
"Furthermore, the payout for cash-settled share units depends on our share price on the respective 
vesting dates."
"Changes to these assumptions and outcomes that differ from these assumptions could 
require material adjustments to the carrying amount of the liabilities we have recognized for these 
share-based payments."
"With respect to our LTI 2020, we believe that future payout will be significantly impacted not only by 
our share price but also by the relative TSR performance against the NASDAQ-100 companies."
"Future 
payouts under our LTI 2020 will also be dependent on meeting non-market-based performance 
conditions based on SAP’s long-term strategy."
"The latter, however, is not incorporated into our fair 
value calculation but leads to adjustments of the quantity of awards granted."
"Changes in these factors 
could significantly affect the estimated fair values as calculated by the valuation model, and the future 
payout."
"Under the OWN SAP share purchase plan, we grant our employees discounts on share purchases."
"As 
those discounts are not dependent on future services to be provided by our employees, the discount 
is recognized as an expense when the discounts are granted."
"Presentation in the Statements of Cash Flows  
We present the payments of our cash-settled share-based payment plans separately in our 
Statements of Cash Flows under Cash flows from operating activities."
"As a result, the changes in other 
assets and in other liabilities presented in the reconciliation of operating cash flow do not consider 
share-based payment-related assets or liabilities."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-29 
 
Our major share-based payment plans are described below."
"a) Equity-Settled Share-Based Payments 
Equity-Settled Move SAP Plan (Move) 
Starting in 2022, we decided to grant share units under Move that we intend to predominantly settle in 
shares instead of cash."
"For more information about the terms and conditions of the cash-settled Move, 
see section b) Cash-Settled Share-Based Payments in this Note (B.3)."
Different vesting schedules apply to specific share units.
"The number of PSUs that will vest under the different tranches is mainly contingent upon achievement 
of two equally weighted KPIs in the year of grant: Operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) 
and Cloud revenue (at constant currencies)."
"Depending on the weighted average performance, the 
number of PSUs vesting ranges between 0% and 200% of the number initially granted."
"Performance 
against the KPI target was 112.4% in 2023 (2022: 84.3%)."
"We intend to settle the share units classified as equity-settled by reissuing treasury shares upon 
vesting (for more information, see Note (E.2))."
"Share units with switched classification are considered in the number of 
granted share units."
The weighted average share price for awards exercised in 2023 was €130.59 (2022: €92.00).
"Own SAP Plan (Own) 
Under the share purchase plan Own, employees have the opportunity to purchase, on a monthly basis, 
SAP shares without any required holding period."
"The investment per each eligible employee is limited 
to a percentage of the respective employee’s monthly base salary."
"SAP matches the employee 
investment by 40% and adds a subsidy of €20 per month for non-executives."
"As part of SAP’s 
50th anniversary celebration, SAP’s contribution was temporarily doubled from 40% to 80% from 
January to March 2022, contributing to the peak in 2022."
"This plan is not open to members of the 
Executive Board."

As a result of Own, we have commitments to grant SAP shares to employees."
"We have fulfilled and 
intend to continue to meet these commitments through an agent who administers the equity-settled 
programs and purchases shares on the open market."
"Since 2022, we intend to settle share units granted from then on 
predominantly in shares."
"For more information about the terms and conditions of the equity-settled 
Move, see section a) Equity-Settled Share-Based Payments in this Note (B.3)."
"Obligations from 
outstanding share units granted before 2022 will continue to be settled in cash."
"From 2020 to 2023, we granted share units under the Grow SAP Plan that we intend to settle in cash."
"This fixed term plan has broadly the same terms and conditions as Move and recognizes all 
employees’ commitment to SAP’s success, and deepens their participation in our future company 
performance."
Different vesting schedules apply to specific share units.
"The number of PSUs that will vest under the different tranches is mainly contingent upon achievement 
of two equally weighted KPIs in the year of grant: operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) and 
cloud revenue (at constant currencies)."
"Depending on the weighted average performance, the number 
of PSUs vesting ranges between 0% and 200% of the number initially granted."
"Performance against the 
KPI target was 112.4% in 2023 (2022: 84.3%, 2021: 130.9%)."
The share units classified as cash-settled are paid out in cash upon vesting.
"SAP Long-Term Incentive Program 2020 (LTI 2020) 
The LTI 2020 is a long-term, multiyear performance-based element of our Executive Board 
compensation that is granted in annual tranches."
"The LTI 2020 reflects SAP’s long-term strategy and 
thus sets uniform incentives to achieve key targets from the long-term strategic plans."
"The LTI 2020 also 
serves to reward the Executive Board members for long-term SAP share price performance as 
compared to the market, thus ensuring that shareholders’ interests are also honored."
"In addition, the 
LTI 2020 includes a component to ensure long-term retention of our Executive Board members."
"The LTI 2020 is a virtual share program under which annual tranches with a term of approximately four 
years each are granted."
"When the individual tranches are granted, a certain grant amount specified in 
the Executive Board member’s service contract is converted into virtual shares (share units)."
"For this 
purpose, the grant amount is divided by the price of the SAP share which corresponds to the 
arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of the 
preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole (grant price)."
"The share units 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-32 
 
allocated are composed of 1/3 Financial Performance Share Units (FSUs), 1/3 Market Performance 
Share Units (MSUs), and 1/3 Retention Share Units."
"All three types of share units have a vesting period 
of approximately four years."
"In contrast to Retention Share Units, FSUs and MSUs are subject to 
changes in quantity."
"In this context, the following applies: 
The number of FSUs initially awarded is multiplied by a performance factor."
"The performance factor 
consists of three equally weighted individual performance indicators relating to the three non-IFRS 
KPIs at constant currencies, derived from SAP’s long-term strategy: total revenue, cloud revenue, and 
operating income."
"The performance period throughout which the target achievement for these three 
KPIs is measured starts at the beginning of the financial year in which the FSUs are awarded and 
concludes upon the end of the second year following the year in which the share units were awarded."
A numerical target value equaling 100% target achievement is set for each KPI.
"This constitutes, in each 
case, a cumulative value for the three years of the performance period."
The number of MSUs initially awarded is likewise multiplied by a performance factor.
"The performance 
factor depends on the amount of the TSR on the SAP share, measured for an entire performance 
period of approximately three years, compared to the TSR for NASDAQ-100 companies."
"If the TSR on 
the SAP share equals the median, the performance factor will be 100%."
"If the TSR on the SAP share 
over the performance period is negative, the maximum performance factor will, however, in deviation 
from the summary above, be 100%."
"The performance of the share units is linked to the performance of the SAP share price, including 
dividend payments."
"The arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading 
days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-33 
 
whole will be used as the SAP share price."
"The payout amount per share unit, including the dividend 
amounts due on the share units, is capped at 200% of the grant price."
"The tranche is cash-settled and 
paid in euros after the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the corresponding year."
"An LTI tranche was granted annually 
and had a term of four years (2016–2019 tranches)."
"All share units granted in this way, comprising 60% PSUs and 40% Retention Share Units, had a vesting 
period of approximately four years."
"At the end of the vesting period, the corresponding share units 
were non-forfeitable."
"The payout price used for the settlement was the arithmetic mean of the XETRA 
closing prices of the SAP share on the 20 trading days following the publication of SAP’s fourth-quarter 
results subsequent to the end of the vesting period."
"The payout price was capped at 300% of the 
grant price."
"The number of PSUs ultimately paid out was dependent on the performance of the SAP 
share – absolute and relative to the Peer Group Index."
"The LTI tranche was cash-settled and paid in 
euros after the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting of the corresponding year."
"The last LTI tranche 
2019 was paid out in 2023."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-34 
 
For the LTI 2020 valuation, the NASDAQ-100 Total Return Index on December 31, 2023, was 
US$20,158.42 (2022: US$12,994.57)."
"The expected volatility of the NASDAQ-100 companies of 34% to 
36% (2022: 36% to 41%), and the expected correlation of SAP and the NASDAQ-100 companies of 
24% to 27% (2022: 26% to 32%) are based on historical TSR data for SAP and the NASDAQ-100 
companies."
The risk-free interest rate is derived from German government bonds with a similar duration.
"The SAP 
dividend yield is based on expected future dividends."
"Share units with switched classification are considered in the number of 
granted share units."
"In Germany and some 
other countries, we make contributions to public pension schemes that are operated by national or 
local government or similar institutions."
"Expenses for such local state pension plans are recognized as 
short-term employee benefits, that is, social security expenses."
"Net 
interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized as employee 
benefits expenses and classified in our Consolidated Income Statements according to the activities 
that the employees owning the awards perform."
"Such adjustments are 
recorded in service cost."
"Total expenses on defined benefit pension plans comprise related current 
and past service costs as well as interest income and expense."
"The 
sensitivity analysis considers change in discount rate assumptions, holding all other actuarial 
assumptions constant."
"Our investment strategies for foreign benefit plans vary according to the conditions in the country in 
which the respective benefit plans are situated."
"We have adopted a long-term investment horizon for 
all major foreign benefit plans."
"Although our policy is to invest in a risk-diversified portfolio consisting of 
a mix of assets, both the defined benefit obligation and plan assets can fluctuate over time, which 
exposes the Group to actuarial and market (investment) risks."
"Depending on the statutory 
requirements in each country, it might be necessary to reduce any underfunding by addition of liquid 
assets."
"The weighted duration of our defined benefit plans amounted to 10 years as at 
December 31, 2023 and 2022."
"Total future benefit payments from our defined benefit plans as at December 31, 2023, are expected 
to be €2,707 million (2022: €2,404 million)."
"Of this amount, 76% (2022: 76%) have maturities of over five 
years, and 55% (2022: 61%) relate to domestic plans."
"(B.5) 
Other Employee-Related Obligations 
 Accounting Policy 
As far as the obligation for long-term employee benefits is secured by pledged reinsurance coverage, it 
is offset with the relating plan asset."
"We consider whether a change in business is material based on the business affected rather than for 
SAP as a whole."
"In judging whether a unit qualifies as a business for restructuring purposes, we 
consider if the unit has its own management team, has access to all inputs and processes necessary to 
provide outputs, and generates or could generate revenues."
"The materiality of a change to a business 
is assessed based on both the size and the nature of the change and therefore does not necessarily 
involve a material quantitative impact on our financial statements."
"Restructuring expenses 
primarily include employee-related benefits such as severance payments."
"The restructuring costs 
presented in 2022 mainly include expenses related to the wind-down of business in Russia and 
Belarus."
"This includes but is not limited to segment results, 
income taxes, and earnings per share."
"The operating segments are 
largely organized and managed separately according to their product and service offerings."
"The 
Applications, Technology & Services (ATS) segment is SAP’s only reportable segment."
"In the first quarter of 2023, the non-reportable SAP Signavio segment was dissolved and integrated 
into the Applications, Technology & Services segment."
"At the end of the second quarter of 2023, we sold our stake in Qualtrics, a formerly reportable 
segment."
"For more information about the sale of Qualtrics, see Note (D.1)."
"Due to their size, the following segments are non-reportable: 
– The Emarsys segment derives its revenues mainly from the sale of cloud-based customer 
experience offerings and from the sale of related services."
– The Taulia segment derives its revenues mainly from the sale of working capital solutions.
"– The Business Network segment combines SAP’s network offerings, covering procurement, logistics, 
asset management, and industry-specific solutions spanning end-to-end value chains."
"The segment 
generates revenues from cloud application subscriptions, transactional fees, and services."
"The segment information for 2023 and the comparative prior periods were restated to conform with 
the new segment composition."
"
 Segment Reporting Policies 
Our management reporting system, and hence our segment reporting system, reports our 
intersegment services as cost reductions and does not track them as internal revenue."
"Intersegment 
services mainly represent utilization of human resources of one segment by another segment on a 
project basis."
"Intersegment services are charged based on internal cost rates including certain indirect 
overhead costs but excluding a profit margin."
"Most of our depreciation and amortization expense affecting segment profits is allocated to the 
segments as part of broader infrastructure allocations and is thus not tracked separately on the 
operating segment level."
"Other depreciation and amortization expense is directly allocated to the 
operating segments."
"Our management reporting system produces a variety of reports that differ by the currency exchange 
rates used in the accounting for foreign-currency transactions and operations, where both actual and 
constant currency numbers are reported to and used by our CODM."
"Reports based on actual 
currencies use the same currency rates as are used in our financial statements."
"Reports based on 
constant currencies report revenues and expenses using the average exchange rates from the previous 
year’s corresponding period."
We use an operating profit indicator to measure the performance of our operating segments.
"Revenues and expenses of our operating but non-reportable segments, and the certain activities 
managed on corporate level, as outlined above, are presented under the Other revenue and Other 
expenses items in the reconciliation in Note (C.2)."
"Information about assets and liabilities and additions to non-current assets by segment is not regularly 
provided to our Executive Board."
Goodwill by segment is disclosed in Note (D.2).
"Directly allocated depreciation and amortization expense in the ATS segment decreased compared to 
2022 by 23% (22% at constant currency) from €639 million to €491 million."
"(C.5) 
Income Taxes 
 Judgments and Estimates 
We are subject to changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions within the countries in which we operate."
"Our ordinary business activities also include transactions where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
due to different interpretations of tax laws, such as those involving transfer pricing and intercompany 
transactions between SAP Group entities."
"In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is generally 
subject to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities."
"In 
applying these judgments, we consider the nature and the individual facts and circumstances of each 
uncertain tax treatment as well as the specifics of the respective jurisdiction, including applicable tax 
laws and our interpretation thereof."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-43 
 
The assessment whether a deferred tax asset is impaired requires judgment, as we need to estimate 
future taxable profits to determine whether the utilization of the deferred tax asset is probable."
"In 
evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative 
evidence, including the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income 
over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are recoverable."
"Our judgment regarding future 
taxable income is based on assumptions about future market conditions and future profits of SAP."
"Judgment is also required in evaluating whether interest or penalties related to income taxes meet the 
definition of income taxes, and, if not, whether it is of financial nature."
"In this judgment, we particularly 
consider applicable local tax laws and interpretations on IFRS by national standard setters in the area 
of group financial reporting."
"Our 
2023 combined German tax rate includes a corporate income tax rate of 15.0% (2022: 15.0%; 
2021: 15.0%), plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% (2022: 5.5%; 2021: 5.5%) thereon, and trade taxes of 
10.7% (2022: 10.6%; 2021: 10.6%)."
"The presentation for 
2022 remains unchanged in this respect."
"state tax 
loss carryforwards."
"Income Tax-Related Litigation 
We are subject to ongoing tax audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities."
"Currently, we are in 
dispute mainly with the German and only a few foreign tax authorities."
"The German dispute is in 
respect of certain secured capital investments, while the few foreign disputes are mainly in respect of 
the deductibility of intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services."
"In all cases, we expect 
that a favorable outcome can only be achieved through litigation."
"For all of these matters, we have not 
recorded a provision as we believe that the tax authorities’ claims have no merit and that no 
adjustment is warranted."
"Reform of International Taxation Rules 
In October 2021, over 135 jurisdictions agreed on a new framework for the international tax system 
covering the re-allocation of taxing rights and the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax rate."
"In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released 
model rules, which shall ensure that multinational enterprises with revenue above €750 million will be 
subject to a 15% minimum corporate tax rate."
"In December 2022, the Member States of the European 
Union (EU) adopted a directive on a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise 
groups and large-scale domestic groups in the EU."
"By the end of 2023, Germany transposed the EU 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-46 
 
directive into national law, applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 30, 2023."
"SAP has 
performed an assessment of its potential exposure to the global minimum tax legislation."
"This 
assessment is based on our current understanding of the global minimum taxation rules and on the 
most recent information available regarding the financial performance of the constituent entities within 
SAP."
Our simulation reveals that SAP should not be materially affected.
"SAP has applied the temporary 
mandatory exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and 
liabilities related to the global minimum tax."
"Additions to invested capital include separate asset acquisitions or business 
combinations."
"Further, we disclose information about purchase obligations and capital contributions."
We classify costs related to executing business combinations as general and administration expense.
"In our accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in determining whether an 
intangible asset is identifiable and whether it should be recorded separately from goodwill."
"Additionally, estimating the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed involves considerable judgment."
"The necessary measurements are based on information 
available on the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been 
deemed reasonable by management."
"– Subsequent negative changes in the estimated fair values of assets may result in additional 
expense from impairment charges."
"– Subsequent changes in the estimated fair values of liabilities and provisions may result in additional 
expense (if increasing the estimated fair value) or additional income (if decreasing the estimated fair 
value)."
"We acquire businesses in specific areas of strategic interest to us, particularly to broaden our product 
and service portfolio."
"2023 Acquisitions 
LeanIX Acquisition 
On September 7, 2023, SAP announced its intent to acquire 100% of the shares of LeanIX GmbH 
(“LeanIX”), a leader in enterprise architecture management (EAM) software."
"The acquisition closed on November 7, 2023, following satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
and regulatory approvals; the operating results and the assets and liabilities are reflected in our 
Consolidated Financial Statements starting on that date."
"The acquisition is expected to further expand SAP’s business transformation portfolio, giving 
customers access to the full suite of tools required for continuous business transformation and 
facilitating AI-enabled process optimization."
"Consideration transferred amounted to €1,231 million paid in cash."
"In general, the goodwill arising from our acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and the know-
how and skills of the acquired businesses’ workforces."
"For more information, see Note (D.2)."
"2023 Divestitures 
Qualtrics Disposal 
On March 13, 2023, resulting from a process that was initiated on January 26, 2023, SAP announced it 
had agreed to sell all of its 423 million shares of Qualtrics International Inc."
"as part of the acquisition of 
Qualtrics by funds affiliated with Silver Lake as well as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board."
"The 
sale closed on June 28, 2023, following satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory 
approvals."
"At a purchase price of US$18.15 in cash per share, SAP’s stake was acquired for 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-49 
 
approximately US$7.7 billion."
"To secure the euro countervalue of the US$7.7 billion purchase price, we 
hedged an amount of US$7.1 billion by entering into a deal contingent forward applying net 
investment hedge accounting."
"For more information, see Note (F.1)."
"At the time that Qualtrics was 
classified as a discontinued operation (following IFRS 5), there was no indication of an impairment (as 
the fair value less cost of disposal (calculated based on share prices) significantly exceeded the 
carrying amount)."
SAP is a close go-to-market and technology partner for Qualtrics.
SAP’s financial results present Qualtrics as a discontinued operation as required under IFRS 5.
"The 
Qualtrics disposal group was previously included in the Qualtrics reportable segment."
"SAP incurred taxes amounting to €799 million in connection with 
the transaction."
"The cash inflow resulting from the purchase price (€7,068 million) was offset by cash and cash 
equivalents of €713 million leaving the SAP Group."
SAP continues to provide rental guarantees for certain offices used by Qualtrics.
"Qualtrics is obligated 
to indemnify SAP with respect to the guarantees."
"2 For 2023 and 2022, the weighted average number of shares was 1,167 million (diluted: 1.180 million) and 1,170 million (diluted: 1,175 million), 
respectively (treasury stock excluded)."
"Total operating expenses includes share-based payment expenses related to Qualtrics’ equity-settled 
plan of €403 million in 2023 (€1,182 million in 2022)."

2022 Acquisitions 
In 2022, we closed the acquisition of Taulia Inc., San Francisco, California (USA) (“Taulia”) and of 
INNAAS srl, Rome (Italy)."
"Taulia Acquisition 
On January 27, 2022, SAP announced its intent to acquire a majority stake of Taulia (for information 
about SAP’s current shareholding percentage, see Note (G.9)), a leading provider of cloud-based 
working capital management solutions."
"The acquisition closed on March 9, 2022, following satisfaction 
of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals; the operating results and the assets and 
liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements starting on that date."
Consideration transferred amounted to €705 million.
"Based on the setup of the compartments and series 
within which the SCF receivables and liabilities are siloed, and on the related contractual and founding 
agreements, we concluded that we do not control the receivables and liabilities resulting from the SCF 
activities under IFRS 10."
"Thus, we do not include the respective items in our balance sheet and do not 
show cash flows linked to the SCF transactions in investing/financing cash flow."
"In Q1 2023, measurement of tax-related assets and liabilities for the Taulia business combination 
accounting was completed and resulted in €28 million adjusted to the Other identifiable assets’ 
opening balance and Goodwill."
"In general, the goodwill arising from our acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and the know-
how and skills of the acquired businesses’ workforces."
"2022 Divestitures 
On August 17, 2022, SAP and Francisco Partners (FP) announced that FP had signed a definitive 
agreement with SAP America, Inc."
under which FP would acquire SAP Litmos from SAP.
"The transaction 
closed on December 1, 2022, following satisfaction of applicable regulatory and other approvals."
"The disposal gain of €175 million is included in Other operating income/expense, net."
"2021 Acquisitions 
In 2021, we closed the acquisition of Signavio GmbH, Berlin (Germany) (“Signavio”) and of 
Clarabridge, Inc., Reston, Virginia (USA) (“Clarabridge”)."
The purchase price was €949 million.
"The transaction closed on March 5, 2021, following satisfaction of 
regulatory and other approvals."
"The Signavio operating results and assets and liabilities are reflected in 
our consolidated financial statements starting on that date."
"– Improved profitability in Signavio sales and operations 
The allocation of the goodwill resulting from the Signavio acquisition to our operating segments 
depends on how our operating segments actually benefit from the synergies of the Signavio business 
combination."
"The number of Qualtrics class 
A common stock issued to the sellers was fixed based on a valuation of US$1,125 million (subject to 
certain adjustments) – the assumed Qualtrics share price was US$37.33."
"The actual consideration 
transferred (mainly in shares valued at the acquisition date fair value of the common stock) amounted 
to US$1,298 million (€1,116 million)."
"This includes €910 million of issued shares, €115 million of 
assumed awards, and €91 million of cash paid."
"Qualtrics has (1) assumed, amended, and restated Clarabridge stock plans, and (2) converted the 
assumed options to purchase shares of Clarabridge stock outstanding into corresponding Qualtrics 
options."
"Qualtrics has granted equity incentive awards to certain continuing employees of Clarabridge 
and its subsidiaries under its own Qualtrics equity plan at Qualtrics’ sole discretion."
"The Clarabridge goodwill consists largely of the synergies that SAP expects to achieve from combining 
the acquired assets and operations with its existing operations, especially in its Qualtrics subsidiary."
"2021 Divestitures 
On April 13, 2021, SAP and investment company Dediq GmbH, Munich (Germany) (“Dediq”) 
announced that they had agreed to enter into a partnership in the area of financial services."
"Following 
the close of the transaction in September 2021 (after satisfaction of all closing conditions including 
regulatory approvals), SAP and Dediq jointly own the new SAP Fioneer entity (with SAP owning a 
minority share)."
"SAP and SAP Fioneer have executed transition service and go-to-market agreements, among others."
"The disposal gain relating to the transfer of the business (predominantly IP and employees) was 
included in Other operating income/expense, net (€77 million)."
"(D.2) 
Goodwill 
 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Testing 
The annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of our operating segments, since there 
are no lower levels in SAP at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes."
"In general, the test is performed at the same time (at the beginning of the fourth quarter) for all 
operating segments."
"In making impairment assessments for our goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of these tests 
is highly dependent on management’s assumptions regarding future cash flow projections and 
economic risks, which require significant judgment and assumptions about future developments."
"The outcome of goodwill impairment tests may also depend on the allocation of goodwill to our 
operating segments."
"This allocation involves judgment as it is based on our estimates regarding which 
operating segments are expected to benefit from the synergies of business combinations."
"Changes in our segment structure result in the reallocation of goodwill with the reallocated goodwill 
being calculated based on relative values (if a direct allocation is not possible)."
"Throughout 2023, we have – through a qualitative and quantitative analysis – been continuously 
monitoring whether triggering events exist."
"We did not identify any triggering events that would indicate 
or cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount."
2 Taulia goodwill opening balance was adjusted by €28 million in 2023.
"Due to the dissolution of the SAP Signavio segment at the beginning of 2023 (for more information, see 
Note (C.1)), the SAP Signavio goodwill (€410 million) was moved to the Applications, Technology & 
Services segment."
"Given the close proximity to the 2022 annual goodwill impairment test and the 
significant headroom, no formal impairment test was performed on the reallocation date of the 
SAP Signavio segment."
"Based on the expected synergies, the goodwill added through the acquisition of LeanIX (€867 million) 
was provisionally allocated to the Applications, Technology & Services segment on December 31."
"As 
the initial accounting for the LeanIX business combination is incomplete (for more information, see 
Note (D.1)), the allocation is provisional."
"The goodwill impairment test for the Applications, Technology 
& Services segment on October 1 resulted in a headroom that is significantly higher than the portion of 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-55 
 
the goodwill that – at the end of December – was allocated to the segment."
"Thus, there is no 
impairment risk resulting from the allocation of the LeanIX goodwill."
"Values assigned reflect our past 
experience and our expectations regarding an increase in the addressable markets."
"Budgeted operating margin 
Operating margin budgeted for a given budget period equals the operating margin achieved in the current year, increased by 
expected efficiency gains."
"Values assigned reflect past experience, except for efficiency gains."
"Discount rates 
Our estimated cash flow projections are discounted to present value using discount rates (after-tax rates)."
"Discount rates are 
based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach."
"Terminal growth rate 
Our estimated cash flow projections for periods beyond the business plan were extrapolated using segment-specific terminal 
growth rates."
"These growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which our segments 
operate."
"On October 1, 2023, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the operating segments."
"Applications, Technology & Services Segment 
For more information about our 2023 segment changes, see Note (C.1)."
The recoverable amount was determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation.
"The 
fair value measurement was categorized as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs used in the 
valuation."
"The cash flow projections were based on actual operating results and specific estimates 
covering a detailed planning period and the terminal growth rate thereafter."
"The projected results were 
determined based on management’s estimates and are consistent with the assumptions a market 
participant would make (a target operating margin of 34.5% (2022: 27.8%) was used in the valuation)."
"We believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the 
carrying amount of our Applications, Technology & Services segment to exceed the recoverable 
amount."

completion of an asset is technically feasible requires judgment and a company-specific approach."
"
 Measurement of Intangibles 
All our purchased intangible assets other than goodwill have finite useful lives."
"They are initially 
measured at acquisition cost and subsequently amortized based on the expected consumption of 
economic benefits over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to 20 years."
"
 Classification of Intangibles 
We classify intangible assets according to their nature and use in our operations."
"Software and 
database licenses consist primarily of technology for internal use, whereas acquired technology 
consists primarily of purchased software to be incorporated into our product offerings."
"Customer 
relationships and other intangibles consist primarily of customer relationships and acquired trademark 
licenses."
"Amortization expenses of intangible assets are classified as Cost of cloud, Cost of services, Research 
and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administration, depending on the use of the 
respective intangible assets."
"Judgment is 
required in estimating the useful life of the assets."
"In this assessment we consider, among others, our 
history with similar assets and current and future changes in technology."
"For more information about leases, see Note (D.5)."
"(D.5) 
Leases 
 Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates 
Under IFRS 16, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration."
"As a lessee, SAP recognizes a right-
of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its 
obligation to make lease payments."
"The right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis and 
interest expense is recognized on the lease liabilities."
"The vast majority of our leases consist of facility 
and data center leases."
"Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease 
term."
Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain.
"For more information about the cash flow related to lease liabilities, see 
the “Reconciliation of Liabilities Arising from Financing Activities” table within Note (E.3)."
"For equity securities, as the cash flow characteristics are other than solely principal and interest, we 
take an investment-by-investment decision whether to classify as FVTPL or FVOCI."
"The valuation of equity securities of private companies requires judgment because it is typically based 
on significant unobservable inputs, as no market prices are available and there is inherent lack of 
liquidity."
"We take the most recent qualitative and quantitative information aspects into consideration to 
determine the fair value estimates of these equity securities."
"Gains/losses on equity securities at FVTPL include gains/losses from fair value fluctuations, from 
disposals as well as dividends, while gains/losses on equity securities at FVOCI only include dividends, 
all of which are shown in Financial income, net."
"Regular way purchases and sales are recorded as at 
the trade date."
"We own more than 20% of the 
equity interests or have at least 20% of the voting rights in these entities."
"Based on these facts and the 
nature of the relationships, SAP has determined that it has significant influence."

"Our capital management is based on a 
high equity ratio, modest financial leverage, a well-balanced maturity profile, and deep debt capacity."
"(E.1) 
Capital Structure Management 
The primary objective of our capital structure management is to maintain a strong financial profile for 
investor, creditor, and customer confidence, and to support the growth of our business."
"We seek to 
maintain a capital structure that will allow us to continuously cover our funding requirements through 
the capital markets on reasonable terms and, in so doing, ensure a high level of independence, 
confidence, and financial flexibility."
"SAP’s prime principle of financial risk management is to safeguard liquidity at a level to be able to 
meet all our financial obligations."
"The ratio of total nominal volume of financial debt to total equity and 
liabilities decreased 5 pp."
"Applying IFRS 5, prior-year numbers include amounts attributable to 
Qualtrics."

Total Equity 
 Accounting for Interests in Subsidiaries 
Changes in SAP's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as 
equity transactions."
"When SAP loses control over the subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and 
liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests (NCI) and other components of 
equity."
Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.
"Issued Capital 
SAP SE has issued no-par value bearer shares with a calculated nominal value of €1 per share."
"All of 
the shares issued are fully paid."
"With a total volume of up to €1,250 million, the program will 
run until February 19, 2024."
"By December 31, 2023, we had repurchased shares with a total volume of 
€949 million."
"In addition, we reissued 7.7 million treasury shares to service share-based payment 
awards under our Move SAP Plan in 2023."
"Authorized Shares 
The Articles of Incorporation authorize the Executive Board to increase the issued capital as follows: 
– By up to a total amount of €250 million by issuing new no-par value bearer shares against 
contributions in cash until May 19, 2025 (Authorized Capital I)."
"The issuance is subject to the 
statutory subscription rights of existing shareholders."
"– By up to a total amount of €250 million by issuing new no-par value bearer shares against 
contributions in cash or in kind until May 19, 2025 (Authorized Capital II)."
"Subject to the consent of 
the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board is authorized to exclude the shareholders’ statutory 
subscription rights in certain cases."
"As at December 31, 2023, €100 million, representing 100 million shares, was still available for 
issuance (2022: €100 million)."
"Retained Earnings 
Retained earnings mainly comprise profit after tax and dividend payments as well as transactions with 
non-controlling interests."
"Although treasury shares are legally considered 
outstanding, there are no dividend or voting rights associated with them."
"We may redeem or resell 
shares held in treasury, or we may use treasury shares for the purpose of servicing option or 
conversion rights under the Company’s share-based payment plans."
"Also, we may use shares held in 
treasury as consideration in connection with mergers with, or acquisitions of, other companies."
"Following the above authorization, in May 2023 we announced a new share buyback program with an 
aggregate volume of up to €5 billion and a term until December 31, 2025."
"As part of the first tranche of 
this program, we acquired shares with a volume of €949 million (without incidental acquisition costs) 
between August 14, 2023, and December 31, 2023."
"Distribution Policy and Dividends 
Our general intention is to remain in a position to return liquidity to our shareholders by distributing 
annual dividends totaling 40% or more of our profit after tax and by potentially repurchasing treasury 
shares in future."
"In 2023, we distributed €2,395 million (€2.05 per share) in dividends for 2022, compared to 
€2,865 million (€2.45 per share, including a special dividend of €0.50 to celebrate SAP’s 50th 
anniversary) paid in 2022 for 2021 and €2,182 million (€1.85 per share) paid in 2021 for 2020."
"The total dividend available for distribution to SAP SE shareholders is based on the profits of SAP SE 
as reported in its statutory financial statements prepared under the accounting rules in the German 
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)."
"For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Executive 
Board intends to propose that a dividend of €2.20 per share (that is, an estimated total dividend of 
€2,568 million), be paid from the profits of SAP SE."
"Non-Controlling Interests 
Until divestiture in June 2023, Qualtrics issued new shares to serve share-based payment awards 
under the Qualtrics Omnibus plan, which further reduced SAP’s ownership in Qualtrics to 69% 
(2022: 71%)."
"In the first half of 2023, a loss of €141 million (2022: €366 million) was attributed to non-
controlling interests of Qualtrics."
"For more information about the divestiture of Qualtrics, see 
Note (D.1)."
"In 2023, a loss of €33 million (2022: €210 million) was attributed to non-controlling interests 
of other SAP entities."
"We generally classify financial assets as: at amortized cost (AC), at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI), or at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the 
contractual cash flows of, and our business model for, holding the respective asset."
"Financial assets 
having cash flow characteristics other than solely principal and interest such as money market and 
similar funds are classified as FVTPL."
"Generally, other financial assets with cash flows consisting solely 
of principal and interest are held within a business model whose objective is “hold to collect” and are 
thus classified as AC."
"Occasionally, such other financial assets are held within a business model whose 
objective is “hold to collect and sell” in which case they are classified as FVOCI."
"Gains/losses on non-derivative financial debt investments at FVTPL are reported in Financial income, 
net and show interest income/expenses separately from other gains/losses which include gains/losses 
from fair value fluctuations and disposals."
"Gains/losses on non-derivative financial debt investments at 
AC are reported in Financial income, net and show interest income/expenses separately from other 
gains/losses which include gains/losses on disposals and changes in expected and incurred credit 
losses."
"Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in Other non-
operating income/expense, net."
Regular way purchases and sales are recorded as at the trade date.
"Thus, these assets are always allocated to stage 1 of the three-stage credit loss model, 
and we record a loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses."
"This loss 
allowance is calculated based on our exposure at the respective reporting date, the loss given 
default for this exposure, and the credit default swap spread as a measure for the probability of 
default."
"Such financial assets are written off either partially or in full if 
the likelihood of recovery is considered remote, which might be evidenced, for example, by the 
bankruptcy of a counterparty of such financial assets."
"– Loans and other financial receivables are monitored based on borrower-specific internal and 
external information to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition."
"We consider such assets to be in default if they are significantly beyond their due 
date or if the borrower is unlikely to pay its obligation."
"A write-off occurs when the likelihood of 
recovery is considered remote, for example when bankruptcy proceedings have been finalized or 
when all enforcement efforts have been exhausted."
"Non-Derivative Financial Liabilities 
Non-derivative financial liabilities include bank loans, issued bonds, private placements, and other 
financial liabilities."
"Other financial liabilities also include customer funding liabilities which are funds we 
draw from and make payments on behalf of our customers for customers’ employee expense 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-68 
 
reimbursements, related credit card payments, and vendor payments."
"We present these funds in cash 
and cash equivalents and record our obligation to make these expense reimbursements and 
payments on behalf of our customers as customer funding liabilities."
"As we do not designate financial liabilities as FVTPL, we generally classify non-derivative financial 
liabilities as AC."
"Expenses and gains or losses on financial liabilities at AC mainly consist of interest expense which is 
shown in Financial income, net."
"Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are 
included in Other non-operating income/expense, net."
"Group Liquidity, Financial Debt, and Net Debt 
Group liquidity consists of cash at banks, money market and other funds, as well as time deposits and 
debt securities (both with remaining maturities of less than one year)."
"Financial debt is defined as the 
nominal volume of bank loans, issued commercial papers, private placements, and bonds."
"Net debt is 
group liquidity less financial debt."
"Debt securities consist of acquired commercial 
papers and acquired bonds of mainly financial and non-financial corporations and municipalities."
"The increase in time deposits presented as cash equivalents and current investments and the increase 
in money market funds in 2023 are due to the proceeds from the Qualtrics divestiture."
"For more information about financial risk and the nature of risk, see Note (F.1)."
"Trade-debtors with credit balances for 2023 are

The presentation for 2022 remains unchanged.
"Financial liabilities are unsecured, except for the retention of title and similar rights customary in our 
industry."
"Effective interest rates on our financial debt (including the effects from interest rate swaps)

Financial Risk Factors 
This section discusses financial risk factors and risk management regarding foreign currency exchange 
rate risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk."
"Further, it contains information 
about financial instruments."
"Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments in Hedge Accounting Relationships 
Many transactions constitute economic hedges, and therefore contribute effectively to the securing of 
financial risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9."
"In addition, we occasionally have contracts that contain foreign currency embedded derivatives that 
are required to be accounted for separately."
"Fair value fluctuations in the spot component of such derivatives at FVTPL are included in Other non-
operating income/expense, net while the forward element is shown in Financial income, net."
"Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
a) Cash Flow Hedge 
In general, we apply cash flow hedge accounting to the foreign currency risk of highly probable 
forecasted transactions."
"With regard to foreign currency risk, hedge accounting relates to the spot price 
and to the intrinsic values of the derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges."
"Accordingly, the effective portion of these components determined on a present value basis is 
recorded in other comprehensive income."
"The forward element and time value as well as foreign 
SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-72 
 
currency basis spreads excluded from the hedging relationship are recorded as cost of hedging in a 
separate position in other comprehensive income."
"As the amounts are not material, they are presented 
together with the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in our consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity."
"All other components 
including counterparty credit risk adjustments of the derivative and the ineffective portion are 
immediately recognized in Financial Income, net in profit or loss."
"Amounts accumulated in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss to Other non-operating income/expense, net 
and Financial income, net in the same period when the hedged item affects profit or loss."
"b) Net Investment Hedge 
In general, we do not hedge the foreign currency exposure from the net assets of subsidiaries with a 
functional currency different from the euro, and we do not apply net investment hedge accounting."
"However, in selected cases we might do so, and we applied net investment hedge accounting in 2023."
"For more information, see Note (D.1)."
"The designated component in hedge accounting is the spot price of the derivatives designated and 
qualifying as net investment hedges."
"Accordingly, the effective portion of this component determined 
on a present value basis is recorded in Other comprehensive income."
"All other not-designated 
components or ineffective portions are immediately recognized in Financial Income, net in profit or 
loss."
"Amounts accumulated in Other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss to Other 
non-operating income/expense, net in the same period when the foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold."
"c) Fair Value Hedge  
We apply fair value hedge accounting for certain of our fixed-rate financial liabilities and show the fair 
value fluctuations in Financial income, net."
"d) Valuation and Testing of Effectiveness  
At inception of a designated hedging relationship, we document our risk management strategy and the 
economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument."
"We are exposed to various financial risks, such as market risks (that is, foreign currency exchange rate 
risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk."
"We manage market risks, credit risk, and liquidity risk on a Group-wide basis through our global 
treasury department, global risk management, and global credit management."
"Risk management 
policies are established to identify risks, to set appropriate risk limits, and to monitor risks."
"Risk 
management policies and hedging strategies are laid out in our internal guidelines (for example, 
treasury guideline and other internal guidelines), and are subject to continuous internal review, 
analysis, and update to reflect changes in market conditions and our business."

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Factors 
As we are active worldwide, our ordinary operations are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in 
foreign currencies."
"Since the Group’s entities mainly conduct their operating business in their own 
functional currencies, our risk of exchange rate fluctuations from ongoing ordinary operations is not 
considered significant."
"However, the Group’s entities occasionally generate foreign currency-
denominated receivables, payables, and other monetary items by transacting in a currency other than 
the respective functional currency."
"To mitigate the extent of the associated foreign currency exchange 
rate risk, a significant portion of these transactions is hedged as described below."
"In rare circumstances, transacting in a currency other than the functional currency also leads to 
embedded foreign currency derivatives being separated and measured at fair value through profit or 
loss."
"In addition, the intellectual property (IP) holders in the SAP Group are exposed to risks associated with 
forecasted intercompany cash flows in foreign currencies."
"These cash flows arise out of royalty 
payments from subsidiaries to the respective IP holder."
"The royalties are linked to the subsidiaries’ 
external revenue."
"This arrangement leads to a concentration of the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
with the IP holders, as the royalties are mostly denominated in the subsidiaries’ local currencies, while 
the functional currency of the IP holders with the highest royalty volume is the euro."
"The highest foreign 
currency exchange rate exposure of this kind relates to the currencies of subsidiaries with significant 
operations, for example the U.S."
"dollar, the pound sterling, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and the 
Australian dollar."
"Generally, we are not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk with regard to our 
investing and financing activities, as such activities are normally conducted in the functional currency of 
the investing or borrowing entity."
"Most of the hedging instruments are not 
designated as being in a hedge accounting relationship."
"For all years presented, no previously highly probable transaction designated as a hedged item in a 
foreign currency cash flow hedge relationship ceased to be probable."
"Therefore, we did not 
discontinue any of our cash flow hedge relationships."
"Also, ineffectiveness was either not material or 
non-existent in all years reported."
"Generally, the cash flows of the hedged forecasted transactions are 
expected to occur and to be recognized in profit or loss monthly within a time frame of 12 months from 
the date of the Statement of Financial Position."
"Currency Hedges Designated as Hedging Instruments (Net Investment Hedges) 
We have hedged part of our net investment in our U.S."
subsidiaries which have the U.S.
"dollar as their 
functional currency, by entering into a deal contingent forward."
"The hedged risk is the weakening of the 
U.S."
"The deal contingent forward is designated as a hedging instrument for the 
changes in the value of the net investment that is attributable to changes in the U.S."
subsidiaries due to movements in the spot rate.
"In exceptional cases and 
limited economic environments, operating transactions are denominated in currencies other than 
the functional currency, leading to a foreign currency exchange rate risk for the related monetary 
instruments."
"Where material, this foreign currency exchange rate risk is hedged."
"Therefore, 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates only have an impact on profit with regard to our 
unhedged non-derivative monetary financial instruments and related income or expenses."
"– Our free-standing derivatives designed for hedging foreign currency exchange rate risks almost 
completely balance the changes in the fair values of the hedged item attributable to exchange rate 
movements in the Consolidated Income Statements in the same period."
"As a consequence, the 
hedged items and the hedging instruments are not exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, 
and thereby have no effect on profit."
"dollars, since a large part of our investments are based on variable rates and/or short 
maturities (2023: 53%; 2022: 64%) and most of our financing transactions are based on fixed rates and 
long maturities (2023: 100%; 2022: 87%)."
"Interest Rate Risk Management 
The aim of our interest rate risk management is to reduce profit or loss volatility and optimize our 
interest result by creating a balanced structure of fixed and variable cash flows."
"We therefore manage 
interest rate risks by adding interest-rate-related derivative instruments to a given portfolio of 
investments and debt financing."
"The desired fixed-floating mix of our net debt is set by the Treasury 
Committee."
"Including 
interest rate swaps, 43% (2022: 52%) of our total interest-bearing financial liabilities outstanding as at 
December 31, 2023, had a fixed interest rate."
"Therefore, such interest rate changes do not change 
the carrying amounts of our non-derivative fixed-rate financial liabilities, as we account for them at 
amortized cost."
"Investments in fixed-rate financial assets classified as fair value through profit or 
loss were not material at each year end reported."
"Thus, we do not consider any fixed-rate 
instruments in the equity-related sensitivity calculation."
"– Income or expenses recorded in connection with non-derivative financial instruments with variable 
interest rates are subject to interest rate risk if they are not hedged items in an effective hedge 
relationship."
"Thus, we take into consideration interest rate changes relating to our variable-rate 
financing and our investments in money market instruments in the profit-related sensitivity 
calculation."
"– The designation of interest rate receiver swaps in a fair value hedge relationship leads to interest 
rate changes affecting Financial income, net."
"The fair value movements related to the interest rate 
swaps are not reflected in the sensitivity calculation, as they offset the fixed interest rate payments 
for the bonds and private placements as hedged items."
"However, changes in market interest rates 
affect the amount of interest payments from the interest rate swap."
"As a consequence, we include 
those effects of market interest rates on interest payments in the profit-related sensitivity 
calculation."
"If, on December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, interest rates had been higher/lower this would have had 
the following effects on Financial income, net."

Equity Price Risk 
Equity Price Risk Factors 
We are exposed to equity price risk with regard to our investments in equity securities."
"Equity Price Risk Management 
Our listed equity investments are monitored based on the current market value that is affected by the 
fluctuations in the volatile stock markets worldwide."
"Unlisted equity investments are monitored based 
on detailed financial information provided by the investees."
"The fair value of our listed equity 
investments depends on the equity prices, while the fair value of the unlisted equity investments is 
influenced by various unobservable input factors."
"Equity Price Exposure 
On December 31, 2023, our exposure from our investments in equity securities was €4,967 million 
(2022: €5,137 million; 2021: €5,799 million)."
Most of our equity securities are within the venture-capital-related investment activities.
"For purposes 
of our equity price sensitivity disclosure, we benchmarked the historical average of public market 
returns of the NASDAQ and S&P 500 to the average annual venture capital benchmark returns over a 
12-year period, which is the assumed average holding period of venture capital funds."
"Overall, our 
analysis indicated a blended return range of +/– 22% in 2023."
"Among its stipulations, the guideline requires that we invest 
only in assets from issuers with a minimum rating of at least “BBB flat.” We only invest in issuers with a 
lower rating in exceptional cases."
Such investments were not material in 2023 and 2022.
"The weighted 
average rating of our financial assets is A."
"We pursue a policy of cautious investments characterized by 
predominantly current investments, standard investment instruments, as well as a wide portfolio 
diversification by doing business with a variety of counterparties."
"To further reduce our credit risk, we require collateral for certain investments in the full amount of the 
investment volume, which we would be allowed to make use of in the case of default of the 
counterparty to the investment."
"As such collateral, we only accept bonds with at least investment-
grade rating level."
"In addition, the concentration of credit risk that exists when counterparties are involved in similar 
activities by instrument, sector, or geographic area is further mitigated by diversification of 
counterparties throughout the world and adherence to an internal limit system for each counterparty."
"We 
continuously monitor strict compliance with these counterparty limits."
"For cash at banks, time deposits, and debt securities such as acquired bonds or commercial papers, 
we apply the general impairment approach."
"As it is our policy to only invest in high-quality assets of 
issuers with a minimum rating of at least investment grade so as to minimize the risk of credit losses, 
we use the low credit risk exception."
"Thus, these assets are always allocated to stage 1 of the three-
stage credit loss model and we record a loss allowance for an amount equal to 12-month expected 
credit losses."
"This loss allowance is calculated based on our exposure as at the respective reporting 
date, the loss given default for this exposure, and the credit default swap spread as a measure for the 
probability of default."
"To ensure that during their lifetime our investments always fulfill the requirement 
of being investment-grade, we monitor changes in credit risk by tracking published external credit 
ratings."
"Such financial assets are written off either partially or in full if the likelihood of recovery is considered 
remote, which might be evidenced, for example, by the bankruptcy of a counterparty of such financial 
assets."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-81 
 
Trade Receivables 
The default risk of our trade receivables is managed separately, mainly based on assessing the 
creditworthiness of customers through external ratings and on our past experience with the customers 
concerned."
"Based on this assessment, individual credit limits are established for each customer and 
deviations from such credit limits need to be approved by management."
"We apply the simplified impairment approach using a provision matrix for all trade receivables and 
contract assets to take into account any lifetime expected credit losses already at initial recognition."
"For the purpose of the provision matrix, customers are clustered into different risk classes, mainly 
based on market information such as the country risk assessment of their country of origin."
"Loss rates 
used to reflect lifetime expected credit losses are determined using a roll-rate method based on the 
probability of a receivable progressing through different stages of being overdue and on our actual 
credit loss experience over the past years."
"These loss rates are enhanced by forward-looking 
information to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the 
historical data has been collected, current conditions, and the expected changes in the economic 
conditions over the expected life of the receivables."
"Forward-looking information is based on changes 
in country risk ratings, or fluctuations in credit default swaps of countries of the customers we do 
business with."
"We continuously monitor outstanding receivables locally to assess whether there is 
objective evidence that our trade receivables and contract assets are credit-impaired."
"Evidence that 
trade receivables and contract assets are credit-impaired include, among the trade receivables being 
past due, information about significant financial difficulty of the customer or non-adherence to a 
payment plan."
"Under extreme situations such as the current war situation in Ukraine, related account 
receivables and contract assets are critically assessed to determine whether they are credit-impaired."
"We consider receivables to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations in full, 
However, a delay of payments (for example, more than 90 days past due) in the normal course of 
business alone does not necessarily indicate a customer default."
"We write off account balances either 
partially or in full if we judge that the likelihood of recovery is remote, which might be evidenced, for 
example, when bankruptcy proceedings for a customer are finalized or when all enforcement efforts 
have been exhausted."
"The impact of default on our trade receivables from individual customers is mitigated by our large 
customer base and its distribution across many different industries, company sizes, and countries 
worldwide."
"For more information about our trade receivables, see Note (A.2)."
"There were no loans, or other financial receivables past due but not 
impaired and we had no indications of impairments of such assets that were not past due and not 
impaired as at that date."
"Master Netting and Similar Arrangements 
We enter into derivatives on the basis of the German Master Agreement on Financial Derivatives 
Transactions (“Deutscher Rahmenvertrag für Finanztermingeschäfte”) and similar agreements."
"The 
regulations of these agreements apply particularly in the case of insolvency and not during the normal 
course of business."
"Liquidity Risk Management 
Our liquidity is managed by our global treasury department with the primary aim of maintaining 
liquidity at a level that is adequate to meet our financial obligations."
"Generally, our primary source of liquidity is funds generated from our business operations."
"Our global 
treasury department manages liquidity centrally for all subsidiaries."
"Where possible, we pool their cash 
surplus so that we can use liquidity centrally for our business operations, for subsidiaries’ funding 
requirements, or to invest any net surplus in the market."
"With this strategy, we seek to optimize yields, 
while ensuring liquidity, by investing only with counterparties and issuers of high credit quality, as 
explained before."
"Hence, high levels of liquid assets and marketable securities provide a strategic 
reserve, helping keep SAP flexible, sound, and independent."
"In order to retain high financial flexibility, in 2023, SAP SE entered into a sustainability-linked revolving 
credit facility with a volume of €3.0 billion with an initial term until 2028 plus two one-year extension 
options, replacing its previous credit facility of €2.5 billion from 2017."
"The use of the facility is not 
restricted by any financial covenants."
"Borrowings under the facility bear interest of EURIBOR or the 
agreed benchmark rate for the respective currency plus a base margin which might be adjusted 
depending on the fulfillment of agreed sustainability performance targets."
"We are also required to pay 
a commitment fee of 7bps per annum on the unused available credit."
"We have not drawn on the 
facility."
"In September 2019, we initiated a commercial paper (Commercial Paper, or CP) program."
"As at 
December 31, 2023, we had €0 million of CP outstanding with maturities generally less than six months 
(2022: €930 million)."
"SAP 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F 
 
  
F-84 
 
Additionally, as at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Group had available lines of credit totaling 
€555 million and €555 million, respectively."
"There were immaterial borrowings outstanding under these 
lines of credit in all years presented."
"Liquidity Risk Exposure 
The table below is an analysis of the remaining contractual maturities of all our financial liabilities and 
guarantees held as at December 31, 2023."
"Financial liabilities for which repayment can be requested by the contract partner at any time are 
assigned to the earliest possible period."
"Variable interest payments were calculated using the latest 
relevant interest rate fixed as at December 31, 2023."
"As we generally settle our derivative contracts 
gross, we show the pay and receive legs separately for all our currency and interest rate derivatives, 
whether or not the fair value of the derivative is negative."
"The cash outflows for the currency derivatives 
are translated using the applicable spot rate."
We continue to provide rental guarantees for certain offices used by Qualtrics.
"The amounts shown for 
the financial guarantees are the gross amounts we guarantee, however, we are entitled to 
indemnification payments by Qualtrics which will reduce the guarantee amounts disclosed."
"Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
We use various types of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, which are classified as 
either amortized cost (AC), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)."
"For those financial instruments measured at fair value or for which fair 
value must be disclosed, we have categorized the financial instruments into a three-level fair value 
hierarchy depending on the inputs used to determine fair value and their significance for the valuation 
techniques."

Other Litigation, Claims, and Legal Contingencies 
This Note discloses information about intellectual property-related litigation and claims, tax-related 
litigation other than income tax-related litigation (see Note (C.5)), and anti-bribery matters."
"
 Uncertainty in Context of Legal Matters 
The policies outlined in Note (A.4) for customer-related provisions, which include provisions for 
customer-related litigation cases and claims, equally apply to our other litigation, claims, and legal 
contingencies disclosed in this Note."
The outcome of litigation and claims is intrinsically subject to considerable uncertainty.
"Management’s 
view of these matters may also change in the future."
"Actual outcomes of litigation and claims may differ 
from the assessments made by management in prior periods, which could result in a material impact 
on our business, financial position, profit, cash flows, or reputation."
"The specifics of the jurisdictions where most of the 
claims are located further impair the predictability of the outcome of the cases."
"Therefore, it is typically 
not practicable to reliably estimate the financial effect that these lawsuits and claims would have if 
SAP were to incur expenditure for these cases."
"Further, the expected timing of any resulting outflows of economic benefits from these lawsuits and 
claims is typically uncertain and not estimable, as it depends generally on the duration of the legal 
proceedings and settlement negotiations required to resolve them."
"We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of 
our business, including proceedings and claims that relate to companies we have acquired."
"We will 
continue to vigorously defend against all claims and lawsuits against us."
"The provisions recorded for 
these claims and lawsuits as at December 31, 2023, are neither individually nor in the aggregate 
material to SAP."
"Such intellectual property rights may include patents, copyrights, and other similar rights."
"Contingent liabilities exist from intellectual property-related litigation and claims for which no provision 
has been recognized."
"Generally, it is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of these 
contingent liabilities due to the uncertainties around the litigation and claims, as outlined above."
"Based 
on our past experience, most of the intellectual property-related litigation and claims tend to be either 
dismissed in court or settled out of court for amounts significantly below the originally claimed 
amounts."
"We currently believe that resolving the intellectual property-related claims and lawsuits 
pending as at December 31, 2023, will neither individually nor in the aggregate have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial position, profit, or cash flows."
"Individual cases of intellectual property-related litigation and claims include the following: 
In June 2018, Teradata Corporation, Teradata US, Inc."
"and Teradata Operations, Inc."
"(collectively 
“Teradata”) filed a civil lawsuit against SAP SE, SAP America, Inc., and SAP Labs, LLC in U.S."
"federal court 
in California."
"Teradata alleged that SAP had misappropriated trade secrets of Teradata, had infringed 
Teradata’s copyrights (this claim was subsequently withdrawn by Teradata), and had violated U.S."
Teradata sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.
"In 2019, SAP 
asserted patent infringement counterclaims against Teradata seeking monetary damages and 
injunctive relief."
"In 2020, Teradata initiated a second civil lawsuit against SAP asserting patent 
infringement, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief; in February 2021, SAP filed patent 
infringement counterclaims against Teradata in this second U.S."
"lawsuit as well as a civil lawsuit against 
Teradata in Germany asserting patent infringement, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief."
"Currently, all claims between the parties have been dismissed."
"Teradata has appealed the dismissal of 
its trade secret and antitrust claims; this appeal is expected to be completed by late 2024."
"Tax-Related Litigation 
We are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities."
"In respect of non-income 
taxes, we are involved in various proceedings with only a few foreign tax authorities regarding 
assessments and litigation matters on intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services."
"The 
total potential amount in dispute related to these matters for all applicable years is approximately 
€416 million (2022: €344 million)."
"We have not recorded a provision for these matters, as we believe 
that we will prevail."
