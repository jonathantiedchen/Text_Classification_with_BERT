and vaccines reach the market faster and are accessible to more people worldwide."

Mission
We empower scientists and engineers 
to simplify and accelerate progress 
in life science and bioprocessing, 
enabling the development of new  
and better therapies and more 
affordable medicine."
"Vision
We are a magnet and dynamic platform 
for pioneers and leading experts in our 
field."
"We bring creative minds together 
for a common goal: technological 
breakthroughs that lead to better health 
for more people."
"Bioprocess Solutions 
In the Bioprocess Solutions Division, 
 
Sartorius offers a broad product portfolio 
that covers all steps in the production of 
a biopharmaceutical."
"The company has 
held leading market positions for years 
in its core technologies, such as filtration, 
fermentation, cell cultivation, and fluid 
management."
"The Lab Products & Services Division 
 
of­
fers laboratories in the pharmaceutical 
and biopharmaceutical industries as 
well as at academic research institutes 
innovative solutions for bioanalytics, in 
addition to premium laboratory products, 
consumables, and services."
"Sartorius is 
among the market leaders in laboratory 
balances, pipettes, and lab consumables."
"The entire biopharmaceutical market was characterized by an overall expected normalization of 
demand, in addition to geopolitical tensions, which also affected Sartorius’ business performance."
"In 2023, for the first time in more than a decade, the Group’s sales revenue fell to around 3.4 billion euros."
"That 
was mainly due to the after-effects of the pandemic, in particular the expected, but longer than initially 
anticipated, reduction in customer inventories throughout the life science sector."
"Sales revenue declined year 
over year by 16.6 percent in constant currencies, but increased by around 87 percent compared to 2019, the 
last year before the pandemic."
"In 2023, the Group’s underlying EBITDA margin of just over 28 percent was 
below the high prior-year figure but still at a very respectable level and higher than before the pandemic."
"However, the order situation started picking up at the 
end of the third quarter, and we expect that this trend will gain traction, in particular in the second half of 2024."
"After creating many new jobs at our sites around the world in recent years, we adjusted our headcount to 
around 14,600 by the end of December 2023, in line with our business development."
"The reduction resulted 
primarily from the expiry of fixed-term employment contracts and regular attrition."
"We have also systematically 
reduced costs in other areas and postponed some investments."
"The demand normalization in the biopharmaceutical industry has had an impact on capital market valuations 
in the life science tools sector and therefore on the Sartorius shares price."
"After years of strong increases, the 
Sartorius preference share ended 2023 at a price of 333 euros, which corresponds to a decline of about 10 
percent year over year."
The Sartorius ordinary share closed 21 percent lower at 265 euros.
"To put this into 
perspective: Despite the decline, the market capitalization of Sartorius has increased more than 13 -fold over 
the past ten years."

After four years that were dominated by of significant extraordinary effects, we expect to now enter a phase 
that will be more strongly characterized by fundamental, very positive growth drivers."
"By 2050, the world’s 
population will grow to more than 9.5 billion people, about 1.6 billion of whom will be over the age of 65 and 
have increased need for medical care."
"Novel medications, including above all new approaches in cell and gene 
therapy, have the ability to improve people’s lives and fight diseases that are not yet curable or treatable."
"Innovative technologies are vital in increasing efficiency in the development and production of 
biopharmaceuticals and in making these promising approaches ready to use more swiftly."
"Given these robust 
and positive market trends, our investments in innovative technologies and our strong global footprint, we are 
very well positioned to continue playing a key role in this market in the long term while growing profitably."
"Our broad product portfolio, ranging from bioanalytical instruments and bioreactors to cell culture media and 
reagents, helps our customers manufacture new therapeutics faster and more cost-effectively."
"With key 
technologies for the particularly dynamic segment of cell and gene therapy, we have established a 
comprehensive platform so to bring such highly innovative therapies to the market and thus to patients faster."
"Last year, we added the most important building block to this platform with the acquisition of Polyplus."
"Its 
transfection reagents are key to the efficient production of viral vectors and are used in many of these new 
innovative therapies."
"The first-time issue of bonds with a volume of 3 billion euros to finance the acquisition 
was oversubscribed multiple times and confirms the confidence of the capital markets in the company and its 
strategic course."
"Furthermore, we continued our long-term investment program, for example by expanding our capacities at 
sites in Europe and the United States and starting construction of a new facility in South Korea."
"We have not 
only equipped the production and research infrastructure for further organic growth but have also invested in 
resilience in the face of geopolitical uncertainties, with the aim of continuing to fulfill the highest standards for 
customer delivery and product quality in all regions."
"Based on the recovery in demand and the positive market outlook forecast by industry observers, we 
anticipate that sales revenue will increase by a mid to high single-digit percentage range in 2024."
"The profit 
margin is expected to be a little over 30 percent and the Capex ratio around 13 percent."
"We are working 
intensively on achieving further efficiency gains and ensuring a strong cash flow from operating activities in 
order to rapidly run down the elevated debt leverage following the Polyplus acquisition."
"At the beginning of 
February, we accelerated this deleveraging and created additional strategic flexibility through an equity raise 
totaling 1 billion euros at our French-listed subgroup Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"and, to a lesser extent, at 
Sartorius AG."
"We want to continue our profitable expansion beyond 2024 and plan to keep on growing faster than the 
market."
"For the five-year period to 2028, we aim to achieve an average annual growth rate in the low teens 
range."
"The underlying EBITDA margin is expected to rise further, reaching around 34 percent in 2028."

In addition to our growth targets, we have set ourselves ambitious ecological targets that go far beyond our

"By 2030, we intend to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity by an average of around 10 
percent per year, cut all avoidable direct and indirect emissions from purchased energy to zero, and obtain 100 
percent of our electricity from renewable sources."
"Also, we aim to be climate-neutral by 2045 at the latest."
"Last year’s challenges were different from those during the pandemic, but no less demanding."
"Our employees 
once again did an extraordinary job and went many the extra mile."
"On behalf of the entire Executive Board, I 
would like to thank each and every one of them for their outstanding efforts over the past year."
"Special thanks 
go to the teams who kept up our production and deliveries to our customers in exceptional situations – for 
example at the Beit Haemek site in Israel."
"And we want to particularly thank you, our valued customers, business partners, and shareholders, for the trust

Report of the Supervisory Board 
 
Dear Shareholders and Business Partners, 
2023 was an unusual year for Sartorius."
"It marked the transition from a period dominated by the pandemic (the 
years 2020 to 2022) to an increasing return to normality, which we expect to continue in the current year 2024."
"For the first time in over a decade, we saw a decline in sales revenue in both divisions in the reporting year and 
took adjustment measures in response."
"This made the company’s achievements all the more encouraging: 
Despite the operational challenges, Sartorius completed a strategically important acquisition in the form of 
Polyplus and successfully appointed two successor candidates to the Executive Board."
"The Supervisory Board dealt in detail with the situation and prospects of the company on an ongoing basis 
throughout the year."
"We advised the Executive Board on corporate management and performed the tasks 
assigned by German corporate law and the company’s Articles of Association."
"The 
targets, measures and new reporting requirements in relation to sustainability were also regularly on the 
agenda, along with capital market perceptions of Sartorius and the life science sector as a whole."
"The 
company’s significant transactions were discussed in depth by the respective committees responsible as well 
as by the full Supervisory Board, on the basis of the reports provided by the Executive Board."
"Following 
thorough review of the Executive Board’s reports and proposed resolutions, we voted on these to the extent 
that our vote was required."
"Our cooperation with the Executive Board was always characterized by openness, constructive dialogue and 
trust."
"Focus of the Supervisory Board’s Meetings 
The Supervisory Board held eight meetings in the reporting year, which with a few exceptions were attended 
by all of its members."
"A list of the participants who attended meetings of the Supervisory Board and 
committees can be found on page 15 of this annual report and on the company’s website (LINK)."
"Six of the 
meetings took place face to face and two as videoconferences."
"The Executive Board attended the majority of 
our deliberations."
"Where matters relating to the Executive Board, internal Supervisory Board issues or selected 
special topics were discussed, we met to discuss the relevant agenda items without the participation of the 
Executive Board."
"If required, separate preliminary discussions by shareholder and employee representatives 
took place prior to the deliberations of the whole Board."
"At our meeting on February 10, 2023, we comprehensively discussed the annual and consolidated financial 
statements for fiscal 2022 and endorsed them based on the reports given by the Audit Committee and the 
independent auditors, who were present during this item of the agenda."
"After the independent auditors’ report 
and deliberations were held, we also endorsed the Non-Financial Group Statement for the reporting year."
"After considering the advantages and disadvantages 
of the different Annual General Meeting formats, we also decided together with the Executive Board to hold 
the Sartorius AG Annual General Meeting virtually again."
"In addition to this, our agenda included addressing 
various acquisition opportunities."
"The Supervisory Board approved the Executive Board’s plan to further 
increase Sartorius’ majority stake in the Korean subsidiary Sartorius Korea Biotech."
"Without the participation 
of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board discussed the target achievement of Executive Board members 
in fiscal 2022 and reached a corresponding decision."
"As part of an extraordinary meeting on March 1, 2023, which was held virtually by videoconference, we looked 
at various strategic projects in depth."
"The discussion centered on a possible acquisition of the French 
transfection specialist Polyplus."
"We considered its portfolio, market prospects and potential synergies with the 
two Sartorius divisions in detail."
We also looked at options for financing this potential transaction.
"The acquisition of Polyplus was again among the items on the agenda at our meeting on March 29, 2023."
"After 
a detailed examination, we gave our approval to this transaction and to the arrangement of corresponding 
bridge financing."
"Following a personal introduction and a discussion with Dr. Gatzemeyer, the 
Supervisory Board passed the required resolutions for this purpose."
"Alexandra Gatzemeyer succeeded 
Executive Board member Gerry Mackay as the head of the Lab Products & Services Division."
"For personal 
reasons, he had already announced his intention in 2021 not to stand for a further term of office."
"An extraordinary Executive Board meeting on April 28, 2023, which took place in a virtual format, was held to 
discuss Executive Board matters."
"The Supervisory Board decided here to meet the wishes of the Chief 
Financial Officer, Rainer Lehmann, who wanted to step down at the end of October 2023 to take on a new role 
outside the company."
"To fill this position and ensure a seamless transition, we resolved to begin looking for a 
successor."
"We also approved the stepping down of Gerry Mackay effective June 15, 2023, of which we had 
already been notified."
"At our meeting on July 13, 2023, which included presentations from several managers, we received a 
comprehensive overview of various digitalization initiatives at the company and an update on IT security at 
Sartorius."
"Beyond this, we obtained information on the progress being made with respect to our sustainability 
strategy and programs and upcoming regulatory changes."
"Financing matters were another focus of the 
discussion."
"In this context, following thorough deliberation, we approved the issue of corporate bonds, mainly 
to repay the bridge financing for the Polyplus transaction."
"The Supervisory Board also passed a resolution on the independence of its member Professor Dr. 
Trützschler and on conducting the Supervisory Board self-evaluation by means of a newly designed, 
questionnaire-based online process."
"In an extraordinary meeting on August 3, 2023, we appointed Dr. Florian Funck as Chief Financial Officer 
effective April 1, 2024."
"Prior to the appointment, Dr. Funck introduced himself and discussed various financial 
topics with us."
"We also passed the corresponding resolutions concerning the Executive Board contract and 
remuneration as prepared by the Executive Task Committee."
"At our Supervisory Board meeting on September 14, 2023, we looked in detail at topics relating to the 
corporate strategy, the continued development of the portfolio in both divisions and selected aspects of 
Sartorius’ presence and activities in the various regions of the world."
"Corporate governance topics were on the agenda for the Supervisory Board meeting on December 7, 2023 
and were discussed in detail."
"We adopted the Declaration of Compliance for 2023 and passed a resolution on 
the independence of Dr. Lothar Kappich."
"We also looked at the results of the Supervisory Board self-
evaluation and discussed topics of Executive Board remuneration."
"We concurred with the recommendations 
of the Executive Task Committee concerning the target agreements for the members of the Executive Board 
and approved the related recommendations for resolution."
"In addition, we were given information on 
employee development and retention and received a report on the status of the sustainability strategy and 
programs and on upcoming regulatory changes."
"Another topic was the results of the invitation to tender for 
the auditing of the financial statements starting from fiscal year 2024, which were explained in detail by the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee."
"Following detailed deliberation and on the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, the Supervisory Board decided to propose PricewaterhouseCoopers to the Annual General 
Meeting as the auditors for the Sartorius Group in fiscal year 2024."
"We also approved the budget prepared by 
the Executive Board for 2024, which we had previously discussed in depth."
"Activity Report of the Committees 
Four committees support the work of the Supervisory Board."
"These prepare topics for discussion by the full 
Supervisory Board and, where permissible, make decisions in individual cases instead of the full Supervisory 
Board."
"The committee chairpersons reported regularly to the Supervisory Board on the details of their 
committee work."
"The Executive Task Committee held twelve meetings in the reporting year, of which five took place in person 
and seven virtually."
The number of meetings was higher than average.
"due to the extensive need for 
consultation in connection with appointments to two Executive Board positions, the preparation of Executive 
Board contracts, and remuneration."
"The committee also dealt in depth with succession planning for selected 
functions, corporate governance topics and various strategic measures by the company."
"The Audit Committee held four meetings in the reporting year, all of which were held in person."
"The committee 
prepared for the full Supervisory Board’s resolutions on endorsement and approval of the consolidated annual 
financial statements for fiscal 2022 and discussed the quarterly results and the first-half financial report of 
2023."
"Another focal point was monitoring the effectiveness of the Group-wide risk management and internal 
control system."
"The committee also discussed matters relating to Group financing, IT security and the 
company’s sustainability management."
"Beyond these items, the committee reviewed the Internal Auditing Department report, which did not indicate 
any material discrepancies in business transactions, and also considered the department’s plans for the 
upcoming months."
"Another emphasis of the 
committee’s work in the reporting year was the invitation to tender for the auditing of the financial statements 
starting from fiscal year 2024."
"The Audit Committee was responsible for supporting this process on behalf of 
the Supervisory Board."
"The committee’s chairman in particular was in regular contact with the auditors on 
various issues during, and if necessary outside, the meetings."
The Nomination Committee and Conciliation Committee did not meet in 2023.
"To the extent necessary, the company provides organizational 
support and assumes the costs."
"When new members join the Board, they are provided extensive 
documentation to help them familiarize themselves with their new position, and onboarding meetings are also 
held to familiarize them with the company’s business model and organizational structures."
"Further training measures in the reporting year included participation in specialist events for supervisory board 
members organized by leading auditors and law firms."
"Among other topics, these covered regulatory changes, 
financial and non-financial reporting, takeover law, due-diligence processes and applications for generative 
artificial intelligence."
"Supervisory Board members also actively participated in commissions and networks 
such as the German Supervisory Boards Working Group (AdAR), the Government Commission on the 
German Corporate Governance Code and the foundation Hans-Böckler-Stiftung."

Self-evaluation of Supervisory Board Work 
The Supervisory Board regularly evaluates how effectively the board as a whole and its committees are fulfilling 
their responsibilities."
"Each meeting is followed by a brief assessment of the quality and efficiency of the 
deliberations and of the documents presented."
"A detailed self-evaluation also takes place annually via a 
written survey, which is supported from time to time by external consultants."
"A detailed analysis of 
the efficiency audit is provided to all board members and discussed each year, usually at the December 
meeting."
"Where necessary, appropriate measures are identified."
"This company had been commissioned by the 
Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board pursuant to the resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting 
on March 29, 2023."
The independent auditors issued an unqualified audit certificate.
"The auditors attended the Audit Committee meeting on February 8, 2024, and the Supervisory Board meeting 
on February 9, 2024, and reported on the essential results of their audits."
Sufficient time was allotted for discussion of all issues with the auditors.
"Written information and audit reports 
had been sent to all Supervisory Board members on time and were discussed in detail during the meetings 
mentioned."
The annual financial statements were thus approved.
"The Supervisory Board and the Executive 
Board will submit a proposal at the Annual General Meeting on March 28, 2024 to pay dividends of €0.74 per 
preference share and €0.73 per ordinary share to shareholders from the retained profit."
"Furthermore, the Executive Board submitted a Non-Financial Group Statement based on the German Law to 
Strengthen Companies’ Non-Financial Reporting to implement the EU CSR Directive."
"The content of this 
statement was submitted to a voluntary review by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft based on a 
limited assurance engagement."
"On the basis of this review, KPMG issued an unqualified opinion."
"The auditing 
company attended the Supervisory Board meeting on February 9, 2024, and reported on the results of its audit 
review."
"Following intensive discussions and examination, the Non-Financial Group Statement was also 
endorsed by the Supervisory Board members."

Composition of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board 
The composition of the Supervisory Board did not change in 2023."
"On the Executive Board, Gerry Mackay stepped down effective June 15, 2023, and the Chief Financial Officer, 
Rainer Lehmann, effective October 31, 2023."
"The Supervisory Board thanks them both for their many years of 
very successful work at the company."
"Alexandra Gatzemeyer was recruited to replace Gerry Mackay as head 
of the Lab Products & Services Division effective May 1, 2023."
"Dr. Florian Funck will become the new Chief 
Financial Officer effective April 1, 2024."
"Until then, the Chairman of the Executive Board, Dr. Joachim 
Kreuzburg, will head this board division on an interim basis."
"We would like to express our sincere thanks to the Executive Board and all Sartorius employees worldwide 
for their extremely dedicated and successful work in the past fiscal year."
"We would also like to thank our 
shareholders for the confidence they have once again shown in the company."
"Falling inflation rates and the associated expectations by market players of a reverse in 
interest rates had a positive impact on stock market sentiment."
"economy in particular was 
more robust than originally expected, meaning that a recession was regarded as increasingly unlikely."
"Given 
this backdrop, the Dow Jones ended the reporting year at 37,690 points and up 13.7%."
"The MSCI Europe 
ended the year approximately 11.2% higher at 1,917 points."
"Germany’s benchmark index DAX and the 
technology index TecDAX, which both include Sartorius preference shares, also posted gains of 20.3% to 
16,752 points and 14.3% to 3,337 points, respectively."
"Price of Sartorius Shares Declines 
The performance of Sartorius shares was affected in 2023 by the temporarily dampened growth prospects."
"In 
view of post-pandemic inventory reductions by customers taking longer than expected, a delayed recovery in 
the Bioprocess Solutions division, and weaker development in lab business, the financial forecast had to be 
lowered twice."
"The general market weakness also dampened business development for the other leading 
manufacturers of bioprocess technology and laboratory instruments, meaning that share price development 
for companies in the life science sector was below average compared with the market as a whole."
"Against this 
backdrop, the Sartorius preference share closed the 2023 stock market year at €333.20 – down 9.8% year over 
year."
The ordinary share closed around 20.8% lower at €265.00.
"Sartorius AG preference shares have been listed in the German DAX share index since 2021, and they are also 
included in the TecDAX."
"The preference shares ranked 38th in the DAX and 6th in the TecDAX at year-end 
based on the free-float market capitalization criterion."

"Due to the low free float of Sartorius’ ordinary shares, they are traded only to a limited extent."
"Thus, the average

"The corresponding

"Investor Relations 
Sartorius’ investor relations (IR) activities follow the objective of making the current and future development 
of the company transparent for its shareholders and other interested parties."
"To achieve this objective, 
Sartorius maintains an ongoing, open dialogue with shareholders, potential investors, and financial analysts."
"Aside from providing quarterly, first-half, and annual reports, the company informs the capital market and the 
interested public at quarterly teleconferences and in regularly published press releases about the current 
development of the business and other material events at the company."
"Moreover, Group management and 
the IR team were available to communicate with capital market participants at conferences and road shows."

Implementing the Group’s various strategies and projects at the local level is the responsibility of the national 
affiliates."
"The management bodies of the local companies run their organizations in accordance with the 
applicable statutory provisions, Articles of Association, and rules of procedure, and in keeping with the 
principles of corporate governance that apply throughout the Sartorius Group worldwide."
"Changes in the Group Portfolio 
Sartorius expanded the product portfolio of the Bioprocess Solutions Division in the reporting year by 
acquiring the French company Polyplus through its Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"subgroup, which is listed in 
France."
"The transaction was completed in July 2023 once the required approvals by the authorities had been 
granted."
Polyplus is a provider of innovative cell and gene therapy technologies.
"Established in 2001, the company is 
based in Strasbourg, France, with sites in France, Belgium, the United States, and China, employing around 
270 people."
"The transfection reagents developed and produced by Polyplus are success-critical components 
in the manufacture of viral vectors used in cell and gene therapies as well as other new medical therapy 
methods."
"The company has recently enlarged its focus beyond this field and, through acquisitions in adjacent 
technologies, such as plasmid development and protein and plasmid manufacture, expanded its offering for 
gene therapies and genetically modified cell therapies."
"Moreover, in June 2023, Sartorius – through the Sartorius Stedim Biotech subgroup – acquired Sartonet 
Seperasyon Teknolojileri Anonim Şirketi, which is based in Istanbul, Türkiye."
"The company imports and 
distributes the products of the Sartorius Group in Türkiye and in addition, offers its pharmaceutical customers 
a wide range of services, such as process development, technical support, calibration, and training."
"Sartonet 
had around 40 employees at the acquisition date."
"A key management parameter that Sartorius uses to measure the development of its size is currency-adjusted 
growth of sales revenue, i.e., sales in constant currencies."
"The key indicator for managing profitability is the 
adjusted EBITDA margin, which is based on EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary items, i.e., underlying EBITDA."
"With regard to the Sartorius Group’s debt financing capacity, the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA serves 
as the key metric."
"It is calculated as the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA for the last twelve months, 
including the pro forma amount contributed by acquisitions for this period."
"Furthermore, the CAPEX ratio, i.e., 
capital expenditures in proportion to sales revenue, represents a key control parameter."
"The expected 
Capex ratio, as well as a forecast for the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, is additionally indicated for the 
Group."
"Biopharmaceuticals are integral components of advanced medicine and are used to treat many illnesses, 
mostly of a serious nature."
"However, long development times and complex production make these 
medications very expensive."
"This leads to high healthcare costs in industrialized countries and to the situation 
that patients in less developed countries are often excluded from treatment with such drugs."
"The 
development of a biopharmaceutical medication is a long haul: It takes more than ten years on average to 
bring a new drug out on the market, costing more than two billion euros."
"On top of this, biotechnological 
manufacturing processes for such high-tech medications are demanding and must be developed individually 
for each biologic compound."
"Therefore, the United Nations’ sustainability goal “Good Health and 
Well-Being” is an integral component of Sartorius’ business model."
The maturity and intensity of competition in this comparably young industry are successively increasing.
"To 
support customers in meeting this challenge, Sartorius is constantly developing its portfolio further."
"A key 
competitive advantage is the broad understanding of applications based on its clear focus on the sector."
"The 
company is thoroughly familiar with customers’ value-added chains and understands the interaction of the 
employed systems particularly well."
"A further success factor of the company is that it offers highly 
differentiating technologies."
"The innovative power rests on three pillars: the company´s own specialized 
product development, alliances with partners, and the integration of innovations through acquisitions."
"With the biopharma industry, Sartorius is focusing on an attractive market that is characterized by strong 
growth momentum in view of long-term trends and significant innovative strength."
"Medical progress provides 
positive impetus, leading to the discovery and approval of new biopharmaceuticals."
"The biopharmaceutical 
industry is thus increasingly relying on advanced therapies, such as cell and gene therapeutics and biotech 
tissue products."
"Further primary growth drivers are a growing world population and an increase in age-related 
diseases in industrialized countries."
"In addition, rising incomes in emerging countries are leading to improved 
access to healthcare and rising demand for medications."
"Biosimilars, the generic versions of reference 
biologics that have lost their patent protection, account for a share of the biopharma market that is currently 
still small but especially fast-growing."
"As a result of these factors, the volumes of biotech medications and the 
demand for the appropriate production technologies are steadily increasing, with market growth largely 
independent of business cycles."
"In the following, the positioning and strategy of the company’s two divisions, Bioprocess Solutions and Lab 
Products & Services, are outlined."
"Sartorius also offers data analytics software for modeling and 
optimizing processes of biopharmaceutical development and production."
"In its core technologies, the 
company has leading market positions with high double-digit market shares."
"The breadth of the company’s product portfolio is one of the key factors that differentiates it from many of its 
competitors."
"Sartorius can provide customers with complete process solutions from a single source, as well as 
assist with preceding project planning, process integration, and subsequent validation."
"The company’s 
products are used in the manufacture of all classes of medical drugs, from vaccines and monoclonal antibodies 
to advanced viral vector-based gene therapeutics."
"Recurring business with sterile single-use products accounts for about three-quarters of the division’s sales 
revenue."
"These offer customers cost advantages, flexibility, and less resource usage, and thus a better 
ecological footprint compared with conventional processes employing reusable stainless steel components."
"The high share of recurring revenues is also bolstered by the strict regulatory requirements on the part of the 
customers."
"Because health authorities validate production processes as an integral part of an application for 
approval of a new medical drug, the components initially validated can be replaced only at considerable 
expense once they have been approved."
"Beyond this, the company’s broad and stable customer base that is 
primarily addressed directly through a specialized sales force also contributes to this favorable risk profile."
"The division’s strong strategic positioning and the above-average expansion of the sector are a good 
foundation for profitable growth in the future as well."
"Information on the business development of this division is given in the chapter Business Development of 
Bioprocess Solutions."
"With its products, the division addresses pharmaceutical and biotech research 
laboratories as well as academic research institutes."
"Sartorius supplies scientists and laboratory staff with the 
instruments and consumables they need to make their research and quality control easier and faster."
"For 
example, the company provides life science customers with innovative systems for bioanalytics to enable them 
to automate key analytical steps in the development of molecules, cell lines, and processes: Steps which earlier 
were mostly carried out manually."
"In this way, considerably larger quantities of samples can be examined and 
extensive sets of data generated and evaluated within a short time, substantially accelerating the identification 
of suitable drug candidates or cell clones."
"This contributes to the acceleration of the protracted timelines of 
drug development and increases the efficiency of R&D labs in the biopharmaceutical industry."
"Beyond this, the division offers a wide range of premium laboratory instruments for sample preparation – such 
as laboratory balances, pipettes, and lab water systems – as well as consumables, such as filters and 
microbiological test kits."
"In these product categories, Sartorius has leading market positions and significant 
market shares."
"The company’s solutions are designed to boost the efficiency and productivity of routine yet 
quality-critical lab processes and industry-specific workflows."
"Aside from serving the needs of the 
biopharmaceutical industry, this portfolio is also tailored to quality control labs in the chemical and food 
industries."
"With its innovative technology platforms for bioanalytics and its comprehensive portfolio for sample 
preparation, the Lab Products & Services Division has a strong foundation for further significant organic 
growth."
"Due to economies of scale and product mix effects, growth is projected to be accompanied by a 
continuous increase in profitability."
"Information on the business development of this division in 2023 is provided in the section entitled Business 
Development of the Lab Products & Services Division."

"Administrative functions, support functions, and the Corporate Research unit operate across divisions."
"These targets were raised twice in the 
following years and most recently envisaged sales revenue of around €5.5 billion with an underlying EBITDA 
margin of around 34%."
"Against the backdrop of the weaker than expected market situation in the entire life 
science sector following the pandemic and the resulting temporary decline in sales and earnings, a review of 
the medium-term targets was announced in October 2023."
"The new medium-term ambition until 2028 
communicated at the end of January 2024 replaces the previous planning until 2025."
"Sartorius intends to continue its profitable growth path in the long term and expects to grow faster than the 
market."
"According to the new medium-term targets, the Group plans to achieve average annual sales revenue 
growth in the low-teens percentage range over the five-year period to 2028 of which acquisitions are 
anticipated to contribute around a fifth."
"The underlying EBITDA margin is also expected to increase and reach 
around 34% in 2028."
"The margin targets include expenses of around 1 percent of Group sales revenue for 
measures to reduce the company’s CO2 emission intensity."
"In terms of its two segments, Sartorius expects the Bioprocess Solutions division to grow on average in the 
low- to mid-teens percentage range per year between now and 2028 with an underlying profit margin of 
around 36%."
"The Lab Products & Services division is projected to expand at an average annual rate by a mid to 
high single-digit percentage with a margin of 28% in 2028."
"All forecasts are based on constant currencies, as in the past years."
"Management points out that the industry 
has become increasingly dynamic and volatile in recent years."
"In addition, uncertainties due to the shifting 
geopolitical situation, such as various countries’ nascent decoupling tendencies, are playing an increasing role."
This results in increased uncertainty when forecasting business figures.
"These targets are being implemented by various growth initiatives with the following focal points: 
Expansion of the Product Portfolio 
Sartorius has a broad product portfolio that is aligned with the value chain of the biopharma industry, and that 
the company is continuously expanding."
"The focus is on products that offer solutions for customers’ needs 
and make the company’s offering even more attractive from the customer’s perspective."
"Aside from its own 
research and development activities and strategic partnerships, acquisitions that are complementary to or 
extend the company’s strengths appropriately will remain part of the portfolio strategy of both divisions."
"Due 
to high innovation dynamics, the company considers further additions to be possible on an ongoing basis 
across the entire breadth of the product portfolio."
"Regional Growth Initiatives 
Sartorius continued to expand its production capacity in the reporting year."
"Capital expenditures totaled 
approximately €559.7 million in 2023 and were used to expand sites in Germany, France, Puerto Rico, the USA, 
and South Korea, among other countries."
"Sartorius

North America and Asia are the key focal areas of the regional growth strategy."
"The USA is the world's largest 
market for bioprocess equipment and laboratory products."
"Yet because it is home to the company’s main 
competitors for both company divisions, Sartorius formerly had lower market share in this region than in 
Europe and Asia."
"By systematically strengthening its sales and service capacities, Sartorius has gained market 
share in the USA in recent years."
"In Asia, one focus is on the construction of a new production facility in South Korea, which offers excellent 
growth prospects with its dynamically expanding biopharma market."
A detailed presentation of all investments can be found in the corresponding section starting on page 49.
"Optimization of Work Processes 
Sufficient production capacity and a powerful supply chain are an essential foundation for future growth."
"In 
recent years, Sartorius has substantially expanded its capacities for nearly all product groups at various Group 
sites in order to optimize delivery times and reliably maintain delivery capability, even in the event of local 
transport restrictions."
"Sartorius is driving forward digitalization and automation in many areas to further accelerate and enhance 
processes and, wherever meaningful, to standardize such processes throughout the Group."
"This also includes extending the company’s activities in the areas of e-commerce, digital marketing, and 
analytics, as well as on the topic of IT security."

Macroeconomic Environment and 
Conditions in the Sectors 
  
The Sartorius Group is active in sectors that differ in their dependence on the economy."
"The Bioprocess 
Solutions Division, for instance, operates in an environment that is largely independent of economic 
fluctuations."
"The Lab Products & Services Division, in contrast, is partly active in sectors whose development is 
more strongly affected by economic factors."
"Muted Growth Momentum in the Global Economy  
The growth momentum of the global economy continued to slow further in 2023, although there were 
regional differences in performance."
"The slowdown was more pronounced in industrialized countries, 
particularly the eurozone, than in emerging and developing countries."
"According to estimates by the IMF, 
global gross domestic product rose by 3.0% (2022: + 3.5%) in the reporting period, with industrialized nations 
recording growth of 1.5% (2022: + 2.6%), while the increase in emerging and developing countries was 4.0% 
(2022: + 4.1%)."
"Factors with a dampening effect included cyclical drivers, such as tighter monetary policy, a 
decline in investment activity, and fewer fiscal policy measures to support the economy."
"Structural causes, 
such as increasing geo-economic fragmentation, also had a negative impact on business sentiment and 
trading activity."
"Despite the deteriorating conditions, the labor markets proved generally resilient in 2023, and 
inflationary pressures abated in the course of the year."
"Source: International Monetary Fund 
According to the IMF, the European Union’s economy contracted by 0.7% (2022: + 3.6%)."
"Germany recorded 
a decline of 0.5% (2022: + 1.8%), while France’s economic output was up 1.0% (2022: + 2.5%), and the UK, 
another core European market, expanded by 0.5% (2022: + 4.1%)."

"Conditions in the Sectors 
Sartorius’ key customer groups include the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries as well as public 
research institutions."
"In addition, the company’s customers include quality control laboratories in the chemical 
and food industries."
"Accordingly, the progress of the Group’s business depends on developments in these 
industries."
"Subdued Development of the Biopharmaceutical Market 
After continuous – and in some cases significant – expansion in the global pharmaceutical market in prior years, 
growth stagnated in 2023 according to EvaluatePharma."
"Even revenue generated with biopharmaceuticals, 
which commonly increases faster than that generated by the pharmaceutical market as a whole, remained 
constant at around $436 billion."
"This was primarily due to lower sales of coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics, 
which fell by more than half in the reporting year from the previous level of $100 billion."
"Biopharma’s share of 
the total pharmaceutical market was unchanged at around 39%."
"The leading manufacturers of bioprocess technology recorded declining sales in 2023 and repeatedly lowered 
their growth forecast communicated at the start of the year."
"The influencing factors were of a temporary nature 
and included in particular the sharp decline in Covid-19 -related business and the reduction of elevated 
Sartorius 
Combined Group Management Report    Macroeconomic Environment and Conditions in the Sectors

Start 
 
inventory levels."
"In addition, production levels at some biopharma companies were relatively low, and 
investment activity was generally subdued after several years of intensive capacity expansion."
"Towards the end 
of the third quarter, the order situation recovered for some companies, and a gradual improvement in the 
business situation is expected for 2024."
"The growth of the biopharma market fundamentally depends more on medium- to long-term trends than on 
short-term economic developments."
"Significant impetus here is provided by the globally increasing demand 
for drugs and the approval and market launch of innovative biopharmaceuticals."
"Other growth factors are the 
extension of the range of indications for already approved medications and their further market penetration."
The number of new biopharmaceutical approvals by the U.S.
"Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remained 
high in the year under review, at 42 (2022: 31)."
"The growing significance and acceptance of biologics is reflected not only in their increasing share of sales 
revenue within the global pharmaceutical market but also in the development activities of the pharmaceutical 
industry."
"For example, biopharmaceutical compounds account for around 45% of the R&D pipeline."
"A growing 
number of active substances manufactured using biotech production methods is being approved for the 
treatment of rare illnesses that have been incurable so far."
"In this context, the pharmaceutical industry is 
increasingly focusing on advanced therapies, such as cell and gene therapeutics and biotechnologically 
processed tissue products."
"In 2023, more than 1,600 clinical trials with such treatment approaches were 
conducted, meaning that this area offers significant growth potential over the medium to long term."
"The rising 
number of approved biopharmaceuticals and an increasing variety of therapy types and substance classes, 
coupled with growing demand for medications, are the main drivers for the worldwide increase in production 
capacities for biopharmaceuticals."
"Biosimilars, the generic versions of reference biologics that have lost their patent protection, are also playing 
an increasingly important role in the biotechnology market."
"According to market studies, their sales volume in 
2023 remained modest at an estimated $29 billion, but is expanding at faster rates than the biopharma market 
as a whole."
"The market is expected to continue to grow strongly during the years to come, owing to the 
expiration of several patents for high-selling biopharmaceuticals and an increasing number of new approvals 
of biosimilars and market launches."
"Particularly in the USA, where development has been comparatively slow 
due to regulatory, patent law-related, and marketing hurdles, market penetration is expected to accelerate 
significantly in the next few years."
"A compound annual growth rate of around 15% is expected globally through 
2028."
"Market growth is related, among other things, to the levels of research and development spending in the 
individual end markets, which is partly linked to economic development."
"According to EvaluatePharma, sector-specific research spending increased by 7% to $262 billion 
in 2023."
"The investment focus is on the automation of process workflows and innovative analytical instruments 
that are equipped with enhanced or novel functionalities."
"Products from the field of bioanalytics, for example, 
have above-average growth rates within the laboratory market, and demand in the life science sector is 
generally growing faster than in other industries."
"In view of the above-average growth in previous years, this 
customer segment trended weaker in the reporting year, and the majority of leading suppliers of laboratory 
instruments and consumables recorded declines in sales revenue."
"In addition to the high basis for comparison, 
the reasons cited include restrained investment activity in the current interest rate environment, the 
persistently muted funding environment, especially for small and medium-sized biotech companies, and 
severe market weakness in China."
"Declining demand for Covid-19 test components also had a dampening 
effect."
Research and quality-assurance labs in the chemical and food industry are another customer group.
"This 
segment’s demand for laboratory products depends in part on economic trends."
"Additional momentum can 
also be generated in this sector by regulatory changes, such as stricter requirements for quality control tests 
in the food industry."
"Despite a weaker macroeconomic environment, demand from industrial end markets was 
generally robust in 2023 according to several leading laboratory product manufacturers."
"Academic and public-sector research institutions also use laboratory instruments and consumables 
manufactured by Sartorius."
"Growth in demand is related to such factors as government budgets and funding 
programs, all of which can vary from one country to another."
"In the USA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
is the leading government agency for biomedical research and also the world’s largest research funding 
agency."
"The NIH’s budget has increased steadily over the past ten years, rising again by about 6.5% in the 
reporting year."
The proposed budget for 2024 includes another slight increase.
"The European Union has 
likewise continuously scaled up its research spending in past budget cycles."
"Around €95.5 billion of research 
and innovation funding is to be provided in the period from 2021 to 2027, an increase of 19% compared with 
the previous program."
"Many manufacturers of laboratory products recorded robust demand from academic 
and public research institutions in the reporting year."
"Competitive Position  
The competitive environment of the Bioprocess Solutions Division is characterized by relatively high entry 
barriers arising in part from the biopharmaceutical industry’s strong degree of regulation and its technological 
complexity."
"In this environment, the Bioprocess Solutions Division operates as a total solutions provider, 
covering the core process steps in biopharmaceutical production and preceding process development."
"It has 
leading market positions in key technologies, especially in the areas of bioreactors, filtration, and the 
transportation and storage of liquids."

The Lab Products & Services Division is positioned as a premium provider of laboratory instruments."
"It serves 
both R&D laboratories and quality control laboratories with a focus on the biopharmaceutical industry."
"The 
division’s product range includes laboratory balances, pipettes, and instruments for bioanalytics, as well as a 
wide range of lab consumables."
"The division ranks among the leading providers worldwide in most of these 
areas."
"Major competitors include certain divisions of Danaher Corporation, Merck KGaA, and Thermo Fisher 
Inc."
Among these competitors are also Mettler-Toledo Intl.
"for laboratory balances in particular; Eppendorf 
AG for pipettes; and companies such as Agilent Technologies Inc., Becton Dickinson Co., and PerkinElmer Inc."
"This was more pronounced than anticipated at the 
beginning of the year, and the reduction in customer inventories also lasted longer than expected, which led 
to numerous forecast revisions across the entire life science sector."
"Business development was also impacted 
by a pronounced market weakness in China and the discontinuation of business with Russian customers."
"Against this backdrop, Group sales revenue fell by 16.6% in constant currencies1 to €3,395.7 million; reported 
by -18.7%."
This includes a growth contribution from acquisitions of around 1.5 percentage points2.
"Excluding 
the pandemic-related business, the decline in constant currencies was around 12%."
"The temporarily weaker market environment was also reflected in order intake3, which decreased by 21.5% in 
constant currencies to €3,066.9 million (reported: -23.5%)."
"In line with progress made by customers in 
reducing their inventories, business began to recover at the end of the third quarter, resulting in order intake 
being slightly higher than sales revenue in both divisions and the Group in the fourth quarter."
"For a full comparison of the Group’s business development with its forecast, see page 68."

"In the Bioprocess Solutions division, which offers a wide array of innovative technologies for the 
manufacture of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines, sales revenue decreased by 17.6% in constant currencies to 
€2,678.2 million (reported: -19.5%)."
"This includes about 2 percentage points of non-organic growth from 
acquisitions."
"Excluding the pandemic-related business, the decline was slightly above 12% in constant 
currencies."
"Sales revenue in the Lab Products & Services division, which specializes in life science research and 
pharmaceutical laboratories, stood at €717.5  million, a decline of 12.7% in constant currencies (reported:  
-15.4%) compared to the high level of the prior-year period."

1 Constant currencies: Figures given in constant currencies eliminate the impact of changes in exchange rates by applying the same 
exchange rate for the current and the previous period."
"The EMEA region recorded a decline of 14.4% to 
€1,315.9 million, to which the discontinuation of business with Russian customers contributed around 3 
percentage points."
This region accounted for 39% of total Group sales at the end of the year.
"From a divisional 
perspective, sales in the Bioprocess Solutions division fell more sharply (-16.8%) than in the Lab 
Products & Services division (-4.1%) due to the extraordinary situation following the pandemic described 
above."
"In the Americas region, sales amounted to €1,280.4 million (-14.9%), which corresponds to around 38% of total 
Group revenue."
"The reduction in inventories by customers and the reluctance to invest and purchase were even more 
noticeable in China and led to a significant decline in sales."
"This development also had a significant impact on 
business in the Asia | Pacific region as a whole, which amounted to €799.4 million (-22.1%) and thus accounted 
for a good 23% of total Group revenue."
"Sales in the Bioprocess Solutions division fell by 25.1% and in the Lab 
Products & Services division by 12.4%."
All growth rates for the regional development are in constant currencies unless otherwise stated.
"The respective cost of sales ratio was 
53.8%, compared to 47.8% in the previous year."
"The decline was mainly due to the lower business volume and 
negative product mix effects."
"At €634.4 million, selling and distribution costs were slightly higher than in the previous year (€632.5 million), 
while the ratio of these costs to sales revenue increased year on year to 18.7% (previous year: 15.1%) in 
connection with the decline in sales."
"Research and development expenses fell by 4.7% to €170.8 million in the 
reporting year; the corresponding R&D ratio was 5.0% (previous year: 4.3%)."
"Administrative expenses 
amounted to €214.3 million (previous year: €213.6 million), and the administrative expense ratio was 6.3% in

EBIT fell by 52.7% year on year to €503.9 million; the corresponding margin was 14.8% (previous year: 25.5%)."
"This development was mainly due to the decline in gross profit, which was only partially offset by a reduction 
in operating costs."
"The financial result amounted to - €118.0 million in 2023, compared to €116.9 million in the previous year."
"This 
includes non-cash-effective income of €71.5 million, predominantly from the reporting date valuation of the 
share-based earn-out liability in connection with the acquisition of BIA Separations (previous year: 
€148.9 million)."
"After adjustment for this effect, the increase in remaining net financing expenses resulted, 
among other things, from the increased debt in connection with the most recent acquisitions."
"In the reporting year, tax expenses amounted to €95.9 million (previous year: €268.6 million)."
"In relation to the 
reported earnings before taxes, the tax rate was 24.8% (previous year: 22.7%)."
Net profit for the period fell by 68.2% to €290.0 million (previous year: €913.1 million).
"Net profit attributable to shareholders of Sartorius AG was €205.2 million (-69.7%; previous year: 
€678.1 million)."
"Non-controlling interest stood at €84.9 million (previous year: €235.0 million), which 
essentially reflected shares in Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
not held by the Sartorius Group.
Prior-year figures were restated accordingly.
"More information on extraordinary items is provided on 
page 190."
"Negative product mix effects also had a dampening 
effect, as the reduction in inventories on the customer side particularly affected demand for higher-margin 
consumables and led to a lower share of such products in total sales."
"Price effects on the procurement and 
customer sides largely offset each other."
"1 Underlying EBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and adjusted for extraordinary items."
Underlying EBITDA of the Lab Products & Services division fell by 18.8% to €180.3 million.
"At 25.1%, the 
corresponding margin was moderately below the previous year's figure of 26.2%."
"Relevant Net Profit 
The relevant net profit attributable to the shareholders of Sartorius AG fell by 48.3% to €338.5 million

The R&D ratio of expenses to sales revenue was 5.0% (previous year: 4.3%).
"The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require certain development costs to be capitalized on 
the statement of financial position and then to be amortized over subsequent years."
"In the reporting year, 
capitalized R&D increased to €100.3 million compared with €81.7 million the year before."
"This equates to a 
share of 37.0% (previous year: 31.3%) of the Group’s total R&D expenses."
"Scheduled amortization related to 
capitalized development costs totaled €30.0 million in 2023 (previous year: €23.9 million)."

expertise."
"The Group systematically monitors compliance with these rights on a cost | benefit basis to 
determine which specific individual rights are to be maintained."

261)."
"As a result of these applications, including those of prior years, 435 patents and trademarks during the 
reporting year (previous year: 353) were issued."

Investments 
In the reporting year, Sartorius continued to invest considerably in the expansion of new capacities in all 
regions."
"In addition to significantly expanding production capacities, the investment program aims to further 
diversify the production network and make it more flexible."
"In line with the company’s expansion plans, some 
expansion projects were completed in 2023."
"Further projects will be completed in the current year or in 
subsequent years."
"At €559.7 million, capital expenditures in 2023 were slightly higher than the previous year's figure of 
€522.6 million, as planned."
"The corresponding Capex ratio1 rose to 16.5% (previous year: 12.5%) due to the 
decline in Group sales revenue."
"The company’s largest investment projects in the reporting year included the expansion of membrane 
manufacturing capacities and new laboratory space for product development in Göttingen, Germany."
"At its site in Yauco, Puerto Rico, a production line for cell culture media was set up and put into operation in 
2023."
"Sartorius made further substantial investments in additional clean room space for the manufacture of sterile 
disposables at its site in Aubagne, France, in the reporting year."
"In Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, Sartorius invested in the construction of a new center of excellence in the field 
of bioanalytics, including research laboratories and production capacity."
"In the Asia | Pacific region, the company invested considerably in Songdo, South Korea, where construction 
work began on a plant for cell culture media production and sterile consumables processing."
"In addition, 
Sartorius plans to build a technology center for customer consulting and product demonstrations as well as 
laboratory space at the new site, which is located in the middle of a biopharma park."
Production capacities were also expanded at other locations.

Net Worth and Financial Position 
Cash Flow 
Cash flow from operating activities rose by 16.3% to €853.6 million (previous year: €734.2 million) despite the 
decline in earnings."
The increase resulted primarily from the reduction of working capital.
"While Sartorius had 
increased inventories as planned in 2022 and previous years to secure supply ability in view of the temporary 
tensions in supply chains, these were significantly reduced in 2023."
"In addition, lower tax payments also had a 
positive effect."
"Cash outflows from investing activities decreased slightly by 1.9% to €582.4 million (previous year: 
- €593.8 million)."
"Primarily driven by the placement of bonds with a volume of €3 billion, cash flow from financing activities 
amounted to €2,165.7 million (previous year: €209.9 million)."
"This also included dividend payments for the 
2022 financial year in the amount of €134.4 million (previous year: €118.1 million)."
"This increase is largely due to the rise in non-current assets by 
€2,843.9 million to €7,798.5 million, mainly due to the increase in goodwill, other intangible assets, and 
property, plant, and equipment as a result of the acquisition of Polyplus and by the continuation of the 
investment program."
"At €1,956.9 million, current assets were slightly below the previous year's figure of 
€2,023.2 million, mainly driven by the reduction in trade receivables and a reduction in inventories, which were 
offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents."
"Working capital amounted to €1,387.3 million as of 
December 31, 2023 (previous year: €1,663.5 million)."
2 Sum of inventories and trade receivables less the trade payables.
"Equity grew by €98.5 million to €2,757.4 million."
The equity ratio1 was 28.3% (previous year: 38.1%).
"The Group's non-current liabilities increased from €2,515.5 million to €5,667.9 million in the reporting year due 
to the issue of bonds with a volume of €3 billion."
"In addition to financing the Polyplus acquisition, a smaller 
portion of the funds was used to repay current financial liabilities or was held in cash."
"As a result, current 
liabilities fell by €473.3 million to €1,330.0 million."
The decrease in trade payables also had a positive effect.
1 Equity in relation to the balance sheet total.
"2 Quotient of net debt and underlying EBITDA over the past 12 months, including the pro forma amount contributed by acquisitions  
   for this period."
"Gross debt rose to €5,311.4 million at the end of the 2023 reporting year relative to €2,541.2 million in fiscal 
2022 and is comprised of liabilities to banks, including bonds, promissory note loans (“Schuldscheindarlehen”), 
as well as lease liabilities."
The increase is essentially due to the aforementioned bond placements.
"Net debt, 
defined as gross debt less cash and cash equivalents, increased from €2,375.3 million in the previous year to 
€4,932.1 million."
"It is defined as the quotient of net debt and underlying EBITDA over the past 12 months, including 
the pro forma amount contributed by acquisitions for this period."
"Following the completion of the Polyplus 
acquisition and the investments made in the reporting year, the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA as at 
December 31, 2023, was, as expected, at a higher level of 5.0 (previous year: 1.7)."
"This figure is expected to be 
significantly reduced in 2024, to which a strong expected cash flow as well as the further reduction of 
inventories and lower investments in capacity expansions should contribute."
"The major debt financing 
instruments are shown in the graphic below."
"A major pillar in the financing mix is a syndicated credit line of €800 million with a remaining term until May 
2028 and an extension option."
"In addition, Sartorius has various short-term credit lines totaling around 
€470 million."
"As of December 31, 2023, the total volume of all available and unused credit lines amounted to 
€1,270 million."
"Corporate financing was supplemented in the reporting year by the placement of bonds with a volume of 
€3 billion."
"The issue comprised four tranches with terms of 3 to 12 years and coupons of between 4.25% and 
4.875%."
"The net proceeds from the bond issue were used to repay the bridge financing for the acquisition of 
Polyplus and for general corporate purposes."
"In this context, Sartorius received a credit rating from a rating 
agency for the first time in the reporting year."
"The S&P Global Rating gave Sartorius an investment grade rating 
(BBB)."
"In addition, Sartorius has issued several promissory note loans (""Schuldscheindarlehen"") with a total 
outstanding volume of €1,505 million."
"There are also several short- and long-term loans in place that total 
around €635  million and are being used in part for the expansion of production capacities."
"At around 85%, the majority of the aforementioned financing instruments was concluded at fixed interest 
rates."
The maturity profile of the Group’s financing instruments is broadly diversified.
"Due to its global business activities, Sartorius is exposed to the usual fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, 
which it hedges by forward contracts."
"At the end of 2023, foreign exchange contracts amounted to a volume 
of approximately €625 million, with a market value of €4.9 million."
"In particular, the longer and 
more pronounced than originally expected reduction in customer inventories following the end of the 
pandemic impacted business development and led to lower demand for consumables, such as sterile single-
use bags and filters."
"Other industry-wide factors also had a dampening effect, such as relatively low production 
levels, the largely discontinued business with Russian customers, and an overall muted investment activity on 
the part of customers, primarily in China and the USA."
"Sales revenue fell by 17.6% to €2,678.2 million (reported: 
-19.5%)."
This includes around 2 percentage points of non-organic growth from acquisitions.
"Excluding the 
Covid-19 -related business, the decline stood slightly above 12% in constant currencies."

"In view of the normalization of demand and a high prior-year base due to the pandemic, sales revenue declined 
in all regions."
"In the EMEA region, which accounted for around 39% of the division's sales, revenues fell by 
16.8% to €1,042.2 million compared to the previous year, which was significantly influenced by business with 
vaccine manufacturers."
"In the Americas region, sales amounted to €1,047.8 million (-13.3%) against the 
backdrop of low investment activity by customers in the USA."
The region's share of divisional sales was 39%.
"The Asia-Pacific region, which accounted for 22% of the division's sales, performed significantly weaker due to 
a marked reluctance to invest on the part of pharmaceutical customers, mainly in China."
"At €588.2 million, 
sales were down 25.1% on the previous year."
"(All growth rates for the regional development are in constant 
currencies unless otherwise stated.) 
The temporarily weaker market environment was even more clearly reflected in order intake, which decreased 
by 21.1% to €2,404.1 million (reported: -23.0%)."
"Negative product mix effects also had a dampening effect, 
as the reduction in inventories on the customer side particularly affected demand for higher-margin 
consumables and led to a lower share of such products in total sales."
"Price effects on the procurement and 
customer sides largely offset each other."
"These items predominantly consisted of expenses in 
connection with the most recent acquisitions as well as expenses for various corporate projects and 
structuring measures."

Products and Sales 
The Bioprocess Solutions Division markets products and services for the entire value chain in 
biopharmaceutical production and preceding process development."
"The division’s portfolio includes cell lines, 
cell culture media, bioreactors, a wide range of products for separation, purification, and concentration, and 
products and systems for storage and transportation of intermediate and finished biological products."
"As a result of the acquisition of the French company Polyplus, Sartorius has significantly expanded the product 
portfolio of its Bioprocess Solutions Division in the area of cell and gene therapies."
"Polyplus develops and 
produces high-quality, GMP-compliant transfection as well as DNA and RNA delivery reagents and plasmid 
DNA."
"These components are success-critical in the manufacture of viral vectors used in cell and gene 
therapies as well as other new medical therapy methods."
"The solutions from Polyplus are highly 
complementary to the portfolio created by Sartorius in recent years, which now comprises various cell culture 
media, other critical raw materials, and purification technologies for the development and manufacture of 
advanced therapies."
"In the area of filtration, the Bioprocess Solutions Division introduced a new platform for the large-scale 
manufacture of biopharmaceuticals, which can be preconfigured with a wide range of filter types."
"The platform 
is suitable for a large number of separation steps, from cell culture media to virus depletion to subsequent 
sterile filtration; it is particularly user-friendly in its handling and achieves significant cuts in production times."
"In addition, a high-throughput tool for clarifying and purifying monoclonal antibodies was launched; it helps 
customers speed up the preparation of small cell culture samples for downstream analysis in cell line 
development."
"Moreover, a system was introduced that allows single-use bags to be filled evenly at the same 
time, for example, with cell culture media for the manufacture of cell therapies, thus accelerating the filling 
process significantly."
"Sales Activities  
The Bioprocess Solutions Division markets most of its product portfolio directly."
"Sales activities for key 
accounts are coordinated and supported by global key account management."
"Communication with customers via on-site visits is now supplemented by digital channels: Many contacts with 
customers are made through digital communication tools."
"Videoconferencing and augmented reality are 
used for such direct interactions, for example, when demonstrating products, conducting training sessions,

and bringing systems into service."
"Another focus aimed at strengthening the sales force is on expanding the 
company’s international presence and on continually enhancing sales efficiency, for example, with product 
and application training or further specialized training for employees."
"Additional focal areas comprise developments in materials and components that include 
plastics, elastomers, and intelligent polymers; expanded data analysis; cell line development; and critical media 
components for protein-based, viral, and so-called advanced therapies."
"Product development is aimed at expanding the existing portfolio on a complementary basis and further 
enhancing the range of integrated complete solutions for the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals – from the 
early phase of development to commercial production."
"The largest product development site is located in Göttingen, Germany, where a new product development

United States, and the UK, as well as in Sweden, Israel, Slovenia, and other locations in Germany."
"Production and Supply Chain Management 
The Bioprocess Solutions Division has a very well developed global production network that was expanded at 
several sites in the reporting year."
"The largest production facilities are located in Germany, France, and Puerto 
Rico."
"Beyond these locations, this division also manufactures in the UK., Switzerland, Tunisia, India, the United 
States, China, Israel, and Slovenia."
"The most recent acquisition has added sites in France, Belgium, the United 
States, and China."
"In the reporting year, Sartorius expanded its plant in Puerto Rico by adding a production facility for cell culture 
media."
"The new facility allows the company to supply, from its plant in Yauco, high-quality cell culture media 
in powder form, which are used in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins and other modalities."
"Production 
in Yauco is focused on customers in the Americas region."
"Moreover, construction started in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, on a center of excellence for the 
development and production of quality-critical reagents for the cell and gene therapy market."
"The new 
building will increase the existing production of cytokines and growth factors and significantly expand research 
and development."
"The building is scheduled for completion in 2025, and production is expected to start in 
2026."
The supply chain situation continued to ease in 2023 compared with previous years.
"Delivery times for most 
products have normalized, and the availability of electronic components and some chemical raw materials also 
improved over the course of the year."
"Excluding the pandemic-related 
business, which in the laboratory division primarily comprised membranes for Covid-19 test kits and pipette 
consumables, sales revenue would have declined by slightly below 11% in constant currencies."
"After business 
with bioanalytical instruments for pharmaceutical applications in particular had expanded significantly in 
previous years, a marked reluctance to invest on the part of this customer group led to a drop in sales in the 
reporting year."
"This affected both larger customers and smaller biotech companies, for whom the funding 
environment had deteriorated significantly compared to the pandemic years."

"Following the strong development in the previous year, sales in the Americas region fell by 21.1% to 
€232.6 million, so that this region accounted for 32% of the division’s sales."
"In particular, demand for 
bioanalytical instruments was weaker following the high growth rates of previous years."
"Sales in the EMEA 
region, which accounted for around 38% of the division’s sales, declined moderately by 4.1% to €273.7 million."
"The Asia | Pacific region, which contributed 30% to the Lab Products & Services division's business, decreased 
by 12.4% to €211.2 million, primarily due to a significant drop in sales in China."
"At 25.1%, 
the corresponding margin stood only slightly below the level of the prior-year period (26.2%)."
"Price effects on 
the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other."
"These items resulted primarily from expenses for various corporate 
projects and structuring measures."
"In the area of bioanalytics, the division offers life science customers innovative systems for cell analysis."
"These 
greatly accelerate the otherwise time-intensive discovery of medical drug candidates by automating and 
digitalizing core steps in analysis."
"Automated analysis, selection, and isolation of cells enable customers, 
moreover, to significantly reduce time to result as well as cost in cell line development and antibody discovery."
"In addition, the product range of the Lab Products & Services Division includes a broad array of premium 
laboratory instruments for sample preparation, such as laboratory balances and lab water systems, as well as 
lab consumables, such as filters and microbiological test kits."
"This Sartorius portfolio is tailored to the 
biopharmaceutical industry and additionally focuses on research and quality control labs in areas such as the 
chemical and food industries."
"In the area of bioanalytics, the division launched a new software module for a live cell imaging system in the 
reporting year, which allows customers to process data in accordance with the FDA’s rules for electronic 
records and signatures."
"By cooperating with an industry partner in the area of proteins, the division in July 
expanded its fast-growing portfolio for stem cell and organoid research by adding animal-free growth factors 
and cytokines, with the aim of enabling rapid progress in the discovery of new cell models."
"Another product brought to market was a new version of an electronic pipette, which allows data to be 
recorded in real time and enables integration with other equipment, thereby improving productivity and data 
quality."
"A new premium laboratory balance was also introduced, which offers customers improved adaptability 
to ambient factors, such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure; intuitive cleaning processes; 
and flexible hardware upgrades."
"The services offered by the Lab Products & Services Division cover the entire life cycle of laboratory 
instruments, from device installation and commissioning to validation, calibration, verification, and regular 
maintenance to repair."
"These services are not limited to Sartorius instruments alone; they are offered to a 
partial extent for devices from other manufacturers as well."
"This extensive range enables customers to 
minimize the number of service providers they use and to reduce complexity and costs."
"Sartorius

Beyond this, Sartorius application laboratories in all regions offer customers the opportunity to test Sartorius 
products, even using their own samples, and to take training courses."
"Sales Activities 
The division mostly distributes its bioanalytics offering directly, while standard instruments and consumables 
are also offered through laboratory distributors."
"The focus is on further expanding the direct channels, 
including online business with customers in the life science industry."
"In aligning its activities, the division is 
increasingly using digital channels."
"Aside from extending sales structures, the company also concentrates on the ongoing enhancement of sales 
efficiency, in part through the creation of synergies between the two divisions."
"This gives the Lab 
Products & Services Division access to customers of the Bioprocess Solutions Division, which in turn can also 
open up new sales opportunities."
"Product Development 
The division has extensive technological expertise in the areas of bioanalytics, laboratory instruments, and 
laboratory consumables."
"Software and hardware advancements in the company’s cell analysis products create 
many new evaluation opportunities for our customers."
"They are the foundation for the development of new 
tools capable of processing and visualizing vast quantities of data appropriately based on specific applications."
Compliance with regulatory requirements is critical for the company’s customers.
"Product development 
priorities for Sartorius therefore include data management, connectivity, and process automation."
"Most of the research and development for the Lab Products & Services Division is conducted at Group 
headquarters in Göttingen, Germany, where a new product development building opened in the reporting 
year."
"Sartorius also carries out R&D activities at its sites in the USA, Finland, the UK, India, and China."
"Production and Supply Chain Management 
The Lab Products & Services Division operates plants in Germany, China, Finland, the UK, and the USA."
"These 
plants serve as centers of competence and tend to focus on one product group or a small set of product 
groups."
"In 2023, for example, laboratory balances were manufactured in Germany and China, pipettes in 
Finland, and bioanalytical systems in the USA and China."
"Microbiological test kits are produced in the UK, and 
most membrane-based products in Germany."
"Capacity expansions at the site in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, progressed as scheduled in 2023."
"Measuring 
12,000 square meters, this ultra-modern facility is intended to meet growing demand for the division’s 
products and services and combine different functions, such as the operational area for bioanalytical devices, 
customer and repair service, and product development."
Completion is scheduled for 2024.
The supply chain situation continued to ease in 2023 compared with previous years.
"The availability of 
electronic components continued to pose a challenge, but improved over the course of the year."
"This was more pronounced than anticipated at the beginning of 
the year, and the reduction in customer inventories also lasted longer than expected, which led to numerous 
forecast revisions across the entire life science sector."
"Business development was also impacted by a 
pronounced market weakness in China and the discontinuation of business with Russian customers."
"Against 
this backdrop, the company management lowered its growth and earnings forecast for both divisions and the 
Group in June and October 2023."
"In line with progress made by customers in reducing their inventories, 
business began to recover at the end of the third quarter, so that order intake was slightly above sales revenue 
in the fourth quarter."
The company management therefore expects profitable growth for 2024.
"Group sales revenue decreased by 16.6% in constant currencies to €3,395.7 million in 2023."
"The Group’s 
earnings margin, measured on the basis of underlying EBITDA, stood at 28.3%."
"The forecast given in October 
for a decline in sales revenue of around 17% with profitability of just over 28% was therefore achieved."
"In the Bioprocess Solutions division, sales revenue fell by 17.6% in constant currencies to €2,678.2 million and 
achieved an underlying EBITDA margin of 29.2%."
"The results were therefore in line with the October guidance, 
which forecasted a decline in sales of around 18% with an earnings margin of just over 29%."
"With a decline in sales revenue of 12.7% in constant currencies to €717.5 million and an earnings margin of 
25.1%, business development in the laboratory division was also in line with the latest forecast."
"Accordingly, a 
drop in sales of around 13% and an underlying EBITDA margin of just over 25% had been expected."
"The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA rose to 5.0 in the reporting year, mainly due to the financing of the 
Polyplus acquisition, and corresponded to the forecast value of slightly above 5."
"In line with its ambitious medium-term growth targets, Sartorius further expanded its production capacities in 
the reporting year, with the ratio of capital expenditures (Capex) to sales revenue reaching 16.5%; the forecast 
was for a figure of slightly above 17%."
2 Possible acquisitions are not considered.
"In this context, the reported retained profit is 
used to determine the dividend payment to our shareholders."
The Management Report of Sartorius AG and the Group Management Report for fiscal 2023 are combined.
"The annual financial statements of Sartorius AG prepared according to the HGB and the combined 
management report are published simultaneously in the German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger)."
"of the combined management report of 
Sartorius AG and the Group."
"Earnings Situation 
Sales revenue of Sartorius AG essentially consists of cost transfers to affiliated companies within the Group for 
management services rendered as well as of the rental of buildings on the Sartorius Campus and in the 
Sartorius Quarter."
Other operating income in the previous year included book profits from asset disposals totaling €67.3 million.
These resulted from the transfer of shares in Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A.
"to the sellers of BIA Separations as 
part of the transaction structure agreed upon in 2020."
"Income from investments of €97.7 million relative to €85.5 million in the previous year concerns dividends paid 
out for the French subsidiary Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"Due to profit and loss transfer agreements, Sartorius AG received a profit of €15.8 million from Sartorius 
Corporate Administration GmbH (previous year: €11.9 million)."
"In addition, Sartorius Lab Holding GmbH 
transferred a profit of €45.0 million (previous year: €7.6 million)."
"The increase in interest expenses of Sartorius AG in comparison with the previous year is partly explained by a 
note loan (“Schuldscheindarlehen”) in the amount of €650 million taken out in November 2022."
"Since parts 
of this note loan were not disbursed until 2023, it was only fully reflected in interest expenses for 2023."
"Interest 
expenses were also driven by the bridge financing taken out during 2023 to fund the Polyplus acquisition in 
the amount of €2.45 billion, which has been replaced by the bonds issued by Sartorius Finance B.V."
"Sartorius

Given that some loans are taken out at variable interest rates, a year-on-year increase in interest rate levels 
also led to an increase in interest expenses at Sartorius AG."
"Net Worth and Financial Position 
The balance sheet total of Sartorius AG fell by €235.2 million in the reporting year to €2,638.9 million."
"The balance sheet structure of Sartorius AG reflects its function as the management holding entity for the 
Sartorius Group."
"Fixed assets consist primarily of financial assets and, in the reporting year, stood at 
€2,234.2 million (previous year: €2,748.4 million)."
"Accordingly, fixed assets accounted for 84.7% of the balance 
sheet total (previous year: 95.6%)."
"The equity ratio stood at 16.0%, compared with 14.1% in the previous year."
Sartorius AG uses internal Group loans to ensure the financing of the majority of Group companies.
"Long-term 
loans are reported under financial assets as loans to affiliated companies, which totaled €1,653.5 million in the 
fiscal year (previous year: €2,158.9 million)."

"Risks and Opportunities 
The opportunities and risks affecting the business development of Sartorius AG as the management holding 
entity are essentially equivalent to those of the Sartorius Group."
"Sartorius AG shares in the risks to which its 
investments and subsidiaries are exposed in proportion to the extent of its investment."
"For all identifiable risks 
to Sartorius AG that could have a negative impact on its net assets, financial position, and results of operations, 
countermeasures were taken and/or balance sheet provisions formed in the reporting year, insofar as this was 
reasonable and possible."
"A detailed Opportunity and Risk Report for the Sartorius Group is provided on pages 73 to 85 and a description 
of the internal control and risk management system on page 91."
"Forecast Report 
Earnings trends for Sartorius AG depend substantially on the performance of its subsidiaries and, as such, on 
the Sartorius Group."
"With respect to the individual financial statements of Sartorius AG, the significantly lower dividends expected 
from Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
are reflected in a significantly lower expected annual profit.
The Sartorius Group’s business performance is discussed in the Forecast Report on pages 86 to 89.
"Material Events after the Reporting Date 
On February 7, 2024, Sartorius AG completed the placement of 613,497 preference shares held by the 
company excluding the subscription rights of existing shareholders."
"The preference shares were placed at a 
price of €326.00 per share."
Gross proceeds amount to approximately €200 million.
"The placement 
preference shares were issued exclusively to institutional investors in the course of a private placement 
through an accelerated bookbuilding process and will be fully entitled to dividends from January 1, 2023."
"The net proceeds from the placement of treasury shares will accelerate the deleveraging of Sartorius Group 
beyond a strong operating cash flow as well as strengthen the strategic flexibility of the company as a whole."
"Independent of the above, Sartorius’ French listed subgroup Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"also carried out a 
capital increase on February 7, 2024, where 5,150,215 new shares with a volume of approximately €1.2 billion 
were placed in the course of an accelerated bookbuilding process."
"The Sartorius AG has participated in this 
capital increase by acquiring 1,716,739 new SSB shares with a total volume of approximately €400 million at a 
placement price of €233.00."
"After completion of the capital increase Sartorius AG’s stake in Sartorius Stedim 
Biotech S.A."
will amount to approximately 71.5 % of the share capital.
"Taking these measures into account, the Group anticipates a reduction of net debt by around €1 billion."
No other material events occurred up to the end of the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
"Sartorius 
Combined Group Management Report    Opportunity and Risk Report

Start 
 
Opportunity and Risk Report  
Principles 
Every business activity entails opportunities and risks that have to be managed."
"The skill with which this is done is a decisive success factor in determining the future development of a 
company's shareholder value."
"The point of risk management is not to always eliminate every risk possible; rather, Sartorius’ approach is to 
intentionally take a certain measure of risk in its business activities in order to be successful in unlocking 
opportunities."
"In this endeavor, it is important to keep risks contained within acceptable limits and to control 
them carefully."
"Through appropriate guidelines, the company ensures that risk assessments are taken into 
account in the decision-making processes from the very beginning."
"At Sartorius, identification and management of opportunities and risks is a cross-functional component of 
Group management."
"To this extent, the risk management organization reflects a global functional organization 
in the two divisions of Bioprocess Solutions; and Lab Products & Services, and in the supporting functions as 
well."
"Individuals heading a functional area of the Group companies are each responsible for their own 
management of opportunities and risks."
"In addition, the Finance department assumes responsibility for central 
risk management and is responsible for regular reporting and the further development of the risk management 
system as a whole."
"Managing Opportunities 
Opportunity management centers on the analysis of target markets and sector environments, as well as the 
assessment of trends, both of which give strong indications as to future business opportunities."
"One of the key 
roles of the relevant managers is to identify potential for development, which initially takes place at the local 
rather than the central level."
"Particularly the market-facing functions, such as strategic marketing and product 
management in each of the two divisions, play a leading role in this respect."
"These areas are supported by the 
central Business Development unit, which is responsible for market monitoring, data analysis, and the 
implementation of strategic projects."
"As a partner to the biopharmaceutical and laboratory industries, Sartorius operates in future-oriented and 
high-growth sectors."
"The significant opportunities generated by the various market and technology trends are 
described in detail in the sections entitled “Conditions in the Sectors” and “Outlook for the Sectors” on pages 
35 and 87, respectively."
"The company´s own assessments rank Sartorius as one of the global market leaders in many subsegments and 
product areas."
"Based on its quality products, high degree of brand awareness, and established customer 
relationships, the company has excellent opportunities to stabilize and further expand its leading market 
position."
"The corresponding divisional strategies, as well as growth opportunities and initiatives based on these 
strategies, are outlined in the sections “Strategy of the Bioprocess Solutions Division” on page 29 and 
“Strategy of the Lab Products & Services Division” on page 30."
"Sartorius 
Combined Group Management Report    Opportunity and Risk Report

Risk Management 
Organization 
Overall responsibility for an effective risk management system lies with the Executive Board."
"The Supervisory Board of Sartorius AG monitors the effectiveness of the risk management system, with the 
preparatory work being performed by the Audit Committee of this board."
"While carrying out their statutory 
audit mandate for the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, the independent 
auditors assess whether the early warning system in place is capable of prompt identification of risks that could 
jeopardize the future of the company."
"Finally, the Internal Audit department regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of the risk management system."
"The key results of these audits are discussed by the Executive 
Board, Supervisory Board, and Audit Committee."
"Any adjustments to the risk management system are then 
implemented by the central risk management team."
"Insurance 
To the extent possible and financially reasonable, Sartorius has taken out insurance policies to cover a large 
number of risks."
"Among other risks, these insurance policies include coverage against risks relating to product 
liability, property damage, business interruption, cybersecurity, transport, and material and pecuniary 
damages, and provide comprehensive coverage for legal costs."
"An independent department working in 
conjunction with an external insurance broker regularly reviews the nature and extent of the insurance 
protection and makes any adjustments as necessary."
"When choosing insurers, the company particularly considers the credit rating of these entities as potential 
contractual partners and aims to achieve a high degree of diversity in order to mitigate the related risks."
"This Handbook is based on the ISO 31000 ""Risk management – Guidelines"" standard and the COSO standard 
(COSO = Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission)."
"There are also a number of 
other sources that contain stipulations for handling risks, including the Articles of Association and rules of 
procedure of the Group companies and other guidelines."
"The Group’s dynamic performance over the past few 
years as well as increasing regulatory and customer requirements necessitate the ongoing refinement of these 
guidelines and specifications."
"The reporting process in the risk categories described below establishes the rules for the ongoing review and 
reporting of information regarding risk situations."
"If any specific risks are discernible, these are documented 
with respect to their assessment, probability of occurrence, and measures to be taken to eliminate such risks 
or to mitigate their impact."
"In addition, as soon as these risks reach defined size criteria, they are reported to 
the central risk management system."
"As a matter of policy, assessment of risks is governed by the remaining 
net risk, i.e., taking any risk-mitigating measures into account."
"The central risk management system aggregates 
Sartorius 
Combined Group Management Report    Opportunity and Risk Report 
 
75 
 
 
Start 
 
the risk reports and provides regular reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board on the risk 
situation of the Group."
"This reporting also includes a comparison of the risk portfolio with the Group’s risk-
bearing capacity as determined on the basis of rolling liquidity planning."
"An urgent reporting procedure is in 
place to ensure that the Executive Board of Sartorius AG receives all of the necessary details without delay 
when a new or emerging significant risk to the Group’s net worth, financial position, and/or profitability is 
identified."
"In order to provide a logical structure for the individual risks, Sartorius has defined four main risk categories: 
external risks, operating risks, financial risks, and compliance risks."
"Each main category is divided into several 
subcategories that are described in the following sections."
"As one of the leading bioprocess technology providers, the Group was able to help manage the 
pandemic by supplying products used in the manufacture of coronavirus vaccines and test components and 
achieved significant growth in sales revenue in 2021 and 2022."
"In 2023, the running down of stocks by many 
customers combined with the significant reduction in coronavirus-related business led to a double-digit 
decline in orders and sales revenue."
"Since the beginning of Russia's attack on Ukraine, Sartorius has suspended all business activities in Russia that 
are not related to humanitarian medical products."
"Sales generated in Russia have subsequently fallen 
Sartorius 
Combined Group Management Report    Opportunity and Risk Report

Start 
 
significantly with moderate impacts on the Group."
"The Group has taken a wide range of measures to tackle 
the war’s indirect effects, such as inflation, disrupted supply chains, and potential gas and energy shortages."
Price increases were agreed on the customer side to compensate for the rise in procurement costs.
"The 
Group's German sites have largely succeeded in making themselves independent of Russian gas supplies, for 
instance by creating the technical conditions necessary in order to switch to oil."
"Safety stocks from suppliers 
with energy-intensive production processes were increased."
"Overall, the direct and indirect effects of the war in Ukraine on the Group’s future business performance are 
not considered material."
"As the war is ongoing and it is impossible to reliably assess the further development 
of the conflict as well as its indirect effects, this situation remains subject to a high degree of uncertainty."
Sartorius operates a production facility for cell culture media in Beit Haemek in northern Israel.
"While most of 
the hostilities since the attack by Hamas have been concentrated on the Gaza Strip, southern Israel, and the 
Tel Aviv area, the situation in the northern border region also remains tense."
"Production at the site, transport, 
and logistics have so far been maintained."
"A further escalation of the conflict in Israel or the wider region 
could lead to temporary production stoppages."
"To strengthen resilience and safeguard the reliability of 
deliveries, the Group is working to build backup capacity for products that are currently only manufactured 
at this location."
"The overall business volume of products manufactured in Israel is noncritical for the Group 
(<1% of the Group’s total sales revenue)."
"Alongside the conflicts mentioned above, other events such as natural disasters may impact the Group’s 
business activities."
"The largest sites in Germany and France do not face any major risks in this regard, while the 
production plants in Puerto Rico and in Fremont, California, are exposed to the risks of severe hurricanes or 
earthquakes and could be impacted accordingly."
A wide range of products for the U.S.
"market are produced 
particularly at the Puerto Rico production plant, meaning that large-scale damage here could have 
considerable impact on consolidated earnings."
"To mitigate the associated risks, Sartorius applies the highest 
possible safety standards when constructing buildings and explicitly takes potential risk scenarios into account 
when defining strategies with regard to warehousing and the international production network."
"Since the Group companies operate globally and have international interdependencies, punitive tariffs and 
trade conflicts can have negative effects on the Group’s business activities."
"To reduce any possible impacts, 
various measures are currently being reviewed, such as an extension of our supplier network."
"The political 
developments in some countries, such as China, could in future lead to decoupling tendencies or restrictions 
on the business activities of foreign enterprises."
"Owing to the concentration of its business activities in the life science sector, the effect of general economic 
developments on Sartorius is lower than average."
"The Lab Products & Services Division is susceptible to 
business cycles in certain areas that can pose a risk to its growth."
"This division’s increasing focus on the 
biopharma sector, however, significantly reduces these risks."
"Overall, the relevance of geopolitical risks to the Group’s business activities has increased significantly in 
recent years and resulted in greater volatility of the Group’s business results."
"The Group monitors 
developments in this regard and, where possible, initiates risk mitigation measures at an early stage."
"Operating Risks and Opportunities 
At Sartorius, value creation extends from procurement through production to distribution."
"Problems within 
this workflow can have consequential effects, including canceled or delayed deliveries."
"The Group’s supply 
chain management system ensures that all of the processes along the entire value chain are analyzed and 
managed in order to largely minimize the risks in this context."
"On the other hand, the Group’s high level of 
Sartorius

77 
 
 
Start 
 
internationalization, for example, unlocks a number of opportunities."
"The individual risks and opportunities 
within the value chain are presented in detail below."
"Procurement Risks and Opportunities 
Sartorius purchases a wide range of raw materials, components, parts, and services from suppliers and is 
consequently exposed to the risks of unexpected delivery bottlenecks and/or price increases."
"The global 
economic environment resulted in price increases in virtually every area in 2022 and 2023."
"Price effects on the 
procurement and customer sides largely offset each other, meaning that inflation had no material negative 
impact on profitability."
"In the field of supplier management, powerful tools and robust processes have been implemented in recent 
years to manage risks and ensure supply continuity."
"Important measures to reduce potential supply 
bottlenecks include maintaining safety stock levels and identifying alternative materials or suppliers."
"From the 
Group perspective, there is no material dependency on individual suppliers."
"In addition, the Group regularly 
conducts supplier audits and carefully monitors the delivery status and inventory levels of critical raw materials."
"Sartorius actively manages procurement risks due to a possible shortage of raw materials or components on 
the market."
"By concluding binding purchase agreements with suppliers and/or seeking alternatives within the 
supplier network, Sartorius can reduce their impact and largely secure continuous supply."
"In 2023, the Group 
saw a normalization of global supply chains in many areas following the supply shortages for raw materials and 
components that had resulted from the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine."
"In addition, Sartorius evaluates its supplier base in accordance with legal requirements – for example under 
Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act – and with regard to compliance with internal and external 
sustainability standards."
"In the event of deviations, the process provides for a variety of measures that are 
coordinated with the suppliers in question."
"Production Risks and Opportunities 
Sartorius manufactures a significant share of its products in-house with a high degree of vertical integration, 
for example filters and laboratory balances."
"For other products, such as bioreactors, the Group works with 
suppliers, which means that some of the production risks can be shifted to external third parties."
"Where 
Sartorius manufactures products itself, the Group also bears the associated risks of capacity bottlenecks or 
overcapacity, production downtimes, excessive reject rates, and high levels of tied-up working capital, as well 
as dependency on individual manufacturing sites."
"Careful planning of production capacities using versatile machines and semi-automated individual 
workstations, in conjunction with flextime work schedules and continuous monitoring of production 
processes, can limit these risks."
"Moreover, Sartorius’ global manufacturing network enables the Group to 
compensate for any capacity bottlenecks by shifting production to other regional plants as well as to limit the 
Group’s dependency on individual local manufacturing sites."
"High volatility in demand, such as that seen since 
the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, may nevertheless lead to over- or underuse of production 
capacity with corresponding positive or negative impacts on productivity."
Highly flammable or explosive substances are used in some production areas.
"The improper handling of such 
materials can result in significant damage to property and business interruptions."
"The Group has taken all 
necessary organizational and structural measures at the affected locations to mitigate this risk as much as 
possible."
"In 
addition, this approach ensures that international production sites can concentrate on specific manufacturing 
technologies, leveraging regional cost advantages as a result."
"Continuous improvements in manufacturing, 
such as the simplification of processes, as well as increased automation and digitalization, also help to further 
increase efficiency."
"Sales and Distribution Risks and Opportunities 
The Group uses a variety of channels to sell and distribute products around the world."
"Possible risks include 
unexpected changes in the demand structure, for example, due to consolidations in the markets served by 
Sartorius, increasing price pressure, or failure to comply with supply agreements entered into with customers."
"The funding environment for small biotech companies has deteriorated since the end of the pandemic, 
resulting in lower demand from this customer group in both divisions."
"Should this trend continue, it could 
affect the Group’s growth forecasts."
"The fall in demand with the decline in Covid-19 -related additional 
business and the reductions in inventory levels previously raised by customers are likely to affect the industry’s 
performance only temporarily."
"The Group regards the fundamental growth drivers as intact and expects 
profitable growth again in the coming years (see the sections entitled “Conditions in the Sectors” and “Outlook 
for the Sectors” on pages 37 and 87 and the Forecast Report in the next section, p."
"Sartorius uses targeted market analyses to try to identify trends in demand in individual submarkets at an early 
stage so that it can react accordingly."
"Technical innovations and the fact that a large number of our products 
are used in validated production processes in the biopharmaceutical industry reduce the Group’s exposure to 
the risk of growing price pressure."
"Distribution logistics have been optimized in recent years through the 
establishment and use of central warehouses, thus limiting the corresponding risks."
"Geopolitical crises often lead to trade restrictions or sanctions for certain products in individual countries or 
regions."
"A tightening of sanctions in the current conflicts or the adoption of further restrictions, for example 
due to new crises, may therefore more extensively limit the Group’s sales opportunities."
"Opportunities arise in the area of sales and distribution when the increasing breadth of the product range – in 
both the bioprocess and lab segments – puts the Group in a position to sell new products to existing 
customers."
"Furthermore, opportunities arise for Sartorius from its generally long-term business relationships 
and its global presence."
"Finally, the product range is being continuously expanded through acquisitions, which 
has recently resulted in an increased portfolio for customers particularly in the cell and gene therapeutics 
segment, which is seeing above-average growth."
"Sartorius sources its key customers from the pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries and from research 
and educational institutions in the public sector."
"These customers are usually relatively large organizations that 
have been in existence for some time and have strong credit ratings and correspondingly low credit risks."
"Most 
of the Group’s business areas have a highly diversified customer base, so the Group as a whole is not 
dependent on individual key accounts to any significant degree."
"Sartorius 
Combined Group Management Report    Opportunity and Risk Report

Start 
 
Competitive Risks and Opportunities 
Sartorius has a leading competitive position in its core technologies and competes with mainly larger rivals 
sharing its status as a globally operating company."
"As the Group serves a large number of customers from 
highly regulated sectors, such as the pharmaceutical and food industries, and the technology barriers to 
market entry are fairly high, Sartorius regards the probability of new competitors emerging in the short term as 
relatively low."
"The fact that many of the Group’s products are used in validated processes, especially those in the 
biopharmaceutical industry, reduces the risk of losing significant market share within a short time frame."
"Conversely, the hurdles faced by Sartorius in winning clients from competitors in this industry are also higher."
"Further risks could arise from a change in the competitive environment, such as further consolidation in the 
markets or new competitors, for example in China."
"Sartorius has been continuously making acquisitions in 
recent years, thus further strengthening its market position and opening up new potential synergies."
"Quality Risks and Opportunities 
Customers use Sartorius products in a wide range of critical production processes, including the manufacture 
of vaccines, medications, foods, and chemicals, and in research and development laboratories."
"Risks in this 
context primarily involve the failure to meet defined quality criteria, affecting the performance of the supplied 
products and leading to losses on the part of customers, for which Sartorius may be held liable in the form of 
damages."
"Particularly where the manufacture of vaccines or medications is concerned, the resulting damage 
on the customer side can be significant even where the loss of production volumes is small."
"Through extensive quality controls and the use of modern manufacturing techniques, including in classified 
clean room environments where required, Sartorius ensures that all of its products meet the highest standards 
of quality and the stringent regulatory requirements."
"These manufacturing methods and processes are subject 
to constant review as part of improvement processes and are constantly optimized as requirements evolve."
"Quality controls are carried out both within the manufacturing processes and as part of test procedures on the 
end products."
This ensures that critical or essential product specifications are continuously achieved.
"A 
rigorous product release process also ensures that only products that meet agreed upon specifications are 
actually shipped."
"The effectiveness of the existing quality systems has been confirmed by the successful completion of regular 
customer audits, as well as by certifications to ISO 9001 and, where applicable, to ISO 13485."
"Irrespective 
thereof, product liability risks are insured to a significant extent."
"Sartorius is continuously expanding its product portfolio with new technologies and applications, not only 
through its own developments but also through alliances with partners."
"To ensure that the partners meet the 
high quality standards, a strict qualification process has been put in place."
"Where necessary, the Group also 
helps its partners improve their quality systems."
"In addition, Sartorius has established a traceability system that enables the Group to efficiently identify and, if 
required, recall an entire production batch immediately."
"This minimizes the consequences if a defect or 
nonconforming component is discovered in a product."
"A complaint management system is used to process 
and systematically document customer feedback in a timely manner, ensuring that Sartorius efficiently 
analyzes reported cases and initiates the necessary measures."
"There is a risk that new regulations may be overlooked or be difficult to 
implement."
"For Sartorius, this also unlocks opportunities by putting up further barriers to entry for potential 
market players."
"The reason is that challenging quality demands represent a considerable barrier to entry for 
potential new competitors and provide stimulus for further technical innovation."
"Moreover, through the 
Group’s work on professional committees and membership in industry associations and standards 
committees, Sartorius actively takes part in drafting new standards and guidelines and is able to identify these 
emerging requirements at an early stage and prepare accordingly."
"Research and Development Risks and Opportunities 
Sartorius devotes a considerable share of its resources to research and development."
"Potential risks in this area 
may arise from development results that diverge from market needs or application requirements and from 
exceeding planned development deadlines and budgets."
"The Group mitigates these risks by continuously 
monitoring trends and extensive proof-of-concept activities on the one hand, and through project 
management, intensive development controlling, and the early involvement of customers in the development 
process on the other."
"In particular, Sartorius ensures that proofs-of-concept and product designs are always 
reviewed promptly with regard to how well they meet customers’ needs so products can be adapted 
accordingly as required."
"Continuously tracking technology trends and competitive activities, as well as filing 
patents at an early stage, ensures that the Group has an appropriate technology and marketing position."
"Intensive collaboration with partners who are among the global market and opinion leaders in their fields 
enables Sartorius to develop particularly innovative products."
"The combination of different innovative 
activities in a separate Corporate Research Department enables the Group to identify promising 
developments at universities, startups and at customers’ plants and ensure that all relevant IP positions are 
secured in advance."
"Acquisition Risks and Opportunities 
By nature, acquisitions provide many opportunities, such as sales growth, extension of the product portfolio, 
and development of new markets."
"At the same time, the purchase and sale of companies or parts of companies 
entail a number of typical risks, such as incorrect valuation assumptions, insufficient usage of anticipated 
synergy effects, or unsuccessful integration."
The Group takes a number of measures to mitigate these risks.
"These include performing a thorough due 
diligence review of important areas and carrying out comprehensive analysis of the market concerned."
"Furthermore, external consultants and experts are integrated into the purchase or sales processes as required."
Appropriate insurance policies are taken out when necessary.
"Immediately after an acquisition has taken place, an integration phase is initiated in which any potential risks 
can likewise be detected as early as possible and prevented or minimized by taking the appropriate 
counteractions."
"Sartorius has made major acquisitions in recent years, particularly in cell and gene therapy."
"In 2023, the Group 
acquired Polyplus, a leading developer and producer of high-quality transfection and other DNA/RNA vector 
reagents and plasmid DNA."
"The purchase price of this transaction was around €2.4 billion (including liabilities 
assumed)."
"At the same time, net debt and interest expenses have risen significantly."
"If the business areas addressed by 
the acquisitions (e.g., cell and gene therapeutics) do not develop as expected or the acquisitions cannot be 
adequately integrated, this may significantly affect the Group’s credit rating and therefore its development."
"Personnel Risks and Opportunities 
As an innovative technology group, Sartorius employs a large percentage of highly qualified people."
"This 
entails the risk that Sartorius may not be able to hire appropriate employees in the future or may lose high 
performers currently working for the company."
"The increasing volatility of the business in recent years poses 
big challenges for the integration and familiarization of new employees (growth scenario)."
"It also demands 
major flexibility and the ability to efficiently and effectively implement organizational changes."
"Sartorius strives to retain employees in key positions and talented individuals over the long term by offering 
performance-based compensation models, targeted training opportunities, attractive fringe benefits, and by 
highlighting interesting development prospects."
"In this context, the Group particularly continued to enhance 
staff development initiatives and management programs."
"The success of these measures is reflected in the 
low attrition rates seen in recent years."
"In certain cases, employment contracts contain a clause prohibiting any 
move to a direct competitor."
"Sartorius is countering demographic change primarily by training junior employees and promoting continuous 
learning for every employee, accompanied by appropriate performance development processes."
"This, in turn, 
creates opportunities for the Group, as training its own employees ensures that Sartorius can meet its own 
demand for qualified personnel."
"In order to smoothly onboard new employees and ensure an appropriate transfer of knowledge, the Group has 
developed and implemented specific onboarding processes for employees and managers."
"In addition, 
Sartorius uses a digital HR platform that supports secure and stable processes and enables decisions to be 
made on the basis of high-quality data."
"IT Risks and Opportunities 
The Sartorius Group’s business processes are supported by a wide array of specific IT systems and software 
applications."
"The technical IT infrastructure and global integration of Sartorius sites play a decisive role in the 
operation and optimization of business processes."
"However, the growing dependency on these systems also entails risks."
"Among other threats, cyberattacks 
pose a major hazard that can lead to considerable disruption and interruption to business processes."
"In the 
worst case, such attacks could result in uncontrolled loss of data, data manipulation, and downtime or failure 
of applications, systems, and equipment."
"Sartorius 
Combined Group Management Report    Opportunity and Risk Report 
 
82 
 
 
Start 
 
To minimize these risks, the Group invests continuously in new and reliable technologies and ensures the 
secure operation of applications, systems, and equipment."
"In the past fiscal year, certification to ISO 27001 and 
the associated creation of a management system for information security marked another important step in 
ensuring the secure operation of the global IT infrastructure and application landscape."
"Sartorius works with certified IT security partners to develop strategic solutions for IT security and efficiency 
and regularly tests the security of systems and equipment."
"In response to dynamic risks and threats, additions and amendments to the security strategy are constantly 
integrated and implemented in the system and application landscape."
"These measures offer reliable 
protection and enable us to identify potential threats at an early stage and respond quickly and appropriately."
"Sartorius involves employees in the security strategy both by offering basic training and by regularly providing 
easy-to-implement but effective strategies for staying safe when using information technology."
"Employees 
are encouraged to report suspicious activities directly to the IT Department for further investigation."
"Financial Risks and Opportunities 
The global nature of the Sartorius Group’s operations entails that its business activities are inevitably exposed 
to financial risks."
"The most significant of these are exchange rate risks, interest rate risks, liquidity risks, and tax 
risks."
"Conversely, financial risks, most notably exchange rate risks and interest rate risks, are balanced by 
opportunities of approximately equal magnitude."
"Exchange Rate Risks and Opportunities 
As a consequence of its global business activities, Sartorius is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in 
foreign exchange rates."
"Since around two-thirds of the Group’s consolidated sales revenue is generated in 
foreign currencies and, in turn, approximately two-thirds of this total revenue in foreign currencies is in U.S."
dollars or in currencies pegged to the U.S.
"dollar, Sartorius is positively or negatively impacted by currency 
effects when converting the currencies of balance sheet items and profit or loss items, respectively."
"Other 
currencies relevant to the Sartorius Group are the British pound, the Singapore dollar, the South Korean won, 
the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, and the Swiss franc."
"The Group’s global production network enables Sartorius to offset the majority of sales revenues generated in 
foreign currencies within the Group against costs likewise incurred in foreign currency."
"For example, Sartorius 
manufactures many products for the North American market locally, and is not disadvantaged on the cost side 
in competing with U.S."
"rivals, insofar as this risk is concerned."
"Sartorius continuously calculates its risk exposure with a cash flow at-risk model in order to evaluate and steer 
the remaining risk based on the expected net exposure for the next 12 months and to take into consideration 
hedging transactions already executed."
"This is the basis used to decide whether to employ additional 
derivative financial instruments, especially spot, forward, and swap transactions, to adjust for maximum loss."
"Further details on currency hedging can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in 
section 37."
"The remaining portion of the 
financing instruments outstanding as of the reporting date is subject to variable interest rates on the basis of 
a short-term money market rate."
"Sartorius constantly monitors interest rate trends and the Group’s interest 
rate exposure and arranges for hedging transactions where it is considered necessary and financially advisable 
to do so for individual loans."
"The Group did not hold any interest rate derivatives as of December 31, 2023 (see 
also section 38 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements)."
"Liquidity Risks and Opportunities 
Sartorius operates an active central liquidity management system in order to minimize the liquidity risks in the 
individual Group companies on the one hand and to optimize the Group’s net interest income on the other."
"A 
variety of long-term and short-term financing instruments are used for this purpose."
"With regard to the 
maturities of loans, Sartorius generally adopts a risk-averse approach."
"In September 2023, the Sartorius Group issued long-term, unsecured fixed-interest bonds with a total volume 
of €3 billion."
"The bonds had maturities of between three and 12 years and interest rates ranging from 4.375% 
to 4.875%."
"The proceeds were used particularly to repay the bridge financing for the Polyplus acquisition and 
additionally for general corporate purposes."
"A syndicated credit line of €800 million, which can be drawn down and repaid at short notice, and several 
smaller bilateral credit lines at individual Group companies are used to secure short-term liquidity."
"Furthermore, cash pooling agreements between selected Group companies are primarily used to manage 
liquidity across the Group, ensuring that available liquidity is used efficiently."
"There are currently no financing agreements that require the Group to comply with financial key ratios, so-
called financial covenants."
"Tax risks 
Sartorius and its subsidiaries do business across the globe and are therefore subject to the tax laws and 
regimes of various countries."
"Changes in tax laws, rulings by the courts, and interpretation of the law by the 
fiscal authorities or courts in these countries can result in additional tax expenses and payments and thus also 
affect the corresponding tax items in the statements of financial position and profit or loss."
"The central Group Tax Department, which is supported by external consultants in the respective countries, 
continuously monitors and analyzes the tax environment in order to manage the resulting risks."
"In 2021, the OECD published detailed rules on implementing the reform of the international tax system, which 
is designed to ensure that multinationals are subject to a minimum tax rate of 15%."
"The minimum tax rate will 
apply to multinational enterprises with revenues of over €750 million and will therefore have implications for 
the Group."
"Based on the information currently available about the implementation of these rules in the 
principal countries where the Group operates, the impacts are expected to be small."
"According to current 
analyses, the Group companies in Ireland (nominal tax rate 12.5%) could be affected."
"Sartorius

Compliance Risks 
Regulatory Risks 
As a partner to the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries, Sartorius is also affected by regulatory 
changes in these sectors."
"The primary risk in this context is the possibility of regulatory authorities, such as the 
U.S."
"Food & Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or other national or 
international bodies, taking a more restrictive approach to the approval of new drugs or medical devices of our 
customers."
"Given the breadth of the Group’s product portfolio, there are a growing number of relevant 
regulations to comply with."
"These include official requirements, such as from the Environmental Protection 
Agency or Department of Agriculture in the USA or the equivalents of these authorities in other countries."
"Global initiatives to reduce or even ban the use of certain chemicals (e.g., PFAS) can have considerable 
impacts on numerous of the Group’s products, their applications, and the availability of crucial raw materials."
"Failure on the part of Sartorius’ customers to adequately comply with the regulations in force at any given time 
could delay approval processes or even reduce the number of newly approved drugs and thus also worsen the 
Group’s future prospects in the medium term."
"With regard to its own products, the Group is also subject to 
extensive approval, registration, and reporting obligations in numerous countries."
"Failure to comply with the 
often complex requirements could result in sales or import bans as well as penalties."
"The functions responsible 
for regulatory affairs at Sartorius monitor the affected markets and assess whether the Group needs to make 
any changes to its processes."
"In recent years, regulations on environmental, social, and governance aspects have been stepped up."
"These 
areas play an important role in companies’ reputation."
"As the manufacturer of numerous plastic products with 
production sites around the globe, Sartorius faces a variety of challenges."
"Environmental and sustainability 
aspects are therefore playing an increasingly important role in many business processes at Sartorius."
"For more 
information on these topics, please see the non-financial Group statement."
"Environmental Risks from the Production Process 
Sartorius uses a wide range of raw materials and supplies in its manufacturing process, including chemicals, 
plastics, metals, electronic components, and packaging."
"Some production processes create solvent waste, 
which must be recycled and disposed of in line with certain rules and regulations."
"In this context, there is a risk 
of the Group not complying with the legal requirements in this area."
"Environmental damage may harm 
Sartorius’ reputation and have legal or financial repercussions."
"To further increase the Group’s agility in 
fulfilling the legal regulations and industry expectations, platforms for managing environmental, health, and 
safety data need continuous improvement."
Responsibility for compliance with all applicable regulations lies with the sites and business units.
"The 
Environment, Health, and Safety Department offers them support and conducts audits."
"In order to manage 
environmental issues and mitigate risks, Sartorius has established environmental management systems 
(according to ISO 14001:2015) for both divisions."
"Most of the Group’s large production sites, including several 
in Germany, France, India, Puerto Rico, and China, are certified to ISO 14001:2015."
"These locations have 
suitable measures in place to ensure compliance with legal and internal requirements and to implement 
sustainable technical innovations so as to improve environmental aspects in production processes."
"Sartorius

Risks from Legal Disputes 
Litigation risks for Sartorius can arise from pending or forthcoming legal disputes or from administrative 
proceedings."
"All judicial or extrajudicial disputes are attended to by the company’s own attorneys and legal 
experts, who engage external lawyers as needed."
"At present, there are no pending or discernible legal disputes or proceedings whose occurrence is deemed at 
least possible that lack any cost coverage allowances in the statement of financial position and that could have 
a substantial negative impact on the Group."
"For the purposes of this report, Sartorius has assessed the probability of occurrence of risks as shown below 
and, in the adjacent columns, classified their particular significance for the entire Group."
The overall risk situation remained largely stable in the past fiscal year.
"However, the direct and indirect risks 
from ongoing or potentially newly emerging geopolitical crises have increased further."
"Growth in industrialized countries is expected 
at 1.4% (2023: + 1.5%), while the forecast for emerging and developing countries is unchanged at 4.0%."
"The potential spread of China’s real estate crisis also poses risks to 
global economic growth."
"The IMF expects growth of 1.5% for the EU in 2024, compared with 0.7% in 2023."
"Source: International Monetary Fund 
Based on current estimates, the U.S."
economy is expected to expand by 1.5% in 2024 (2023: + 2.1%).
"The Asia | Pacific economic region is forecast to grow by around 4.2% (2023: + 4.6%), with GDP in China 
expected to increase by 4.2% (2023: + 5.0%) and in India by 6.3% (2023: + 6.3%)."
"Other countries in this region 
that are important for Sartorius are also expected to grow."
"South Korea’s GDP is forecast to go up by 2.2% 
(2023: + 1.4%) and Japan’s by 1.0% (2023: + 2.0%)."
"Based on expert estimates, key interest rates are not 
expected to rise further in 2024 and are likely to be cut moderately in the second half of the year."
"Key interest 
rates in the European Monetary Union are expected to decrease from 4.50% at the end of 2023 to up to 3.8% 
in 2024."
"Federal Reserve is forecast to cut the key interest rate to an estimated 4.45% by the end of

"Outlook for the Sectors 
Biopharmaceutical Industry Expected to Grow 
Strong, long-term trends drive growth in the pharmaceutical industry, which is almost entirely independent of 
business cycles."
"A number of different studies estimate that the global pharmaceutical market will grow by 
between 3% and 6% annually in the period up to 2027."
"Within the pharmaceutical market, the biopharma 
segment has been enjoying particularly strong performance for years and will continue to outperform the 
market according to various forecasts."
"Average annual growth is expected to be around 10% in the coming 
years."
"The market is anticipated to have a total value of around $695 billion in 2028, which means that the share 
of biological medications and vaccines as a percentage of total revenue in the global pharmaceutical market 
could rise from the current 39% to 44%."
"Growth is driven in particular by the increasing demand for medications from the growing and aging global 
population as well as the great catch-up potential and improved access to biopharmaceuticals in emerging 
markets."
"In addition, the number of approved biopharmaceutical medications is steadily increasing."
"Of the 
estimated 20,000+ medications in R&D pipelines, almost 45% are based on biological manufacturing 
processes."
"For example, biopharmaceuticals are increasingly being used in yet-to-be fully explored 
therapeutic areas and in the treatment of rare diseases that have so far been incurable."
"The pharma industry is 
increasingly concentrating on advanced therapies such as cell and gene therapeutics or biotechnologically 
processed tissue products."
"In 2023, more than 1,600 clinical trials with such treatment approaches were 
conducted, meaning that this area offers significant growth potential over the medium to long term."
"Innovative 
types of therapy for regenerative medicine and new substance classes, such as antibody-drug conjugates 
(ADCs) or mRNA-based drugs, are increasing the number and range of approved biopharmaceuticals in the 
long term and necessitating investments in innovative production technologies."
"As a result, they are key 
growth drivers."
"Biosimilars, i.e., generic versions of reference biologics with comparable or better efficacy or fewer side effects 
than the original compounds, are also playing an increasingly important role in the growth of the 
biotechnology market."
"Current estimates indicate that by 2028, the market could grow by an annual average 
of around 15% and reach a total value of approximately $67 billion."
"The significantly lower prices of biosimilars, 
particularly in emerging and developing countries, are creating new, affordable therapy options and are 
projected to result in increased demand and rising production volume."
"The development of national

production capacities to meet the growing demand for medications is receiving political support in these 
countries and is fueling the establishment of local biotech companies."
"The biosimilars market in industrialized 
countries is also likely to expand considerably in the coming years due to the expiration of patents for high-
selling biopharmaceuticals and an increasing number of approved biosimilars."
"While such generic 
medications have been widely used in Europe for many years and have been able to gain significant market 
share in some areas, progress in the USA has been rather slow until now due to regulatory, patent law-related, 
and marketing hurdles."
"In the next few years, however, the trend toward increased usage of biosimilars is likely 
to accelerate."
"Biopharmaceuticals Are Gaining Importance – Growing Share of Sales in the Global Pharmaceutical Market 
 
 
The biopharmaceutical industry must meet growing demand for medications while producing an increasing 
number of approved medications and ensuring new types of therapy."
"Therefore, industry observers expect 
that worldwide bioreactor capacities will continue to expand in the years to come."
"At the same time, the 
industry faces rising cost pressure."
"This increases the significance of innovations for boosting flexibility and 
efficiency in biopharmaceutical research and production."
"In the future, the biopharmaceutical market will shift 
away from a low number of especially high-selling medications that account for a majority of total production 
volume toward an expanding range of products for smaller groups of patients."
"Technological progress leads 
to ongoing improvements in the productivity of biopharmaceutical production processes."
"Therefore, 
according to the research and consulting institute BioPlan, many manufacturers will likely rely increasingly on 
flexibly usable single-use technologies for the commercial production of many new medications."
"Particularly 
in the case of relatively small batches, single-use technologies already ensure more cost-effective production 
than conventional stainless steel units and have a better environmental footprint."
"To master these challenges, 
more and more pharmaceutical companies are relying on digitalization and automation as well as innovative 
software solutions for controlling and optimizing their processes."
"A further trend is process intensification, in 
which several process steps, called unit operations, are interconnected, which, among other things, enables 
greater product quantities to be manufactured faster while achieving higher quality."
"Further Growth Expected in the Laboratory Market 
Various market observers expect the market for laboratory instruments and consumables to grow by around 
5% annually in the next few years and to reach a total value of around $103 billion in 2027."
"For 
instance, EvaluatePharma expects sector-specific research spending to increase annually by 3.6% during the 
period from 2023 to 2028."
"According to market studies, the product area of bioanalytical instruments should 
particularly benefit from this and further grow at an above-average rate within the laboratory market."
"According to leading providers of laboratory instruments, demand for laboratory products in the 
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries is expected to expand moderately in 2024, despite the 
encouraging medium-term outlook."
"The reasons cited include restrained investment activity in the current 
interest rate environment, the persistently muted funding environment, especially for small and medium-sized 
biotech companies, and severe market weakness in China."
"Budget increases for academic and public-sector research institutions should continue to act as a growth 
driver in some countries, while the projected slowdown in global economic growth poses risks to demand from 
industrial end markets."
"Market observers continue to expect China and India to generate the highest growth 
rates in the medium term."
"Stricter regulatory requirements in a range of industries are also stimulating 
increased demand for instruments used in sample analysis and quality control."
"In addition, investments in 
laboratory infrastructure are becoming more attractive, especially in China, as a result of government-
supported efforts to promote innovativeness in several key industries."
"In previous years, this had entailed a rise 
in the share of global R&D spending attributable to China."
"Due to inventory 
optimization measures at customers that have not yet been fully completed, the company projects business 
momentum to increase gradually in the course of the year, resulting in a rather moderate first half of 2024."
"In 
addition, business performance could also be affected by increasing geopolitical tensions and economic 
slowdowns in some regions."
"Against this backdrop of still somewhat unstable market trends and therefore limited visibility, management 
forecasts an increase in Group sales revenue in the mid to high single-digit percentage range, with a non-
organic contribution accounting for around 1.5 percentage points."
"In terms of profitability, management 
anticipates the underlying EBITDA margin to rise to slightly more than 30%, compared with the prior-year 
figure of 28.3%."
"At around 13%, the ratio of capital expenditures to sales revenue is expected to be below the 
2023 figure of 16.5%."
"Excluding possible capital measures and/or acquisitions, the ratio of net debt to 
underlying EBITDA is projected to be at around 4."
"For the Bioprocess Solutions division, management expects a gradual continuation of the demand recovery 
and an increase in sales revenue in the mid to high single-digit percentage range, including a contribution of 
acquired businesses of around 2 percentage points."
"The underlying EBITDA margin is projected to be over 
31%, compared with the prior-year figure of 29.2%."
"The above-average profitability of the Polyplus business will 
have a slightly positive effect on the margin development."
"Business in the Lab Products & Services division depends to an extent on economic conditions and a series of 
indicators currently pointing to a subdued development in key economic regions."
"Against this backdrop and 
despite the observed recovery trends, management predicts a subdued sales revenue increase in the low 
single-digit percentage range and an underlying EBITDA margin at around the previous year’s level of 25.1%."
"All forecasts are based on constant currencies, as in the past years."
"Management points out that the industry 
has become increasingly dynamic and volatile in recent years."
"In addition, uncertainties due to the shifting 
geopolitical situation, such as various countries’ nascent decoupling tendencies, are playing an increasing role."
This results in increased uncertainty when forecasting business figures.
"The main priority of the system as it relates to Sartorius AG’s and the Group’s accounting process is to verify 
that accounting is cost-efficient and formally correct and that it complies with the applicable legal provisions."
"The internal control system of Sartorius AG and of the Sartorius Group consists of a combination of process-
integrated and non-process-integrated monitoring measures."
"The process-integrated safeguarding 
measures are organizational measures on the one hand, and control measures on the other."
"The Supervisory 
Board, specifically in this case the Audit Committee of Sartorius AG, and the Group Auditing Department are 
involved in the Sartorius Group’s internal control system through their non-process-integrated audit activities."
"The Audit Committee regularly reviews quarterly reports in addition to the annual financial statements of the 
parent corporation and the consolidated annual financial statements."
"The 
efficacy of the early risk detection system, which the Sartorius Group adapts promptly in response to any 
relevant changes in circumstances, is assessed by the independent auditors of Sartorius AG in accordance 
with Section 317(4) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"An integral component of this system is also 
operational risk management, which involves activities such as the transfer of risk to insurance companies 
through coverage for damage and liability risks, and the arrangement of suitable hedges to limit currency risks 
and interest rate risks."
"Organizational Measures 
Accounting processes are strictly organized according to the principle of segregation of functions and comply 
with the ""four-eyes"" principle – i.e., review by at least two individuals, also referred to as the dual-review or 
multiple-review principle."
"Duties and responsibilities are clearly assigned to different specialized departments 
and companies."
"The separation of administrative, executive, settlement, and approval functions reduces the 
possibility of fraud."
"It also continues to play a significant role in ensuring that any possible errors are discovered 
early and any potential misconduct is prevented."
"The IT applications used in the company’s accounting processes have access restrictions, which allow only 
authorized persons to have controlled access to the accounting system and data."
"Each access right is assigned 
specifically according to the tasks to be performed and is subject to annual review."
"Furthermore, the dual-
review principle is also applied in IT process design and the assignment of access rights."

In addition, defined written local and global operating procedures exist that are regularly updated and 
communicated throughout the Group."
"The scope of regulation of the Group accounting guidelines extends 
to the central definition of valuation rules and parameters, among other aspects."
"Additional data for the 
presentation of external information in the notes to the financial statements and in the Group management 
report is also prepared and aggregated at Group level."
"Continuous coordination of internal accounting during the year for planning and control with external 
accounting contributes significantly to the quality of Group financial reporting."
"Reporting itself is done 
through a standardized reporting system implemented throughout the Group."
"This system visualizes all 
consolidation processes."
"Internal controls on the one hand, and the Group auditors of Sartorius AG on the 
other, ensure that Group financial reports are accurately generated from the consolidated Group companies’ 
financial statements."
The employees involved in the accounting process meet qualitative standards and receive regular training.
"The Group Financial Reporting Department assists the local units in resolving complex accounting issues, 
such as measuring fair value, to ensure consistent and accurate reporting in the consolidated financial 
statements."
"Complex evaluations, such as actuarial calculations and company valuations or purchase price 
allocations, are assigned to specialized service providers who involve the respectively qualified in-house staff."
"Control Measures 
Comprehensive control activities are performed by managers and staff to ensure effective and reliable 
accounting."
"As a result, this ensures compliance with legal requirements and internal guidelines as well as 
properly conducted business transactions."
"Examples of such control activities include the analysis of situations 
and developments with reference to specific key indicators."
"Moreover, every month individual reporting units 
comment on and explain special characteristics or variances using Group-wide standardized analytical tools 
as the basis."
"Further specific control activities performed to ensure effective and reliable Group accounting 
encompass the analysis and, where applicable, correction of the individual financial statements submitted by 
the Sartorius Group companies."
"A large number of automated control mechanisms already incorporated into 
the consolidated reporting system enable erroneous information to be identified and corrected at Group level."
"Impairment tests are conducted centrally for assets and/or cash-generating units considered material from 
the Group's perspective in order to ensure that consistent, standardized evaluation criteria are applied."
"The Group Auditing Department draws up a risk-based audit plan annually and reviews in spot checks whether 
basic legal requirements and internal group guidelines are complied with for the entire control and risk 
management system of the Group."
"This monitoring function covers, in particular, audits of the functional 
efficiency and effectiveness of defined control measures."
"The results of these audits are reported directly to 
the audited departments and units, making it possible to efficiently remedy any identified deficiencies and to 
further enhance the company’s internal control system (ICS)."
"The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board 
regularly receive reports on audit activities."
"The main rules governing the organization of the internal control system are defined in a manual based on 
business processes."
"This manual combines all ICS-relevant requirements that Group management considers 
of material importance into one standardized document and will be supplemented by further appropriate rules 
as necessary."
"Yet it must be considered that 
an internal control system, regardless of its design, cannot guarantee absolute certainty with regard to the 
correct and complete recording of facts in the consolidated financial statements."
"The statements made relate solely to the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements of 
Sartorius AG, provided that this parent company has direct or indirect control over such subsidiaries within the 
meaning of the international accounting standards."
"It comprises 74,880,000 no par value individual bearer 
shares, 37,440,000 of which are ordinary shares and 37,440,000 of which are non-voting preference shares."
Each share certificate represents a calculated proportion of €1 of the issued capital.
"The rights and obligations associated with these shares are governed by the provisions of the German Stock 
Corporation Law (Aktiengesetz, abbreviated “AktG”)."
"According to the company’s Articles of Association, 
preference shares are entitled to a dividend payment that is one euro cent higher per share than that for 
ordinary shares."
"However, this entitlement to receive dividends shall be at least two euro cents per preference 
share."
"Apart from the cases provided for in Sections 140 and 141 AktG, preference shares are non-voting."
"Beyond this, preference shares grant all other rights to which every shareholder is entitled."
The company is not entitled to any rights from its treasury shares.

Corporate Governance Report 
The following content was not included in the audit of the Group Management Report and the Non-financial 
Group Statement."
"Corporate governance aligned with the interests of stakeholders, lawful and responsible conduct, and 
constructive cooperation between the managerial bodies and within the company in a spirit of mutual trust 
constitute the essential cornerstones of Sartorius’ corporate culture."
"The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board report in the following declaration on the company’s 
corporate governance pursuant to Section 289f of the German Commercial Code (“HGB”)."
"The Supervisory Board 
believes that the existing structure of the variable remuneration, which corresponds to the remuneration 
system approved by the Annual General Meeting, also achieves an incentive structure geared to the 
sustainable and long-term development of the Company."
"With the Annual General Meeting, Supervisory Board; and Executive Board, it has three corporate 
managerial bodies whose tasks and powers are essentially derived from the German Stock Corporation Law 
(“Aktiengesetz”, abbreviated in German as “AktG”) and the company’s Articles of Association."
"The Annual General Meeting is held at least once a year within the first eight months of the respective 
fiscal year."
"In managing the company, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board perform their tasks in a dual 
management system, each with separate duties and powers."
"The Supervisory Board appoints members to the Executive Board, determines their compensation and 
monitors and advises the Executive Board in its management of the company."
"The Supervisory Board is not 
authorized to take any operational management measures for the business."
"The Supervisory Board’s rules of 
procedure are published on the company’s website."
The Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company.
"In particular, it defines 
corporate strategy, coordinates and agrees on this approach with the Supervisory Board, and implements such 
corporate strategy."
"In line with established reporting obligations, the Executive Board regularly informs the 
Supervisory Board promptly and comprehensively, and requests the latter's approval for certain key business 
transactions."
"The members serve a 
regular term of office of five years."
Members can be reelected.
"Details on the members of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees are provided on pages 254 to 256."
"The Supervisory Board Chairman coordinates the work of the Supervisory Board, convenes the meetings, and 
chairs them."
"Furthermore, he is the first individual for the Executive Board to contact and externally represents 
the matters of the Supervisory Board."
The Supervisory Board holds at least two meetings every six months.
"This board has established four 
committees: the Executive Task Committee, the Audit Committee, the Conciliation Committee, and the 
Nomination Committee."
"The Executive Task Committee, Audit Committee, and Conciliation Committee each 
have four members, consisting of an equal number of shareholder representatives and employee 
representatives."
"The Executive Task Committee and Audit Committee hold regular meetings; the Conciliation 
Committee and the Nomination Committee meet only as necessary."
"It must include at least one member of the Supervisory Board with expertise in the field of accounting and at 
least one other member with expertise in the field of auditing."
"The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr. Klaus Trützschler, is independent and has expertise in the 
fields of accounting, auditing, and risk management thanks to his many years of service as Chief Financial 
Officer, Audit Committee member, and professor of business administration."
"In addition, Professor Trützschler 
actively follows current developments in the field of sustainability regulation and reporting and contributes 
this expertise to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board of Sartorius AG."
"As a further member of the Audit Committee, Dr. Lothar Kappich has particular knowledge and experience in 
the application of accounting principles and internal control procedures from his professional practice as a 
controller, general manager, and management consultant."

shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"In doing so, it takes into account the goals regarding 
the Board’s composition."
"Further information on the number and agenda of the individual meetings of the Supervisory Board and its 
committees as well as individual meeting attendance in the reporting year can be found in the Supervisory 
Board's report on pages 12 to 17."
"The Supervisory Board carries out an assessment annually to determine how 
effectively the board as a whole and its committees fulfill their tasks."
"In the reporting year, this self-assessment 
(efficiency audit) was completed with external support on the basis of an extensive questionnaire."
"In addition 
to answering the questions, the respondents had options to give further comments and suggestions regarding 
Supervisory Board work."
"The results of this survey were presented in anonymized form in December 2023 and 
discussed within the Supervisory Board."
"Further information on the results of the self-assessment in 2023 are 
contained in the Report of the Supervisory Board."
"Appointment Objectives for the Supervisory Board in terms of Areas of 
Expertise and Diversity 
Members of the Supervisory Board of Sartorius AG are to be appointed such that they, on the whole, have the 
knowledge, skills, and experience that are necessary to perform the Board’s duties properly."
"For this purpose and based on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the 
Supervisory Board decided on the following appointment objectives: 
▪ Diversity: The members of the Supervisory Board should have complementary professional 
profiles and international experience."
"In view of achieving an appropriate gender balance, the 
legal quotas of at least 30% women and at least 30% men apply to the Sartorius Supervisory 
Board."
"The shareholder representatives and the employee representatives decided to fulfill these 
legal targets separately."
"Further details can be found in the Supervisory Board’s competence 
profile."
"▪ Age limit: A fundamental age limit of 70 applies to members of the Supervisory Board at the time 
they are elected."
"The age limit may be waived in individual cases, provided there are no 
reservations about the suitability of the persons proposed and their election is expedient to the 
interests of the company in spite of the age limit being exceeded."
"A Supervisory Board member who is a member 
of the management board of a listed company must not hold more than two Supervisory Board 
positions at external listed companies or perform comparable functions, and must not chair the 
Supervisory Board at an external listed company."
"Regardless of other mandates held, care must 
be taken that every member has enough time to fulfill his or her mandate in the Supervisory Board 
of Sartorius AG."
"▪ Independence: According to the GCGC, the Supervisory Board should include an appropriate 
number of shareholder representatives, but no less than four independent members."
"The 
ownership structure is to be taken into account."
"In the opinion of the shareholder representatives 
on the Supervisory Board, Prof. Dr. David Ebsworth, Dr. Daniela Favoccia, Ilke Hildegard Panzer, 
Frank Riemensperger, and Prof. Dr. Klaus Rüdiger Trützschler are independent members of the 
Supervisory Board."
"As the executor for the community of heirs of Horst Sartorius, Dr. Lothar 
Kappich is to be regarded as dependent upon the controlling shareholder."
"In their view, his 
long-standing membership in itself does not give rise to any substantial and not merely temporary 
conflict of interests."
"In his duties, Mr. Kappich has demonstrated the necessary critical distance in 
order to properly advise and monitor the company and its Executive Board in every respect."
"The 
Supervisory Board also considers Prof. Dr. Klaus Rüdiger Trützschler, who has been a Supervisory 
Board member for more than 12 years, to be independent within the meaning of C."
"Prof. Dr. Trützschler has no personal or business relationship with Sartorius AG or its 
Executive Board that could give rise to substantial and not merely temporary conflicts of interest."
"For the purpose of assessing the independence of board members, the Supervisory Board is of 
the view that all relevant circumstances should be examined as a whole."
"In the case of Prof. Dr. 
Trützschler, the sole factor of his long tenure is weighed up against his long-standing experience 
and expertise in the fields of accounting, auditing, risk management and sustainability."
"His record 
shows that he exercises his office as a member of the Supervisory Board and as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee in an exemplary manner, at all times fulfilling his role as a critical observer and 
experienced counsel for the Executive Board."
"▪ Former members of the Executive Board: No more than two former members of the Sartorius 
Executive Board are to serve simultaneously on the Supervisory Board."
"▪ Function at competitor companies: Members of the Supervisory Board should not hold any board 
function or consulting mandate at companies that are important competitors of Sartorius AG, and 
should not be in a personal relationship with an important competitor."
"▪ In addition, the Supervisory Board has defined a competence profile."
"The members of the 
Supervisory Board should have experience in the life science sector as well as knowledge of key 
competitors and a basic understanding of marketing and sales strategies."
"▪ Members of the Supervisory Board should have knowledge of technologies and products 
relevant to the Group as well as experience in the fields of innovation processes and research & 
product development, especially in the biopharmaceutical sector."

▪ Members of the Supervisory Board should have expertise in the international markets relevant to 
the Sartorius Group."
Accounting and auditing activities also include sustainability reporting and its audit.
"▪ Members of the Supervisory Board should have in-depth knowledge of law and compliance, in 
particular expertise in the areas of capital markets and corporate law."
"In addition, members should 
have knowledge and experience in the field of corporate governance."
"▪ The Board should have in-depth knowledge of and experience in human resources issues, in 
particular in the fields of international human resources planning as well as executive recruitment 
and succession planning."
"▪ The Supervisory Board should have in-depth knowledge of the Sartorius organizational structure 
and processes in order to be able to take the employees’ perspective into account."
"▪ Members of the Supervisory Board should have experience in the areas of digitalization and data-
based business models."
"▪ Furthermore, there should be sufficient sustainability/ESG and CSR expertise on the Board."
▪ The Supervisory Board should also always include members with international experience or backgrounds.
"According to the Supervisory Board’s self-assessment, the members on its board meet the diversity and 
competency requirements."
"In addition, the board meets the appointment objectives described above."

Competency profile 
With a view to achieving an equal gender balance, the Supervisory Board meets the quota of 30% set for the 
underrepresented gender."
"The Supervisory Board includes a total of seven men (around 58%), of whom four 
are shareholder representatives and three are employee representatives."
"In addition, five women (around 
42%) are members of this board, among them two representatives of the shareholders and three 
representatives of the employees."
"As a result, the gender quota requirements are met on both sides of 
Supervisory Board representation and on the full Supervisory Board itself."
"To facilitate comparison of the appointment objectives, brief resumés of the Supervisory Board members are 
available on the Sartorius website."
"Provision of Information to the Supervisory Board  
The Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with all the information needed for the Supervisory Bord 
to effectively monitor the Executive Board’s management of the company."
"To ensure appropriate information 
provision, the Supervisory Board receives monthly reports that show the course of business at the level of the 
Group, divisions and regions along with developments in the key performance indicators for Sartorius."
"In 
addition, an overview of the past quarter is shown before every meeting, and any deviations from the previous 
year and from the planning are explained."
"The reporting package also regularly includes a capital market 
report, which sets out the performance of Sartorius shares including prices and company valuations relative to 
competitors as well as an overview of analyst assessment and recommendations."
"Once a year as a rule, the 
Executive Board reports verbally and in writing on the budget for the next fiscal year, including operational 
planning, financial planning, investment planning and HR planning, and on the medium-term planning for the 
company’s development."
"Also at least once a year, the Executive Board explains the status and development 
of any legal risks and comments on the risk situation, on risk management, on significant compliance cases and 
on compliance management."
"The relevant Supervisory Board committees also discuss these risk 
management- and compliance-related topics on a quarterly basis and are provided for this purpose with 
relevant written and verbal information."
"Furthermore, the Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board 
on all transactions requiring the latter’s approval under the rules of procedure."
"These particularly include 
acquisition and divestment projects, capital measures, major investments and restructuring projects."
"The 
reports and proposed resolutions are prepared such that the Supervisory Board has the opportunity, before 
the relevant transactions are carried out, to thoroughly consider the proposed measure and its implications, 
give its view and take an informed decision."
"The Supervisory Board is also promptly informed as necessary of 
other important events and developments that could have a noticeable effect on Sartorius’ position."
"If it is not 
possible to report directly in a Supervisory Board meeting, corresponding special reports are provided to the 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board."
"The Chairman then decides on how to involve the Supervisory Board in 
this matter."
"The committee chairpersons also independently set further reporting requirements for the 
Executive Board within their areas of responsibility."
"The Executive Board decides on the form and presentation 
of the reports to the Supervisory Board."
"Details on the content of these reports in the relevant fiscal year and their discussion in the Supervisory Board 
can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board Chairman on page 12."
"Composition and Operating Mode of the Executive 
Board  
The Executive Board of Sartorius AG manages the company under its own responsibility, with the goal of 
increasing the company’s value over the long term."
"It develops the company’s strategy, coordinates it with the 
Supervisory Board, and ensures that this strategy is implemented effectively."
"Beyond that, the rules of 
procedure for the Executive Board define the legal transactions requiring approval by the Supervisory Board 
Sartorius

in order for such transactions to be effected."
"The Executive Board is responsible for compliance with all 
provisions of the law and the company’s internal policies, as well as for appropriate risk management."
"Decision-making by the Executive Board is done at its regular meetings, which are convoked and conducted 
by the Chairman."
Other specialists and managers are invited as necessary to provide advice.
The Executive Board members are jointly responsible as a collegiate body for matters of special significance.
"In all other respects, each member independently manages the area of the company to which he or she has 
been assigned in accordance with the distribution-of-business plan, and the Chairman must be informed of 
all material transactions and events."
"In addition, the Supervisory 
Board also considers the aspect of diversity in its appointment decisions."
"Therefore, the Supervisory Board 
strives to appoint people with complementary profiles, professional and personal life experiences and in 
different age brackets to the Executive Board."
"Moreover, the latter board is required to have broad 
international experience."
"The Supervisory Board deals regularly with succession planning for the Executive Board in its Executive Task 
Committee and in its plenary sessions."
"To identify special talent within the company, promising junior staff are 
invited to make presentations to the Supervisory Board on specific topics."
An Executive Board member must not be older than 65 years of age at the time of his or her appointment.
"This age 
limit can be waived in individual cases, provided there are no reservations about the suitability of the person proposed 
and his or her appointment is expedient to the interests of the company in spite of the age limit being exceeded."
"As of the editorial deadline for this report, the Executive Board of Sartorius AG consisted of two men and one 
woman."
"Before the Chief Financial Officer Rainer Lehmann left the Board at the end of October 2023, it 
consisted of three men and one woman."
"In the period from November 2023 to the end of March 2024, the Finance 
board division is being managed on an interim basis by the Chairman of the Executive Board."
"Further information, including information on memberships of supervisory boards and other comparable 
domestic and foreign supervisory bodies of business enterprises, is published on page 260 et seq."
"The statutory participation requirement pursuant to Section 76(3a) AktG, which came into force in 
August 2022, applies to the number of women on the Executive Board."
"With the appointment of Dr. Alexandra 
Gatzemeyer to the Executive Board, the statutory participation requirement has been implemented."
"Regarding the future appointment of women to the Executive Board of Sartorius AG as well, the Supervisory 
Board supports the activities of the Executive Board to further increase the percentage of female executives 
at the management levels subordinate to the Executive Board in the company."
"The Executive Task Committee 
and the full Supervisory Board regularly receive reports on the development of the proportions of women in 
senior-level management positions."
"First and Second Management Levels Below the Executive Board 
In March 2022, the Executive Board set a target of one-third women to be achieved at both the first and 
second management levels by the deadline of December 31, 2025."
"As of the December 31, 2023 reporting 
date, the proportion of women at both levels was around 31% (first management level: 5 women | 11 men; 
second management level: 30 women | 66 men), putting it within range of the targets set by the Executive 
Board."
"It should be noted that owing to the relatively small number of managers at the first level, even individual 
personnel changes can lead to sizable swings in this percentage."
"The integration of acquired companies has 
frequently led to fluctuations in the past, and this effect cannot be ruled out for the future."
"Further Corporate Governance Practices  
Risk Management, Internal Monitoring System and Compliance 
Management System 
Conscientious management of commercial risks is a key principle of good corporate governance."
"Sartorius AG 
and the Group have at their disposal enterprise-wide and company-specific reporting and control systems 
designed to facilitate the recording, assessment and management of commercial risks."
"These systems are 
developed and adapted continuously as conditions evolve."
"The Executive Board informs the Supervisory 
Board regularly of existing risks and their development."
Details on risk management are presented in the Opportunity and Risk Report.
"The internal control system (ICS) is based on the principles, guidelines, and measures introduced by the 
Executive Board that are aimed at the organizational implementation of the Executive Board’s decisions."
"They 
include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business objectives, 
ensuring that internal and external accounting is accurate and reliable, and compliance with the legal rules and 
regulations relevant to Sartorius."
"This also includes sustainability aspects, which are continuously refined and 
updated on the basis of regulatory requirements."
All of the Sartorius Group’s functions are integrated into a global matrix organization and are part of the ICS.
"The scope of activities each function is responsible for performing varies and depends, among other aspects, 
on the specific risks associated with the function."
"Each function’s management is required to implement an 
appropriate and effective ICS in its area of responsibility, based on the methodology that is mandatory 
throughout the Group."
Overall responsibility for the ICS lies with the Executive Board.
"The Sartorius Group’s individual functions 
support the Executive Board in creating and maintaining appropriate and effective processes for 
implementing, monitoring, and reporting on internal control activities."
"Extensive control activities are carried out by managers and employees within each function’s individually 
defined processes to ensure that the processes are reliable and effective."
"As a result, this ensures compliance 
with legal requirements and internal guidelines as well as properly conducted business transactions."
"Examples 
of such control activities include the analysis of situations and developments with reference to specific key 
indicators."
"Based on the defined control mechanisms, errors can be identified and corrected at the Group 
level."
"In addition, the Group Auditing Department draws up a risk-based audit plan each year and reviews in 
spot checks whether basic legal requirements and internal group guidelines are complied with for the Group’s 
entire control and risk management system."
"This monitoring function covers, in particular, audits of the 
functional efficiency and effectiveness of defined control measures."
"The results of these audits are reported 
directly to the audited functions, making it possible to efficiently remedy any identified deficiencies and to 
further enhance the company’s internal control system (ICS)."
"The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board 
regularly receive reports on audit activities."
"The main rules governing the organization of the ICS are defined 
in a manual based on business processes."
"This manual combines all ICS-relevant requirements that Group 
management considers of material importance into one standardized document and will be supplemented by 
further appropriate rules as necessary."
Part of the ICS is also a compliance management system that is valid worldwide.
"The Sartorius Group’s 
compliance management system is designed to ensure the adherence to statutory and regulatory 
requirements in order to protect the company from sanctions, financial losses and reputational damage."
"It also 
contributes to the quality of Sartorius products and the long-term success of the company."
"To ensure 
compliance at the Sartorius Group, Sartorius has implemented a Group-wide standard, which is documented 
in a Compliance Management Manual."
"This manual summarizes the responsibilities and authority of the 
individual functions and defines processes for efficient cooperation between these functions."
"In this context, Sartorius has introduced various preventive guidelines."
Sartorius has also implemented an Anti-Corruption Code.
"This is intended to serve as a basis for raising 
awareness among all employees of the dangers posed by corruption and also to act as an aid and guide to 
Sartorius

combating corruption."
"It includes rules on the handling of gifts, for example."
"The company ensures that 
employees are familiar with the content of both codes by offering them mandatory online training every year."
"Sartorius also expects its business partners to comply with internationally recognized social and environmental 
standards, to follow the law, adhere to the principles of fair competition and respect human rights."
"These 
requirements are set out in the Code of Conduct for Business Partners."
"A complaint system ensures that everyone, whether inside or outside Sartorius, can report identified or 
reasonably suspected breaches of applicable laws, standards, regulations and internal guidelines."
"For this 
purpose, Sartorius provides various reporting channels, which are available around the clock in various 
languages and can also be used anonymously if preferred."
"The compliance team can be contacted in person, 
via the hotline, by e-mail or via the whistleblower system."
"The reporting channels can be found on Daily 
(intranet) and on the public website."
"The Executive Board is not aware of any circumstances that would speak against the suitability and 
effectiveness of the risk management system and the ICS."
"Further information can be found in the “Description of the Key Features of the Internal Control System” 
section on pages 91 et seq."
and on the company’s website at www.sartorius.com.

Sartorius AG places great importance on disclosing consistent and complete information promptly."
"Information about the economic position of the Group and new developments is consequently released 
regularly, without delay, as it becomes known in order to inform capital market participants and interested 
members of the public at large."
"The annual report, first-half financial report, and quarterly reports are published

Business Model 
Information on the Group’s business model can be found in the section “Business Model, Strategy and Goals” 
on page 28 et seq."
"Sartorius operates in the life science sector – more precisely, in the field of medical biotechnology."
"As a partner 
to the biopharmaceutical industry, the Group manufactures products and process technologies that are used 
in the development and production of biological medicines and vaccines to prevent and treat diseases, some 
of which were previously incurable."
"In this context, the Group places a particular focus on innovations that 
make it possible to increase the safety, speed, and efficiency of the development and production process for 
such active ingredients."
"This allows new therapies to be made available earlier, at lower prices and to a larger 
number of patients."
"The company’s purpose therefore involves contributing to people’s health and well-being 
and thus to the achievement of global sustainability goals."
"Sustainability Ambition and Strategy 
As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, Sartorius is committed to complying with certain social 
and environmental standards when conducting its business activities."
"The aim is to identify and assess adverse 
impacts that are arising or may arise throughout the upstream and downstream value chain as a result of 
business operations and, based on this, to prevent or mitigate significant adverse impacts and provide 
remediation where they occur."
"The addition of sustainability aspects as a new element of corporate 
management is a long-term transformation and requires ongoing dialogue, coordination and close 
collaboration with relevant stakeholders along the value chain."
"The company’s key stakeholders principally include customers and business partners, employees, investors 
and local residents near Sartorius sites."
"Particularly in the case of customers, Sartorius uses a range of formats 
to remain in constant dialogue regarding sustainability aspects of products, decarbonization and climate 
neutrality, and other environmental and social standards."
"Employees, investors and suppliers are regularly 
informed about relevant sustainability targets, measures and results."
"Sartorius was in constant discussion with 
analysts and investors in the reporting year as part of its regular capital market communication and SRI 
conferences."
"A virtual capital market tutorial also took place, focused on the company’s decarbonization 
strategies and measures."
The sustainability strategy was discussed with selected suppliers at a supplier day.
"In 
addition, Sartorius is involved in industry associations such as BioPhorum, NIMBL and PSCI on sustainability-
related topics and actively shapes industry initiatives."
"The Executive Board 
adopts the sustainability strategy and, together with the Supervisory Board, monitors its implementation, the 
achievement of targets, and the effectiveness of the company’s sustainability-related due diligence system."
"The Group function Corporate Sustainability, whose management reports directly to the Executive Board 
Chairman, is responsible for developing the sustainability strategy and for operational implementation of 
measures to fulfill sustainability guidelines and standards in the Group."
"Other tasks include monitoring 
regulation, overseeing adherence to corporate due diligence requirements and sustainability reporting."
Responsibility for implementing the strategy and the measures it contains lies with the divisions.
"Committees 
to coordinate and implement sustainability measures were established in both divisions during the reporting 
year."
"In view 
of the introduction of European sustainability reporting standards, Sartorius is enhancing its reporting and 
internal control system to further increase data quality."
Risks are identified through the central risk management system.
"Information on risks can be found in the 
Opportunity and Risk Report on page 73 et seq."
"No risks within the meaning of Section 289c(3) were identified 
in fiscal year 2023."
"External Sustainability Performance Ratings and Capital Market Indices  
Sartorius AG and the subgroup Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"are regularly analyzed and evaluated with regard 
to their sustainability performance."

"However, 
Sartorius regards climate change mitigation as a task for the whole of society and therefore as a material topic 
for sustainability management."
"This also involves reducing or avoiding the potential risks of climate change for 
the company itself."
The company is aiming to make its business activities net climate neutral by 2045.
"This is 
to be achieved through continuous decarbonization along the value chain and the removing of unavoidable 
residual emissions in line with the Paris Agreement."
"Concept and Due Diligence Processes  
In fiscal 2021, the Group set itself the target of reducing CO2eq emission intensity by an average of 10% per 
year by 2030 in comparison with the base year 2019."
"Sartorius defines this indicator as adjusted greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions by market-based calculation per net turnover in g CO2eq/€ based on the Accounting 
and Reporting Standards of the GHG Protocol."
"It includes Scope 1, 2 and 3 under the GHG Protocol."
"The 
adjustment means that in the “Purchased goods and services” GHG category it accounts only for the goods 
and services actually consumed for the manufacture of Sartorius’ products and services sold during the fiscal 
year."
"This indicator forms part of the long-term variable remuneration components for the Executive Board 
and management."
"The Group has also set a target of cutting its avoidable, energy consumption-related gross Scope 1 and 2 
emissions to zero by 2030."
"The targets are due to be 
submitted to the SBTi by October 2025."
"Sartorius

Sartorius already identified a range of decarbonization levers along the value chain back in 2021."
"These 
particularly include product design, the associated energy efficiency and selection of materials, and the 
Group’s transport activities."
The company is currently working on a concrete transition plan.
"As a first step, it 
was decided in the reporting year to switch all electricity consumption to renewable sources by 2030."
"Results of the Concept 
GHG balance sheet 
Total gross GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) according to a market-based calculation amounted to 898,898 
t CO2eq in fiscal 2023 (previous year: 1,137,703 t CO2eq; base year: 573,539 t CO2eq)."
"This represents a 
reduction of 21.2% compared with the prior year and an increase of 56.4% compared with the 2019 base year."
"The bulk of the emissions (currently around 96%) result from activities associated with the upstream and 
downstream value chain (Scope 3)."
"Approximately 68% are attributable to the upstream value chain and 
approximately 27% to the downstream value chain."
"The year-on-year reduction in gross GHG emissions was 
due in particular to purchasing- and transport-related GHG emissions (purchased goods and  services, 
upstream transportation and distribution and downstream transportation and distribution), which fell by 38.9% 
and 42.8% respectively."
"This is explained by a decline in operating expenditures for production-related goods 
and services as well as a more precise reporting system in fiscal year 2023."
Capital goods are one of the largest drivers of total GHG emissions.
"The GHG emissions resulting from 
investment in capital goods increased sharply in comparison with the prior year (approximately 76.4%) and 
base year (approximately 356.7%)."
This was related particularly to the Group's increased construction activities.
The increase versus the prior year is also attributable to a more precise reporting system.
"Emissions from 
investment in capital goods have therefore developed since 2019 from the fourth-largest into the third-largest 
contributor to total emissions."
"Gross Scope 1 GHG emissions amounted to 13,103 t CO2eq (previous year: 17,939 t CO2eq, base year: 13,529 t 
CO2eq), equal to a fall of 27.0% compared with the previous year and 3.1% compared with the base year."
"Gross 
Scope 2 GHG emissions by market-based calculation amounted to 26,823 t CO2eq (previous year: 28,714 t 
CO2eq, base year: 25,777 t CO2eq), equal to a decrease of 6.6% compared with the previous year and an 
increase of 4.1% compared with the base year."
"The year-on-year changes were attributable in particular to the 
slightly reduced total energy consumption and the associated reduction in fossil fuels (see the “Energy 
Consumption” section)."
"Total gross GHG emissions were equal to total net GHG emissions in the 2023 reporting year, as no negative 
GHG emissions (carbon removal) could be offset."
"Carbon removal is an important GHG neutralization 
measure under the Paris Agreement."
"It involves permanently removing GHG emissions from the atmosphere 
using biological, chemical and physical methods."
"GHG intensity by market-based calculation, defined as gross GHG emissions per net turnover, amounted to 
0.000264 t CO2eq/€ (previous year: 0.000273 t CO2eq/€, base year: 0.000314 t CO2eq/€)."
"This represents 
a reduction of 3.3% compared with the prior year and 15.7% compared with the 2019 base year."
"Various factors 
affected the change in intensity."
Both GHG emissions and turnover were lower than in the previous year.
"The data, and particularly the figures for individual categories, should currently be seen 
merely as an indication with respect to Scope 3 emissions."

and calculation methods applied, can be found on page 139 et seq."

8 The figure for 2023 is not fully comparable with the prior-year figures, since the basis for calculation was expanded for 2023 and 
now extends to total capital expenditures."
"As a result of materiality analyses for total GHG emissions, the prior-year figures have not 
been adjusted."
"9 Excluding GHG emissions from commuting by trainees, interns and contingent workers."
11 GHG accounting currently covers only products that require electricity to use.
"CO2 Emission Intensity 
In fiscal year 2023, CO2 emission intensity, defined as adjusted GHG intensity (i.e."
"gross GHG emissions per 
net turnover – market-based calculation), amounted to 272 g CO2eq/€ (previous year: 256 g CO2eq/€; base 
year: 308 g CO2eq/€)."
"This represents a 6.3% increase over the prior year and an 11.4% reduction from the base 
year."
The changes were due to stock movements.
"The average annual reduction in CO2eq emission intensity 
from the base year therefore amounted to 3.1% in the reporting year."

"1 For “adjusted GHG intensity: gross GHG emissions per net turnover – market-based calculation,” the GHG category “Purchased 
goods and services” accounts only for the goods and services actually consumed for the manufacture of Sartorius’ products and 
services sold during the fiscal year."
The data are therefore adjusted for inventories.
"Energy Consumption 
Total energy consumption fell by 2.2% to 196,403 MWh in fiscal 2023 (previous year: 200,715 MWh) and was 
therefore on a level with the prior year."
"The share of renewable energy increased by just under four percentage 
points to 35.5% (previous year: 31.7%)."
"This is explained particularly by the lower total energy consumption and 
associated reduction in fossil fuels."
Two locations switched to renewable energy.
"The Bangalore site now draws 
electricity from renewable sources, and the Göttingen site uses geothermal heating."
"The Group-wide degree 
of coverage with certified energy management systems in accordance with ISO 50001 as of December 31, 
measured against the number of employees, stood at 27.0% (previous year: 27.1%), putting it on a level with the 
prior year."

"Materials and Circularity 
Ambition 
Sartorius sources a wide range of raw materials, consumables and supplies in order to manufacture its products 
and product packaging."
"This includes, in particular, plastic, metal and electronic components as well as 
chemicals."
"The aim of a circular economy is to decouple economic growth from environmental impacts by 
recycling materials, i.e."
"not only reducing the consumption of resources but also simultaneously reducing the 
generation of waste, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions."
"The company’s aspiration formulated in 2023 is 
to minimize the disposal of recyclable waste and optimize resource use along the value chain."
"Concept and Due Diligence Processes  
Given their advantages for efficiency, flexibility and patient safety, single-use products made from plastic 
based primarily on fossil resources have become established in the biopharmaceutical industry."
"Examples 
include sterile filters, bags and tubes."
"Single-use products currently contribute around 60 -70% of Group sales 
revenue and are the focus of the current business strategy."
"By law, these products normally have to be 
incinerated as contaminated waste at the end of their life."
"For this reason, and given the high quality standards 
for medical products, closed-loop operations pose significant challenges to the industry and to Sartorius."
"To achieve the best-possible market acceptance for a circular portfolio, Sartorius is in dialogue with its 
customers and is involved in industry associations such as BioPhorum and BPSA."
"Compared with other 
industries, the plastic waste generated by biopharmaceutical products has a lower volume, meaning that the 
economic and environmental aspects of a disposal infrastructure need to be balanced."
"Despite the challenges that exist, Sartorius sees potential to improve resource use along the value chain."
"This includes product 
and transport packaging."
"The principles of circular design include promoting longer durability, reusability, 
repairability, disassembly, (re)processing, recycling, the return of materials to the biological cycle, and other 
ways of improving the use of the product or material based on the circular economy."
A detailed implementation plan is currently being worked out.
"The company will start by driving the creation 
of Group-wide data transparency around resource flows."
"A multi-year master data program was launched in 
the reporting year to initiate the first steps toward accounting for the inflow and outflow of resources at the 
company."
"Sustainability experts in the 
operating divisions began these analyses in the reporting year, focusing on particularly relevant products and 
product groups."
Operational waste is to be avoided right from the production process by reducing or reusing scraps.
"This 
primarily applies to bag, membrane and filter cartridge production."
"The relevant sites have established an 
operational waste management system for this purpose."
"The Executive Board adopted a target in the 
reporting year of sending zero operational waste to landfill by 2030."

Overview of Circularity Targets at Sartorius 
 
 
 
 
 
Results of the Concept 
The total volume of waste generated fell by 46.2% to 10,003 t (previous year: 18,581 t)."
"This was due to a 
particular effect at the Yauco site in Puerto Rico."
"In the previous year, the site arranged for the disposal of large 
volumes of stored wastewater, which therefore no longer counted toward the reporting year figure."
"The 
volume of waste classified as hazardous under local legislation fell by 40.9% to 2,121 t (previous year: 3,593 t)."
Hazardous waste is primarily generated in membrane production due to the use of solvents.
"The change in this 
figure was primarily attributable to a production-related decrease in Yauco and in Göttingen, Germany."
"In 
Yauco, hazardous waste was also reduced by expanding the operation of the distillation plant."
"The proportion 
of non-recycled waste was 53.8% (previous year: n.a.)."
"The total waste recycling rate therefore came to 46.2% 
(previous year: 28.8%), representing a year-on-year increase."
"This development was also related to the 
particular effect in Yauco mentioned above, which resulted in an increased total waste volume and therefore 
a lower recycling rate in the previous year."
Plastic waste represents 12% of the total waste volume.
"It declined by 43.8% to 1,188 t (previous year: 2,113 t)."
The plastic recycling rate fell by 6.5 percentage points to 68.9% (previous year: 75.4%).
"This trend resulted from 
lower production and therefore a reduced volume of plastic waste."
"The Aubagne site in France accounted for 
the largest share of the reduction."

Water and Wastewater 
Ambition 
At Sartorius, water is primarily used in the Bioprocess Solutions Division for membrane production and 
modification."
"The manufacturing processes for membranes and membrane products are optimized to 
minimize the use of rinsing water."
"Organic solvents are processed and for the most part, recycled."
"The goal is 
to ensure compliance with applicable regulations during the use and handling of hazardous materials and to 
continuously improve recycling rates and the management of solvent residues in wastewater."
"The company 
aims to avoid the use of critical substances when developing new products."
"Concept and Due Diligence Processes  
At the membrane-production sites in Göttingen, Germany, and Yauco, Puerto Rico, distillation plants are 
operated that enable almost full recycling of solvents from the production process for own reuse."
"For solvents 
not recycled in this process, the disposal by external service providers is arranged."
"Production wastewater is 
pre-treated in line with legal thresholds and discharged into the sewage system or processed further by 
external service providers."
EHS managers at the sites are responsible for local environmental management.
"Within the framework of the 
local environmental management systems, the company regularly identifies and analyzes environmental 
aspects in order to draw up improvement measures."
"Results of the Concept 
Water withdrawals for fiscal 2023 totaled 699,562 m3 (previous year: 701,568 m3) and therefore remained 
steady with the prior year."
"There were multiple contributory effects, resulting for example from new 
acquisitions, declines in production and increased reporting, which canceled each other out."
"The bulk of total 
water withdrawal (96.0%) came from public water supplies (previous year: 95.9%)."
"A steady share of 12.9% of 
total water withdrawal came from water stress areas (previous year: 12.7%)."
"The prior-year figure has been 
adjusted from 67.6% down to 12.7% due to new classifications by the World Resources Institute."
"As of December 31, the degree of coverage with certified environmental management systems in accordance 
with ISO 14001, measured against the number of employees, stood at 50.6% (previous year: 53.6%)."

Social Responsibility 
Ambition 
In light of the Group's intended development and in the context of demographic change, Sartorius needs to 
recruit and retain talented employees."
"To this end, creating an attractive, fair and safe working environment is 
key."
"As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, the Group is committed to respecting fundamental human 
rights within its own sphere of influence."
"Concept and Due Diligence Processes  
Human Rights and Labor Standards 
The Group has made a policy statement on respect for human rights and a position statement on labor and 
social standards and occupational health and safety available to all employees worldwide on the intranet."
"The 
Sartorius Code of Conduct sets binding minimum standards for law-abiding and ethical conduct throughout 
the Group, which also include Group-wide labor standards."
Implementation of these labor standards is overseen by various functions at different levels at Sartorius.
"For 
example, the Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Department coordinates the global concepts in the field 
of occupational health and safety."
"Individual sites have also introduced specific management systems in 
accordance with ISO 45001."
"The company monitors compliance with the provisions of the Code as part of its compliance management 
system, for example through regular internal audits by the Group Auditing Department."
"Once a year, a report 
is submitted to the responsible Supervisory Board committee."
"Further information on the compliance 
management system can be found in the corporate governance statement on page 96 et seq."
"Compliance with the human rights requirements set out in the Sartorius Code of Conduct is also verified by 
external audits performed by an accredited organization in accordance with the standards of the 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI)."
"The PSCI has established itself as an initiative in the 
pharmaceutical industry to promote sustainability throughout the value chain."
"In a rolling process, five sites 
selected on the basis of risk are chosen for audit each year."
"Employees also have the ability to report human rights and labor standards violations at any time to the 
appropriate manager, employee representatives, compliance officer, or via the compliance or whistleblower 
hotline as well as anonymously via the whistleblower portal."
"Diversity  
As a signatory to the Diversity Charter, Sartorius is committed to promoting workforce diversity beyond these 
basic labor standards."
"Company-wide networks have been established in this context, such as an LGBTQ 
Alliance and the Sartorius Business Women Association (SBWA) to achieve gender parity in management 
positions."
"Sartorius

Employability 
Sartorius is committed to promoting its employees’ ongoing personal and professional development and has 
also enshrined this in its management guidelines."
"Annual performance reviews between employees and their managers provide a forum for discussing 
performance, targets and individual development opportunities."
"The company offers a wide range of training 
opportunities across the Group, such as management development and mentoring programs, self-learning 
opportunities, and also opportunities to work abroad."
"Satisfaction  
Within the framework of a global employee survey conducted twice a year, the Group regularly determines its 
employees’ overall opinion of the company and its leadership culture, the workplace, and job satisfaction in 
general, for example."
"The employee net promoter score, which measures the extent to which employees would recommend 
Sartorius as an employer, forms part of the short-term variable remuneration components for the Executive 
Board and management."
Sartorius has set itself the goal of achieving an average annual score of 35.
"Results of the Concept 
In fiscal 2023, Sartorius had a total of 14,614 employees, 8.3% fewer than in the previous year (15,942)."
"Sartorius 
had increased headcount in previous years in connection with the significant growth in sales revenue."
"However, it adjusted the size of the workforce during the reporting period in response to the changing 
demand levels and reduced capacity requirement."
"Similarly to the prior year, 38.7% of the workforce were 
women (previous year: 38.9%) and the majority of employees were between the ages of 30 and 49, accounting 
for 61.7% of the workforce (previous year: 58.8%)."
"The average age and length of employment were almost 
unchanged from the previous year, at 40.2 years (previous year: 39.2) and 7.5 years (previous year: 6.6), 
respectively."
"A total of 4.7% of employees worked part-time, a similar figure to the previous year (5.6%)."
"In fiscal 2023, five external sustainability-related site audits were carried out in accordance with PSCI 
standards."
The percentage of employees covered by these site audits stood at 17.1% (previous year: 38.5%).
Four of the audits assessed compliance with human rights aspects.
This corresponded to a coverage of 10.4%.
"In both cases, the lower percentage of total employees covered was due to the fact that three sites belonging 
to a single company were audited."
"In the previous year, the audits took place at different companies."
Certified occupational safety management systems covered 6.6% of employees (previous year: 6.9%).
"Across 
the Group, 4.5 work-related injuries occurred per million hours worked (previous year: 5.8)."
"This means that 1.3 
fewer injuries occurred per million hours worked than in the previous year."
"The number of work-related injuries 
is subject to normal variation and partly outside of Sartorius’ control."
"Three work-related injuries with serious 
consequences were documented in fiscal 2023 (previous year: 3)."
"These are defined as work-related injuries 
that cause, or are likely to cause, more than six months of lost time."
"As in the prior year, none of the work-related 
injuries were fatal (previous year: 0)."
"Training hours totaled 276,758 hours (previous year: 232,699), an increase of 18.9%."
"This equated to an average 
of 19.4 training hours per employee, which was also higher than the previous year’s figure (14.8 hours)."
Increased use of digital training opportunities contributed to this.
"The fluctuation rate increased to 14.0% (previous year: 9.2%), and the new hires rate decreased to 5.9% 
(previous year: 22.9%)."
"The higher fluctuation rate was due to targeted programs to adjust the personnel 
requirements to changing demand."
The reduced capacity requirement resulted in a lower rate of new hires.

The employee net promoter score for the year stood at 3.1 on average, a significant drop from the previous

"The annual target of 35, which is relevant for remuneration purposes, was therefore not achieved."
"Various human resources measures had to be taken in 2023 (see also the explanations below regarding the 
fluctuation rate and rate of new hires) in response to the changed market dynamics."
"Designed to ensure the 
company’s long-term profitability, these measures are having a short-term impact on the main drivers of the

"4 This figure includes all work-related injuries that go beyond requiring basic first aid, i.e., requiring a visit to the doctor."
"It does not 
include commuting injuries."

7 Serious work-related injuries are those that have caused or will cause more than 6 months of lost time."
8 Relates only to companies that were fully consolidated for the full year.
"9 The fluctuation includes voluntary, neutral and involuntary departures from the Group."
"It does not include exits due to temporary 
contracts or moves to other parts of the Group."
"10 The figures for new hires solely include the hiring of employees who did not previously have a contract with a Sartorius company as 
well as the conversion of contracts of trainees and contingent workers to permanent employment."
"Concept and Due Diligence Processes  
Corporate governance is based on the requirements defined in the German Stock Corporation Act 
(“Aktiengesetz”) and the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code."
"The corporate governance 
statement and declaration of compliance can be found on page 96 et seq."
"Through its Group-wide compliance management system, Sartorius aims to ensure that board members, 
executives and employees comply with all legal regulations and codes and perform their activities in 
accordance with the company’s internal guidelines."
"A Compliance Management Manual was introduced in 
the reporting year, summarizing the responsibilities and authority of individual functions and setting out the 
processes for efficient collaboration between them."
"The basic principles of the compliance management 
system are explained in the corporate governance statement on page 96 et seq."
The issue of anti-corruption is also a central component of the compliance management system.
"The related 
requirements employees must comply with are laid out in a dedicated Anti-Corruption Code, and employees 
regularly receive training focused specifically on the Code’s contents."
"Results of the Concept 
In fiscal 2023, 11,570 employees (previous year: 11,883 employees) completed the Code of Conduct training 
and 11,490 employees (previous year: 12,154 employees) completed the Anti-Corruption Code training."
"This 
represents 81.1% and 80.5% of the total employees, respectively (previous year: 75.6% and 77.4%)."
"The higher 
percentage is due to the lower total number of employees."

Sustainability in the Supply Chain 
Ambition 
Sartorius expects its suppliers to follow and promote sustainability standards and to require the same of their 
own suppliers."
"This Code of Conduct has been binding for new suppliers since 2022 and should also be signed by existing 
suppliers."
"A standardized, multi-stage process is in place to assess supplier sustainability."
"This is based on internal and 
external information and requires corrective measures to be taken in the event of non-compliance."
"In the 
Bioprocess Solutions Division, a risk committee has been set up, which receives regular reports on the results 
and decides on the action to be taken."
"The supplier evaluation process involves reviewing compliance with sustainability requirements using self-
assessments based on standardized questionnaires via recognized providers."
"For selected suppliers, Sartorius 
engages external, independent on-site sustainability audits by external third parties."
"Furthermore, 
sustainability aspects form part of the on-site quality audits conducted by Sartorius itself."
"The purchasing departments are responsible for ensuring that the Code of Conduct for Suppliers is binding 
and for verifying compliance with the requirements."
"The quality departments are responsible for carrying out 
the quality audits."
"In addition, Sartorius maintains a continuous dialogue with suppliers to promote their commitment to 
sustainability issues."
"Results of the Concept 
In November 2023, the Bioprocess Solutions Division held a workshop with almost 20 selected international 
suppliers at its main site in Göttingen."
"Among other issues, the participants discussed the topics of climate 
change mitigation and the implementation of Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) so as to 
make further progress in these areas."
"As of December 31, 2023, 2,675 suppliers had signed the Sartorius Code of Conduct (previous year: 441)."
"This 
number includes all documents newly signed since October 1, 2022, which largely relate to the updated Code 
of Conduct from 2022 and in some cases to the previous Code of Conduct from 2019 and mutual recognition 
of equivalent codes of conduct."
This equated to a 45% coverage of the purchasing volume (previous year: 12%).
Signing of the Code of Conduct was accelerated in the reporting year.
"In addition, the company has received 
a total of 1,779 valid sustainability-related supplier self-assessments (previous year: 654)."
"This equated to 51% 
coverage of the purchasing volume, a similar figure to the previous year (49%)."
"Furthermore, the company carried out 62 of its own quality-related supplier audits, which included 
sustainability aspects (previous year: 125)."
"This was 50% fewer than in the previous year, since the suppliers 
undergoing an audit were selected for the first time via a risk-based method using the results of the 
sustainability assessment process described above."
"In the reporting year, as in the previous year, no external 
sustainability audits were yet carried out at any suppliers’ sites."
"The initial focus was instead on other aspects 
of the due diligence system described above."

"The EU taxonomy is a classification system for determining environmentally sustainable economic activities in 
the real economy, combined with specific disclosure requirements for companies."
"For the first time, companies are required for fiscal year 2023 to disclose taxonomy-eligible turnover, capital 
expenditures and operating expenditures for all environmental objectives."
"In this context, the economic 
activities described in the Delegated Acts are considered to be taxonomy-eligible, as they make a substantial 
contribution to the achievement of the EU’s environmental objectives."
"In accordance with the simplified 
procedure, taxonomy alignment continues to be disclosed only for the environmental objectives of climate 
change mitigation and climate change adaptation."
"Economic activities that meet the technical screening 
criteria and the minimum safeguards criteria are considered to be taxonomy-aligned."
"The company has taken information into 
account that was available through January 31, 2024."
"Materiality approach 
Capital expenditures and operating expenditures in category c were reported on the basis of materiality 
thresholds."
"Economic activities comprising less than 1% of the total taxonomy-eligible capital and operating 
expenditures were reported as non-taxonomy-eligible and therefore not assessed for taxonomy alignment."
"The 
corresponding template can be found in the “Annex to the Key Performance Indicators under the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation” section."
"The results are each described in the following sections on taxonomy-aligned 
turnover, capital expenditures, and operating expenditures, respectively."
"The results are described in 
each of the following sections."
"Responsibility for tax compliance generally lies with the local 
management of the individual Group companies."
"These are supported by both local tax 
consulting firms and the central Group Tax Department."
"A system of various measures, such as 
monitoring local regulations (filing deadlines, tax rates, etc.) and tax risks, ensures that information 
is collected within the Group and reported to the Executive Board accordingly."
"▪ Corruption and Bribery: The Group refers to the existing Group-wide compliance management 
system, which is described in the “Corporate Governance Report” section of this Annual Report 
starting on page 96 et seq."
"▪ Fair Competition: The Group refers to the existing Group-wide compliance management system, 
which is described in the “Corporate Governance Report” section of this Annual Report starting 
on page 96 et seq."
"Sartorius’ human 
rights due diligence system does not extend to customer relationships, as the Group has not 
identified any relevant areas of risk stemming from its products and services."
"Since the taxonomy-
aligned capital expenditures and operating expenditures reported below for fiscal 2023 relate to 
Germany, Sartorius has assessed and determined the effectiveness of the system exclusively 
within this framework."
"Avoiding Double Counting  
With legislation having expanded the list of taxonomy-eligible economic activities, Sartorius is required to 
report on taxonomy-eligible turnover for the first time in fiscal year 2023."
"Since this relates exclusively to a 
single environmental objective – transition to a circular economy – rather than to multiple environmental 
objectives, the possibility of double counting in turnover reporting is ruled out."
"In the reporting year, capital and operating expenditures included, for the first time, expenditures related to 
taxonomy-aligned economic activities (category a capital and operating expenditures)."
"These expenditures at 
Sartorius are contributing to the transition to a circular economy."
"Capital and operating expenditures in the 
reporting year also included spending related to the acquisition of products from taxonomy-eligible economic 
activities (category c)."
"Data collection was therefore designed to distinguish between the two types of 
expenditure and avoid double counting in expenditure reporting."

1 As it was not yet mandatory to assess the taxonomy alignment of these activities for fiscal year 2023, no data are yet available."
The legislation expanded the list of taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the reporting year.
"Accordingly, taxonomy-aligned turnover accounted for 0% of total consolidated 
turnover in fiscal 2023 (previous year: 0%)."
"The Delegated Acts on climate change mitigation and climate 
change adaptation applicable to these objectives currently address only particularly climate-relevant 
economic activities, with which the Group does not generate any sales revenue."
"Capital Expenditures for Taxonomy-Eligible and Taxonomy-Aligned Economic Activities  
Capital expenditures in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation consisted of gross additions to tangible 
and intangible fixed assets in the reporting year, including additions from business acquisitions."
"In this context, 
goodwill is not taken into account."
"Capital expenditures were measured on the basis of the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable to the consolidated financial statements."
"Capital 
expenditures correspond to the sum of the amounts recognized in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements from investment and additions from acquisitions which are presented in the sections “15."
"Other 
intangible assets” on page 206, “16."
"Property, plant and equipment” on page 209 et seq., and “17."
"Leases” on 
page 210 et seq."
"In relation to taxonomy-eligible turnover, Sartorius calculated category a capital expenditures in the 
reporting year for the first time."
There are currently no category b capital expenditures – i.e.
"that are part of a 
plan to expand taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to transform taxonomy-eligible into taxonomy-
aligned economic activities (“CapEx plan”)."
"Accordingly, there was no assessment of compliance with the 
technical screening criteria for category a capital expenditures in fiscal 2023."
"This means that the company has met key EU taxonomy 
criteria, for example with regard to CO2 emissions."
"Sartorius could not, however, provide full evidence that 
other requirements, including the mandatory EU tire labels, had been met."
"With respect to Activity 7.7, compliance with the technical screening criteria could only be determined for the 
company’s buildings in Germany."
"This assessment was carried out on the basis of existing and planned 
certifications by the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB) and energy performance certificates, 
among other data."
"Sartorius was able to successfully evaluate the SC and DNSH criteria for most of the 
buildings in Germany."
"As such, taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures accounted for 5% of all capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 
(previous year: 13%) and have therefore fallen year on year."
"This was attributable in particular to the acquisition 
of Polyplus (see the Business Combinations section on pages 197), which significantly increased total capital 
expenditures as the denominator and therefore reduced the relative share of the taxonomy-aligned 
expenditure."
Lower investment in buildings compared with the previous year also played a role.
"In relation to taxonomy-eligible turnover, Sartorius calculated category a operating expenditures in the 
reporting year for the first time."
There are currently no category b operating expenditures.
"At Sartorius, these only include the costs associated with renovating and maintaining 
buildings."
"As such, taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures accounted for 2% of all operating expenditures in fiscal 
2023 (previous year: 1%)."

Operational control was selected as the consolidation approach.
"Data Concepts  
The data concepts used in fiscal 2023 are described in more detail below for each GHG category."
"These 
concepts were unchanged from the previous year."
"Scope 1  
Fuel consumption and fugitive emissions for solvents and refrigerants were multiplied by a specific emission 
factor."
"Scope 2 
The consumption of electricity, heating, and cooling was multiplied by a specific emission factor."
"Scope 3 
▪ Category 1: “Purchased goods and services” 
▪ The weight or grouped operating expenditures for purchased goods and services was multiplied 
by a specific emission factor."
"This means that the data have been 
adjusted for warehouse inventories."
"▪ Category 2: “Capital goods” 
The grouped capital expenditures for goods and services were multiplied by a specific emission 
factor."
"▪ Category 3: “Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 and 2)” 
The fuel and energy consumption used to calculate Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions was each 
multiplied by specific emission factors."
"▪ Category 4: “Upstream transportation and distribution” 
GHG emissions reported by the largest carriers were accounted for and logistics expenditures 
not covered by this method were multiplied by an average spend-based emission factor."
"Sartorius 
Combined Group Management Report    Non-financial Group Statement 
 
140 
 
 
Start 
 
▪ Category 5: “Waste generated in operations” 
The amount of waste generated was multiplied by emission factors specific to each material and 
method of disposal."
"▪ Category 6: “Business travel” 
The recorded train, airplane, and rental car routes as well as the number of nights spent in hotels 
were each multiplied by specific emission factors."
"Routes and nights spent in hotels that were 
not recorded were estimated in each case and also multiplied by a specific emission factor."
"▪ Category 7: “Employee commuting” 
The average distance employees commuted per day was extrapolated based on the number of 
employees and scaled using on-site attendance days and estimated work weeks, and the result 
was multiplied by emission factors specific to each method of transportation."
"▪ Category 8: “Upstream leased assets” 
No GHG emissions (0 t CO2eq) are reported in the category “Upstream leased assets” because 
energy consumption is fully controlled by Sartorius and the corresponding emissions are 
therefore already presented in Scope 1 and 2."
"▪ Category 11: “Use of sold products” 
Turnover generated with energy-consuming product groups was multiplied by specific energy 
factors determined on the basis of representative products."
"The resulting total energy 
consumption of the products sold was multiplied by a global emission factor for electricity."
"▪ Category 12: “End-of-life treatment of sold products” 
Sartorius applied the global disposal method mix to the estimated weight of products sold (see 
the “What a waste 2.0” study, 2018 World Bank Report) and multiplied each by emission factors 
specific to the material and the disposal method."
"▪ Category 14: “Franchises” 
No GHG emissions (0 t CO2eq) are reported in the “Franchises” category because Sartorius 
does not currently distribute its products through franchises."
"Emission Factors  
Emission factors from various external providers and databases were used for GHG accounting, as were self-
calculated average factors."
"The providers, databases and self-calculated average factors were unchanged 
from the previous year."
"Additional Remarks 
Sartorius currently treats the GHG emissions calculated using the data concepts described above as merely an 
indication, since they are largely based on modeling that involves various assumptions and estimates."
"The 
accuracy of GHG accounting will be gradually improved further in the coming years so as to enable better 
management of emissions."
"In the Non-Financial Statement Sartorius refers to the corporate governance statement and the declaration 
of compliance."
"The adequacy of these declarations and the accuracy of the conclusions drawn therefrom were 
not part of our limited assurance engagement."
"As presented in the non-financial Group statement, supplier audits of production facilities were carried out in 
2023 as part of the quality audits by Sartorius AG to monitor compliance with environmental, social and health 
standards."
Sartorius AG and the Stedim Biotech S.A.
"subgroup were assessed in sustainability ratings, as presented in the 
non-financial statement."
"The appropriateness and accuracy of the conclusions drawn from the respective quality audit activities 
performed and the appropriateness and accuracy of the analyses and assessments underlying the 
sustainability ratings were not part of our audit."
"This responsibility of the legal representatives includes the selection and application of appropriate methods 
to prepare the Non-Financial Statement and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual disclosures 
which are reasonable under the given circumstances."
"Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible 
for such internal control as they consider necessary to enable the preparation of the Non-Financial Statement 
in a way that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipulation of the Non-Financial 
Statement) or error."

subject to substantial uncertainties regarding their interpretation and for which not all clarifications have been

"They are

"Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted 
differently; the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties."
"Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the Non-Financial Statement based on 
our assurance engagement."
"We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information” issued by the IAASB."
"In a limited assurance engagement the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable 
assurance engagement and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained."
"The selection of 
the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the assurance practitioner."
"In the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following assurance 
procedures and other activities: 
▪ 
Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the Group's sustainability organization and

"Main Features of the Remuneration Policy for the 
Executive Board 
A."
"Main Features of the Remuneration Policy and Contribution Toward 
Promoting the Corporate Strategy and Long-Term Development of the 
Company 
The remuneration policy for the Executive Board was revised by the Supervisory Board and approved by the 
Annual General Meeting on March 29, 2023."
"It aims to remunerate the members of the Executive Board 
appropriately in line with their tasks and responsibilities and to directly consider the performance of each 
member of the Executive Board and the success of the company."
"For this reason, the remuneration policy 
includes both short-term and long-term variable remuneration components in addition to fixed remuneration 
components."
"The company strategy seeks to achieve profitable growth and a sustained, long-term increase in the value of 
the company."
"This strategy is the basis from which the structure of the remuneration policy is derived for the 
Executive Board of Sartorius AG: The short-term variable remuneration depends on annual corporate targets 
that are aligned with key performance indicators for profitable growth of the company."
"Long-term 
remuneration is based on corporate objectives that reflect the sustainable long-term growth of the Group and 
the long-term performance of the share price, which directly mirrors the development of the company’s value."
"As a result, the company’s remuneration policy creates incentives to promote the long-term and positive 
sustainable development of the company."
"The policy for remuneration of the Executive Board members is designed to be simple, clear and 
understandable."
"The existing divergences in the reporting year 
from the recommendations of the applicable GCGC in the area of remuneration are given below."

"Remuneration Components 
1."
"Overview of the Individual Remuneration Components 
Remuneration consists of fixed and variable components."
"The fixed components are the fixed annual salary 
and fringe benefits."
"The variable performance-based components are comprised of short-term components 
with a one-year assessment basis and of long-term components with a multi-year assessment basis."
"In 
addition, there are pension commitments, which depend, among other things, on the amount of the own 
contribution made by the respective Executive Board member in the form of deferred compensation for 
variable remuneration components, and which are therefore also variable."
"Fixed Remuneration Components 
a) Fixed Annual Remuneration 
Fixed annual remuneration is cash compensation related to a specific fiscal year, and is based in particular on 
the area of duties and responsibilities of the respective Executive Board member."
"This fixed annual 
remuneration is paid in twelve monthly installments."
"In addition, the company maintains a D&O insurance policy concluded for Executive Board members as 
beneficiaries."
"The respective insurance premiums are not of a remunerative nature and are therefore not 
recognized as salary expenses."
"Sartorius

3."
"Variable Performance-Based Remuneration Components 
a) Short-Term Variable Remuneration with a One-Year Assessment Basis 
In addition to the fixed remuneration components, all Executive Board members are entitled to receive short-
term variable remuneration with a one-year assessment basis."
"These subordinate targets are key control elements for profitable growth as well as for a sustainable and long-
term increase in the value of the company and serve to implement the overarching strategic goals of the 
Group."
"Measurement of Target Achievement and Payment 
For each target parameter, the Supervisory Board has defined a formula that is used to calculate the amount 
to be paid out according to the degree of target achievement for the associated individual component."
"For 
each of these components, the Supervisory Board also sets (i) a minimum target to be achieved below which 
the amount that will be paid out is zero, and (ii) a maximum target to be achieved above which the amount that 
will be paid out will no longer increase."
"Therefore, the amount paid out for each subordinate target is capped 
at the maximum percentage of the individual target amount."
"This cap is currently 120% for all subordinate 
targets."
"For each of the individual components of short-term variable remuneration with a one-year assessment basis, 
the Supervisory Board sets a separate individual target amount for every Executive Board member before the 
beginning of a fiscal year."
"This target amount is used as the basis to determine the specific amount to be paid 
out according to the particular target achievement of the relevant subordinate target for the fiscal year in 
question."
"The targets are weighted for the individual Executive Board members according to their area of 
responsibility and relate to the divisions and/or to the Group, respectively."
"When it comes to the non-financial target parameters, the degree of target achievement 
is determined by comparing the target values set by the Supervisory Board with the respective actual results."
"The Supervisory Board ensures the comparability of target and actual figures by taking account of factors that 
were not included in operational planning."
"In fiscal year 2023, these related to the acquisition of Polyplus, 
which was completed in July 2023."
"Annual short-term variable remuneration is calculated for a fiscal year ended and paid in the following fiscal 
year."
"Target achievement is 100% if the actual 
figure for the average of sales revenue | order intake equals the target amount."
"The minimum target 
achievement is 90% of the target amount, and this amount is capped at 104%."
"If 90% of the target amount is 
achieved, 50% of the associated individual target sum will be paid out; if the target is achieved at less than 90%, 
no payment is rendered for this subordinate target."
"If 104% of the target amount is achieved, an amount equal 
to 120% of the corresponding individual target amount will be paid out; if the target is achieved in excess of 
this percentage, this will not further increase the amount to be paid out."
"Intermediate values are interpolated 
linearly."
"Target achievement is measured on the basis of actual sales and order intake in constant currencies, 
as reported in the company’s consolidated financial statements audited according to the defined audit focal 
points and approved."
"The figures were adjusted for effects from the acquisition of Polyplus during the 
reporting year."
"For fiscal year 2023, the target amount for the Group was €4,106 million."
"The Bioprocess 
Solutions Division had a target of €3,216 million and the Lab Products & Services Division a target of 
€890 million."
"At the Group level, target achievement stood at 
Sartorius 
Remuneration Report    Remuneration Report 
 
151 
 
 
Start 
 
79.62% of the target value, resulting in a payout rate of 0% for the Chairman of the Executive Board and the 
Chief Financial Officer."
"Subordinate Target “Underlying EBITDA” 
The subordinate target “Underlying EBITDA” is a key indicator of the Group’s profitability, which can also be 
used to present the Group’s operating performance in a more comparable way internationally."
"Underlying 
EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted for extraordinary 
effects."
"The target is derived from the budget and is defined by the Supervisory Board for the Group or division, 
respectively."
"Target achievement is 100% if the actual figure for underlying EBITDA equals this defined target 
amount."
"The minimum target achievement is 70% of the target amount, and this amount is capped at 120%."
"The level of the bonus payment is linear to the level of target achievement; i.e., if 70% of the subordinate target 
is achieved, 70% of the related individual target amount will be paid out, or if 120% of the target is achieved, 
120% of the related individual target amount will be paid out."
"If the target is achieved at less than 70%, no 
payment will be made for this subordinate target."
"By contrast, if the target is achieved by 120% or more, this 
will not further increase the amount to be paid out."
"If the target is achieved at less than 70%, no payment will 
be made for this subordinate target."
"By contrast, if the target is achieved by 120% or more, this will not further 
increase the amount to be paid out."
"Target achievement is measured on the basis of the actual underlying 
EBITDA figure, as reported in the company’s consolidated financial statements audited according to the 
defined audit focal points and approved, as well as by taking into account current exchange rates."
"The target 
value for the Group in fiscal year 2023 was €1,448 million."
"The Bioprocess Solutions Division had a target of 
€1,210 million and the Lab Products & Services Division a target of €238 million."

Subordinate Target ""Ratio of Net Debt to Underlying EBITDA"" 
The subordinate target “Ratio of Net Debt to Underlying EBITDA” is a key financial ratio regarding the Group’s 
debt financing capacity."
This ratio is calculated as the quotient of net debt and underlying EBITDA.
"The target 
is derived from the budget and is defined by the Supervisory Board for the Group."
"Target achievement is 100% 
if the actual figure for the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA equals this defined target amount."
"The level 
of the bonus paid lies between 50% and 120% of the respective subordinate target amount."
"If the target ratio 
is reached, the bonus level to be paid is 100%."
"If net debt to underlying EBITDA is above the target ratio, the 
bonus level will decrease proportionately down to 50% if the maximum amount defined by the Supervisory 
Board for the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA is reached."
"If the ratio exceeds this maximum amount, no 
bonus will be paid for this subordinate target."
The target in fiscal year 2023 was 1.43.
"Ratio of Net debt to Underlying EBITDA 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In fiscal 2023, target achievement for the subordinate target “Ratio of Net Debt to Underlying EBITDA” stood 
at 0%, resulting in no payout for this subordinate target."
"Subordinate Target “Employee Net Promoter Score (ENPS)” 
The subordinate target “Employee Net Promoter Score (ENPS)” refers to the non-financial component of 
employee satisfaction."
"The focus is on a high or competitive recommendation rate, which is currently polled 
twice a year within the scope of global employee surveys."
"The target is defined by the Supervisory Board for 
the Group or division, respectively."
"Target achievement is 100% if the actual average ENPS from the two polls 
equals the target amount defined by the Supervisory Board."
"The minimum target achievement is 70% of the 
target amount, and this amount is capped at 120%."
"The level of the bonus payment is linear to the level of 
target achievement; i.e., if 70% of the subordinate target is achieved, 50% of the related individual target 
amount will be paid out, or if 112% of the target is achieved, 120% of the related individual target amount will be 
paid out."
"If the target is achieved at less than 70%, no payment will be made for this subordinate target."
"By 
contrast, if the target is achieved by 112% or more, this will not further increase the amount to be paid out."
Target achievement is measured on the basis of the actual value achieved.
"The Supervisory Board set a target 
of 35 for the Employee Net Promoter Score in fiscal year 2023."
"The aforementioned long-term variable remuneration components are weighted as follows: 25% each for 
consolidated net profit and reduction in CO2 -equivalent emission intensity and 50% for the phantom stock 
plan."
"For each of the individual components, a separate individual target amount is set for each Executive 
Board member, on the basis of which the specific payment amount is determined in each case based on the 
level at which the associated targets were achieved for the relevant fiscal years."
"The Executive Board Chairman Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg was additionally granted share-based compensation 
as a further long-term variable remuneration component."
"The long-term increase in the value of the company 
as an overriding strategic objective of the company is also promoted by this share-based compensation and 
the participation provided by this in the development of the price of the company’s shares."
"The respective 
long-term variable remuneration components together generally represent the majority of the variable 
compensation components for each Executive Board member."
"The “consolidated net profit” and “reduction in CO2 -equivalent emissions intensity” components of long-
term variable remuneration are each weighted at 25%."
"In contrast, the “development of preference share 
price” component of long-term variable remuneration is weighted at 50%."
"As a result, the share-based portion 
of variable remuneration, in deviation from Recommendation G.10, sentence 1 of the GCGC, does not, in 
principle, constitute the predominant portion of Executive Board members’ variable remuneration."
"The 
Sartorius 
Remuneration Report    Remuneration Report

Supervisory Board believes that even with the current weighting, an incentive structure is achieved which is 
geared to the sustainable and long-term development of the company."
"In the case of the Chairman of the 
Executive Board, however, his variable remuneration is predominantly share-based in view of the additional 
share component granted, in line with this Recommendation."
"In the reporting year, the Supervisory Board 
decided in future to make use of the possibility of also providing a share-based component to all members of 
the Executive Board."
"Consolidated Net Profit 
The individual component based on consolidated net profit has an assessment period of four consecutive 
fiscal years (until 2021: three consecutive fiscal years) and begins with the fiscal year in which the tranche in 
question is granted."
A new tranche is granted on a rolling basis for each fiscal year.
"The payout amount for the 
respective tranche is based on the total target achievement for the respective measurement period, which 
corresponds to the average target achievement for each of the four fiscal years of the relevant measurement 
period."
"For each fiscal year, the Supervisory Board annually defines a target for consolidated net profit in euros."
"For 
this component, which is designed to make the calculation more objective, the Supervisory Board in fiscal year 
2023 mainly took into account the acquisition of Polyplus and the funding of this transaction."
"The amount paid out is determined on the basis of the individual target amount and the formula defined by 
the Supervisory Board."
"It establishes (i) a minimum target achievement level of 50%, below which the payout 
is zero, and (ii) a maximum target achievement level, above which the payout amount no longer increases."
"Therefore, the amount paid out for this remuneration target is capped at the maximum percentage of the 
individual target amount."
"This cap currently stands at 120% for all individual target amounts and is reached at 
a target achievement level of 120%."
"This remuneration component is generally paid after the end of the last 
fiscal year of the assessment period for the tranche in question, which was four years for tranches granted in 
the reporting year and three years for tranches granted in previous years."
"This partial payment only still applied to Rainer Lehmann, whose contract 
predates the new remuneration policy coming into effect as it pertains to this component."
"Any overpayment as a result of these partial payments will be offset against other remuneration 
components once the total target achievement level has been determined after the third or fourth fiscal year 
of the relevant assessment period."
"Target achievement for the “consolidated net profit” component for fiscal 2023 stood at 0% of the target 
value."
"For the 2021 to 2023 multi-year assessment period, the target achievement level stands at 90.7%, 
meaning that a payout of 90.7% less the partial payment granted in 2021 will apply for this three-year period."
"The complete target achievement for the multi-year assessment period beginning in 2023 cannot be 
determined until the consolidated financial statements audited and approved for 2026 are available."
"Reduction CO2 -emission intensity 
The individual component related to the reduction in CO2 emission intensity has an assessment period of four 
fiscal years and begins with the fiscal year in which the tranche in question is granted."
"A new tranche is granted 
on a rolling basis for each fiscal year."
"The amount paid out for a particular tranche depends on the individual 
target amount and target achievement for the respective assessment period."
"The Supervisory Board sets a 
target value for each tranche for the reduction in CO2 emission intensity during the assessment period."
"This is 
based on the relevant target value from the company’s sustainability strategy (from the previous year’s audited 
Non-financial Group Statement) and is currently 10% per fiscal year."
"Corrections are made to base effects and recording 
inaccuracies to take into account progress in the quality of available data."
"The amount paid out is determined on the basis of the individual target amount and the formula defined by 
the Supervisory Board."
"It establishes (i) a minimum target achievement level of 50%, below which the payout 
is zero, and (ii) a maximum target achievement level, above which the payout amount no longer increases."
"Therefore, the amount paid out for this remuneration target is capped at the maximum percentage of the 
individual target amount."
This cap stands at 120% and is reached at a target achievement level of 120%.
"This remuneration component is paid out after the end of the fourth fiscal year of the assessment period for 
the tranche in question."
"CO2 emission intensity

Development of the Preference Share Price (Phantom Stock Plan) 
As the third individual component of long-term variable compensation, Executive Board members receive 
virtual shares, known as phantom stock units."
"Through the issue of such phantom shares, Executive Board 
members are treated as if they were owners of a certain number of preference shares in Sartorius AG, without, 
however, being entitled to receive dividends."
"The development of the value of these phantom stocks is linked 
with the development of the Sartorius preference share; both increases and decreases in the share price are 
taken into account."
"Later, the value of these phantom stocks is assessed based on the share price at the time, 
and its equivalent is paid out in cash, provided that the associated conditions are met."
"Phantom stocks cannot 
be traded and do not confer any rights to purchase shares."
"According to the Sartorius phantom stock plan, each Executive Board member is credited at the beginning of 
every year with phantom stock units valued at an agreed monetary value."
"The value of these phantom stocks 
can be paid out only as an entire annual tranche."
"Payment can be requested at the earliest after a period of 
four years and no later than after eight years."
"If a member is appointed to the Executive Board during a year, 
this member will be assigned phantom stock units retroactively as of the beginning of this fiscal year (pro rata 
temporis, if applicable)."
"In addition, the 
value of the phantom stock units must be at least 50% of the grant value."
"The phantom stock plan rules out 
subsequent changes to the parameters used for comparative stock valuation."
"This serves to compensate for any 
short-term fluctuations in the share prices."
"The payout amount is capped at a maximum of 2.5 times the share price at the time the phantom stock units 
were granted, based in each case on the individual annual tranche."
"These 
black-out periods are intended to ensure that payments are only made during periods in which the most 
recent business results have already been processed in the capital market and the regular publication of 
further business results is still sufficiently far in the future."
The fair value grant price for this remuneration component is €356.09 for 2023.
"Target achievement for this 
subordinate target is reported in the remuneration report after vesting or exercise by the Executive Board 
members; i.e., between 2027 and 2031."
"Share-Based Payment 
In December 2019, Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg was additionally granted share-based payment in connection with 
the fourth extension of his appointment as a member and Chairman of the Executive Board as well as CEO."
"This was in the form of company shares with a grant date fair value totaling €5.0 million (based on the share 
price as of December 5, 2019, as the grant date); this corresponds to a pro-rated grant date fair value of 
€1.0 million for each year of his new five-year term of appointment."
"The shares granted are subject to a holding period that will end on November 10, 
2024."
"Should Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg leave the company prior to November 11, 2022, at his own request, his 
entitlements to be granted said shares by transfer shall lapse in their entirety."
"If Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg leaves 
the company after November 10, 2022, and before November 11, 2024, at his own request, half of his 
entitlements to be granted said shares shall lapse."
"For the purpose of the target total remuneration, the shares 
granted for Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg’s current five-year term of appointment are recognized at their pro-rated 
grant date fair value for each year of his term of appointment."
"Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg sold a total of 20,000 
preference shares on November 14, 2022."
"This reported transaction was published on the Sartorius AG 
website."
"Dr. Alexandra Gatzemeyer and Dr. René Fáber were granted share-based remuneration in December 2023 in 
the form of company shares, which were transferred effective January 1, 2024."
"Dr. Alexandra Gatzemeyer was 
granted 1,496 ordinary shares at an exercise price of €234.00 and 1,186 preference shares at an exercise price 
of €295.10 for a contract period of two years and four months."
"The shares granted are subject to a holding 
period that will end on December 31, 2027."
"Should Dr. Alexandra Gatzemeyer leave the company prior to 
December 31, 2024, at her own request, her entitlements to be granted said shares by transfer shall lapse in 
their entirety."
"If Dr. Alexandra Gatzemeyer leaves the company after December 31, 2024, and before April 30, 
2025, at her own request, half of her entitlements to be granted said shares shall lapse."
"Dr. René Fáber was 
granted 1,923 ordinary shares at an exercise price of €234.00 and 1,525 preference shares at an exercise price 
of €295.10 for a contract period of three years."
"The shares granted are subject to a holding period that will end 
on December 31, 2027."
"Should Dr. René Fáber leave the company prior to June 30, 2025, at his own request, 
his entitlements to be granted said shares by transfer shall lapse in their entirety."
"If Dr. René Fáber leaves the 
company after June 30, 2025, and before December 31, 2025, at his own request, half of his entitlements to 
be granted said shares shall lapse."
"Pension Commitments 
The members of the Executive Board generally receive pension commitments as defined-contribution plans 
for their first reappointment."
"At the request of the Executive Board member concerned, the company will take 
out an insurance policy for the term of their employment contract and pay the particular benefit contributions 
into this insurance policy."
"The pension contribution consists of a base amount of 14% of the respective 
member’s annual fixed remuneration."
"If a member of the Executive Board exercises this right, the 
company will in turn make an additional contribution in the same amount (known as a matching contribution 
benefit)."
"The company does not guarantee the paid-in capital or an annual 
interest rate."
"With each full year of service on the 
Executive Board, 5% of his full pension will be vested until his fully vested pension will have been reached after 
20 years."
"In this case, these retirement benefits will have been fully vested, taking his years of service on the 
Executive Board into account, at the end of December 31, 2021."
"These additional pension 
commitments are considered in the determination of Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg’s target total remuneration and 
of the relative proportion of his pension commitments in his target total remuneration along with the 
respective employee benefit expense attributable thereto."
The regular retirement age for all pension commitments is 65.
"There are no early retirement regulations, except 
in the case of disability."
"Other Remuneration Components 
The remuneration policy provides that the Supervisory Board may grant special compensation at its 
reasonable discretion for extraordinary performance by a member of the Executive Board."
"This option was not 
used in the reporting year."
"Target Total Remuneration; Relative Percentages of Fixed and Variable Remuneration Components 
The Supervisory Board determines a specific target total remuneration for each Executive Board member."
"The 
target total remuneration is the sum of all remuneration components relevant for total remuneration."
"For the 
variable components, the target amount is taken as a basis in each case of 100% target achievement, provided 
that a target is measured."
"For the Executive Board Chairman, the relative percentage of fixed remuneration components (fixed annual 
salary and fringe benefits) is roughly 29% and the percentage of the variable remuneration components as a 
whole roughly 62% of his target total remuneration."
"The proportion of short-term (target) compensation in his 
target total remuneration is roughly 17% and that of long-term (target) compensation in his target total 
remuneration roughly 45%."
"Pension commitments for the Executive Board Chairman currently account for 
roughly 9% of his target total remuneration."
"In this context, short-term (target) compensation accounts for 
between roughly 21% and 25% of total target compensation, while long-term (target) compensation accounts 
for between roughly 30% and 35% of total target compensation."
"Pension commitments currently account for 
between 7% and roughly 8% of total target compensation."

The defined relative proportions of the remuneration components correspond in their respective amounts to 
the requirements of the relevant remuneration policy."
"Reclaiming or Reducing Variable Remuneration (Clawback) 
All Executive Board employment contracts contain provisions specifying that the company is entitled to 
reclaim from Executive Board members variable remuneration components already paid out to them in the 
following cases described: 
1."
"The Executive Board member shall not be obligated to reimburse the company if more than three years have 
elapsed as counted from the payment of the respective variable remuneration components up to the time a 
claim against said member for reimbursement is asserted."
"The objection of disenrichment in accordance with 
Section 818, Subsection 3, of the German Civil Code “BGB” is excluded under the remuneration policy."
"The 
right to claim damages pursuant to Section 93 AktG shall remain unaffected."
"Exercise 
In fiscal 2023, none of the conditions for reclaiming or reducing remuneration under these clawback provisions 
existed."
"Accordingly, no use was made of this right to exercise a clawback option."
"Remuneration-Related Legal Transactions 
1."
"Terms and Prerequisites for Termination of Remuneration-Related Legal Transactions 
The employment contracts of Executive Board members are concluded for the term of their respective 
appointments."
"Initial appointments are each for a maximum of three years; extensions of an appointment term 
are for up to five years."
"For this reason, an 
employment contract of an Executive Board member can only be terminated by mutual agreement based on 
a termination agreement or by termination for good cause with immediate effect."
"In this case, the 
statutory periods of notice pursuant to Section 622 of the German Civil Code “BGB” shall apply, unless there 
is also a compelling reason (“good cause”) for termination without notice pursuant to Section 626 of BGB."
Rainer Lehmann and John Gerard Mackay left the Executive Board during the reporting year.
"Rainer Lehmann stepped down from the Executive Board early, effective October 31, 2023."
"The variable 
remuneration for fiscal year 2023 is calculated pro rata temporis, and the payout dates for the variable 
remuneration remain unchanged."
"Phantom stocks granted from previous fiscal years’ tranches will remain and 
will be paid out after vesting or exercise."
No settlement payment was agreed.
"John Gerard Mackay stepped down from the Executive Board early, effective June 15, 2023."
"The calculation 
and payout dates for the variable remuneration for fiscal year 2023 remain unchanged."
"Phantom stocks 
granted from previous fiscal years’ tranches will remain and will be paid out after vesting or exercise."
"No 
settlement payment was agreed."
"The maximum severance payment equals two years’ 
remuneration (including variable components), but no more than the amount of remuneration that would be 
payable until the end of the contract term."
"Non-Competition Clause 
The Executive Board employment contracts provide for a post-contractual non-competition clause for a 
duration of up to two years upon termination of employment with the company."
"In the event that this non-
competition clause is not waived or is nullified, half of the remuneration last paid by the company shall be 
granted to the respective Executive Board member as compensation for non-competition throughout the 
non-competition period."
"Procedure for Establishing, Implementing and Reviewing the Remuneration Policy 
The Supervisory Board establishes and regularly reviews the remuneration policy for the Executive Board."
"The 
Executive Task Committee of the Supervisory Board prepares the remuneration policy for approval by the full 
Supervisory Board and makes the respective suggestions."
"In the process, the Supervisory Board also reviews the appropriateness of such remuneration in comparison 
to the remuneration of the Executive Board within the peer group of the company (horizontal 
appropriateness)."
"The peer group is defined by the Supervisory Board and/or its Executive Task Committee 
Sartorius 
Remuneration Report    Remuneration Report 
 
161 
 
 
Start 
 
and is adapted as necessary."
"In 2022, the Supervisory Board conducted a benchmarking analysis of Executive 
Board remuneration with the assistance of a neutral external remuneration consultant and, in this context, 
reviewed and reconstituted the peer group."
"In determining the composition of the peer group, the Supervisory 
Board identified domestic and foreign companies that are comparable to the company in terms of industry, 
size and sales."
"This updated peer group currently includes the following companies: Beiersdorf, Carl Zeiss 
Meditec, Drägerwerk, Gerresheimer, Qiagen, Symrise, SYNLAB, bioMérieux, Coloplast, Eurofins Scientific, 
Lonza Group, Smith&Nephew, Steris and UCB."
"In establishing the remuneration for the Executive Board members, the Supervisory Board further considers 
both the compensation of senior management and that of the remaining workforce in relation to the German 
Group companies (vertical appropriateness)."
"For these purposes, the Supervisory Board defines senior 
management as the group of executives of the first two management levels below the Executive Board."
"The 
Supervisory Board looks not only at the current compensation ratio, but also at how it has developed over time."
"If necessary, the Supervisory Board will engage an independent compensation consultant to review vertical 
and horizontal appropriateness; this was last carried out in 2022."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board also 
considers the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code when determining and reviewing the 
remuneration of the Executive Board."
"Any conflict of interest in the establishment, implementation and review of the remuneration policy shall be 
treated by the Supervisory Board in the same way as other conflicts of interest in the person of a Supervisory 
Board member."
"The Supervisory Board member concerned is therefore required to disclose any conflict of 
interest to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and will not participate in the adoption of resolutions or in 
the deliberations concerned."
"Disclosure of any conflicts of interest at an early stage ensures that the decisions 
of the Supervisory Board are not influenced by inappropriate considerations."
"The current Executive Board members’ employment contracts already complied with the new remuneration 
policy in the reporting year, with only a few deviations as explained above."
"As long as such discrepancies 
continue to exist, they will be presented in the company’s Remuneration Report."
"Compliance with the Maximum Remuneration Limits for the Executive Board 
Executive Board remuneration is capped in two respects."
"The maximum 
remuneration covers the maximum possible non-performance-related fixed and performance-related 
variable remuneration components, including employee benefit expense."
"Benefits in kind granted as fringe 
benefits are recognized at their value for income tax purposes."
"Regarding the share-based compensation of 
the Executive Board Chairman, this compensation paid as part of his maximum remuneration is calculated 
based on the pro-rated grant value attributable to one year."
"For this purpose, a separate maximum amount is 
set for each of the variable remuneration components."
"For the 
purposes of calculating maximum remuneration, the Executive Board Chairman’s share-based compensation 
is taken into account at the prorated grant value attributable to one year and thus at an amount fixed from the 
outset (see above)."
"The following table shows the maximum limits for the variable remuneration components and the shares 
granted."
"Compliance with the maximum limits for short-term variable remuneration and for the shares granted 
can be reviewed already for fiscal 2023."
"For multi-year variable remuneration, compliance with the maximum 
limits can only be reviewed retroactively as soon as these are vested or phantom stock units are exercised."

"This D&O insurance policy covers the legal liability arising from Supervisory Board activities and is taken out at 
standard market terms and conditions."
"In line with prevailing market practice at listed companies in Germany, the remuneration of Supervisory Board 
members is strictly fixed compensation along with meeting attendance fees and does not include any 
performance-related components."
"The existing remuneration policy especially takes into account 
Recommendation G.17 and the Suggestion G.18, sentence 1, of the German Corporate Governance Code in 
the current version as amended."

"In addition to 
wages and salaries, average remuneration also includes social security contributions and pension expenses."
"If 
employees simultaneously receive remuneration as members of the Supervisory Board of Sartorius AG, this 
compensation was not considered."
"Remuneration of part-time employees was extrapolated to full-time 
equivalents."
"Requirements pursuant to Section 162, Subsection 1, 
Sentence 2, No."
"6 of the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG) 
The Annual General Meeting approved the Remuneration Report for fiscal 2022 at the Annual General 
Meeting on March 29, 2023 with 99.30% of the votes cast."
"In addition, the legal 
representatives and the Supervisory Board are responsible for such internal control as they consider necessary 
to enable the preparation of a Remuneration Report, including the related disclosures, that is free from 
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error."
"Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Remuneration Report, including the related disclosures, 
based on our audit."
"We conducted our audit in accordance with German Generally Accepted Standards for 
Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in 
Germany] (IDW)."
"Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Remuneration Report, including the related 
disclosures, is free from material misstatements."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
Remuneration Report."
The selection of audit procedures is at the discretion of the auditor.
"This includes 
assessing the risks of material misstatement – whether due to fraud or error – in the Remuneration Report, 
including in relation to the accompanying disclosures."
"When evaluating those risks, the auditor considers the 
internal control system relevant to the preparation of the Remuneration Report, including the related 
disclosures."
"The objective of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate under the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal 
control system."
"Such an audit also includes an assessment of the accounting policies used and whether the 
accounting estimates made by the legal representatives and the Supervisory Board are reasonable, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the Remuneration Report, including the related disclosures."
"In our opinion, we obtained sufficient and appropriate evidence to provide a basis for our audit opinion."
"Prior-year figures were restated 
accordingly."

"General Information 
Sartorius AG is a listed joint stock corporation established in accordance with German law and is the ultimate 
parent company of the Sartorius Group."
"The company is recorded in the German Commercial Register of the 
District Court of Göttingen (HRB 1970) and has its registered office at Otto-Brenner-Str."
"20 in Göttingen, 
Federal Republic of Germany."
The Sartorius Group is a leading international partner of biopharmaceutical research and the industry.
"With 
innovative laboratory instruments and consumables, the Group’s Lab Products & Services Division (LPS) 
concentrates on serving the needs of laboratories performing research and quality control at pharma and 
biopharma companies and those of academic research institutes."
"The Bioprocess Solutions Division (BPS), 
with its broad product portfolio focusing on single-use solutions, helps customers manufacture biotech 
medications and vaccines safely, fast, and efficiently."
"In accordance with Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) in conjunction with Article 4 of 
Regulation (EC) No."
"1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 19, 2002 (OJ L243 p."
"1), 
the consolidated financial statements of Sartorius AG for the year ended December 31, 2023, were prepared 
in accordance with the IFRS and IFRIC Standards and Interpretations of the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) as required to be applied by the European Union."
"These are available on the following 
website: 
https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-
reporting/financial-reporting_en#ifrs-financial-statements 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros."
"Unless otherwise specified, all amounts are 
disclosed in millions of euros (abbreviated as in millions of €)."
"In some cases, the sums of the figures given in 
this report may not precisely equal the stated totals, and percentages may not be exact due to rounding."
"The Executive Board is scheduled to submit the consolidated financial statements to the Supervisory Board 
on February 9, 2024."
"Furthermore, the standard now explicitly defines when information about 
accounting policies is material and provides examples of accounting policies that are generally considered 
material."
"The IFRS Practice Statement 2 was adjusted respectively to provide guidelines for the application of 
the concept of materiality on disclosures of accounting policies."
"This distinction is relevant because changes in accounting 
estimates are required to be recognized prospectively, while those in accounting policies are generally 
required to be recognized retrospectively."
"With the amendment, the scope of this exemption is narrowed so that it does 
not apply to transactions that give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences."
"The 
application of the amendment follows a modified retrospective approach."
"From the perspective of the Group, the amendment especially applies to right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities under IFRS 16 and any resulting temporary differences for which deferred taxes have to be 
recognized mandatorily according to the amendments."
"However, the amendments do not lead to a material 
impact on the consolidated financial statements so that no retrospective adjustment is required, as the Group 
already recognized deferred taxes on differences resulting from leases subsequent to initial recognition of the 
lease."
"▪ Amendments to IAS 12 – International Tax Reform – Pillar Two 
The aim of minimum taxation (so-called Pillar Two) of large Groups is that the companies concerned pay an 
effective corporate tax rate of at least 15 %."
"Because the regulations had not yet entered into force in the 
reporting period, they had no effect on the current tax expense for fiscal 2023."
"Germany adopted a law on 
implementing the minimum taxation in December 2023."
"Therefore, the Group will be subject to minimum 
taxation starting in 2024."
"Based on current knowledge, under considerations of the safe harbor provisions 
which would apply in at least 2024 and the following two years, the new regulation will not have a material 
impact on the Group in the foreseeable future."
"At the moment, the Group's activities in Ireland (nominal tax 
rate: 12.5 %) could potentially have a small impact."
"The amendments to IAS 12 introduced a temporary mandatory exemption from the recognition of deferred 
taxes that would result from the application of the minimum tax provisions."
"In addition, the amendments 
require targeted disclosures for the affected entities."
"The application of the new regulations had no material 
impact on the present consolidated financial statements."
"▪ IFRS 17 and Amendments to IFRS 17 – Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative 
Information 
IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard."
The Group does not plan to apply any standard early.
"To date, the Group does not expect the changes to have a material impact on its consolidated financial 
statements."
"Material General Accounting Policies 
Material accounting policies are described in the notes in which the respective positions of the consolidated 
financial statements are further explained if they relate to specific positions."
"Material general accounting 
policies are described below."
"Foreign Currency Translation 
Subsidiaries’ annual financial statements prepared in foreign currencies have been translated pursuant to 
IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, in accordance with the concept of functional 
currency."
Foreign subsidiaries are regarded as independent subdivisions of the Sartorius Group.
"Items in the 
statement of financial position are generally translated at the exchange rates on the reporting date."
"An 
exception to this is the equity of consolidated subsidiaries, which is translated at historical cost."
"Income and 
expense items are converted at average rates."
"Any translation differences resulting from the use of different 
exchange rates for items in the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss are 
recognized in the other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity."
"In the individual financial statements of the consolidated companies, transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency of the company at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction."
"Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the closing rate on the 
reporting date."
"Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are generally recognized in other operating 
income or expenses."
"By contrast, currency gains and losses in connection with financing activities, such as 
loans in a foreign currency, are recognized in the financial result."
"For the accounting for the high inflation in Argentina and Türkiye in accordance with IAS 29, Financial 
Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, see Note 12."
"Critical Accounting Judgment and Accounting Estimates 
During the preparation of consolidated financial statements, management uses estimates and assumptions 
based on their best knowledge of the current situation, including expectations of future developments."
"However, actual results may differ from these estimates."
"Therefore, these estimates and assumptions are 
revised on a regular basis, and the impact of all changes is immediately recognized in the statement of profit 
or loss for the period."
"Even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, the general uncertainty inherent in accounting estimates and 
assumptions remains on a higher level than usual, also as a result of uncertainties related to changes in the 
geopolitical situation."
"This includes possible decoupling trends of various nations, Russia's ongoing attack on 
Ukraine, and the developments in the Middle East."
"Following the exceptionally high growth rates in the recent 
past resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group is currently in a normalization phase."
"In fiscal 2023, 
this led to a reduction in sales revenues and net result in comparison with the prior year."
"In the Bioprocess 
Solutions Division (BPS), especially the almost complete decrease of the demand in connection with the 
COVID-19 pandemic as well as the reduction in inventories among biopharma customers affected sales 
revenue negatively in the reporting period."
"The Lab Products & Services Division (LPS) also recognized a 
decline in sales revenue, mainly due to an increased reluctance to buy by customers from China and the USA."
"The Group views the current demand situation after the pandemic as a phase that only temporarily 
overshadows the fundamental growth drivers of the life science and biopharma markets."
"Accordingly, robust 
profitable growth is expected in the years to come."
"In light of the developments in fiscal 2023, the Group 
withdrew its expectations for 2025 that were raised twice in former years and set updated mid-term targets 
for 2028 at the beginning of 2024."
"In addition, Group management exercises its judgment in defining the accounting treatment of specific 
transactions when the existing standards and interpretations do not explicitly treat the accounting problems 
concerned."
"Significant judgments and estimates are especially relevant to the business combinations described in Note 8 
and the contingent consideration liabilities recognized in connection with prior acquisitions; the values may 
vary due to their complex subsequent accounting at fair value (see Note 35)."
"Other significant judgments and estimates are described in the Notes, which provide explanations for the 
positions of the consolidated financial statements if they relate to specific positions."
"This has been done under consideration of the sanctions in force and in line 
with the practice of other companies in the pharmaceutical and health sector."
"The sales revenues in Russia 
were significantly lower than in the prior year, while the Group’s business in Russia was already not of a critical 
size in relation to the Group before the beginning of the conflict."
"The Group is primarily affected by the indirect 
consequences of the conflict, for example, increasing energy prices and the impact on the worldwide 
transportation and logistics sector."
"The Group is monitoring these indirect consequences and currently 
assumes that it will be able to maintain its profitability on the current level through appropriate 
countermeasures, such as price increases."
"The Group does not own material non-current assets in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine."
"The default risks in 
relation to trade receivables in Russia are limited due to the immaterial volume of trade receivables on the 
reporting date."
"Cash held in Russia of a high single-digit to a low double-digit million euro value remains 
subject to restrictions regarding its use outside Russia."
"In particular, material distributions of cash are currently 
impossible."
"Impact of the Middle East Conflict 
On October 7, 2023, Israel was attacked by the Hamas terrorist group."
"Since then, battles have continued 
between the Israeli army and Hamas."
"The Group's Israeli site for the production of cell culture media products 
is located in Beit Haemek in the north of the country."
"Most of the dispute has been in the areas of the Gaza 
Strip, the southern region and the Tel Aviv area."
"Nevertheless, the situation was and is still tense in the north of 
the country."
On-site production as well as transport and logistics had previously been maintained.
"To date, 
there is no material impact on the consolidated financial statements."
"Impairment of Assets 
The carrying amounts of property, plant, and equipment (see Notes 16 and 17) and intangible assets including 
goodwill (Note 15) are examined to determine whether there is any indication that an asset might be impaired, 
pursuant to IAS 36, Impairment of Assets."
"If there is any indication that an asset is impaired, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated."
"The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of 
its fair value – less costs of disposal – and its value in use."
"If the individual asset’s recoverable amount cannot 
be estimated, the recoverable amount of the asset’s cash-generating unit (CGU) is estimated."
"The calculation of the value in use is generally based on discounted cash flow methods, which use cash flow 
projections of up to five years."
"These projections take into account past experience and represent 
management's best estimate about future sales revenue and cost developments."
"Cash flows after the 
planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates."
"Key assumptions on which management has 
based its determination of the value in use include estimated growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, 
and tax rates."
"These estimates can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately on the 
amount of any impairment."
"Fair Value Measurement 
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both 
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, including Level 3 fair values."
"When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as 
possible."
"Fair value measurement is especially relevant to business combinations (Note 8), financial instruments 
(Note 35), and share-based payments (Note 42)."
"Climate-Related Matters 
Sustainability is one of the core values of the Group."
"Accordingly, the Group has publicly committed itself to a 
long-term oriented reduction of the CO2 emission intensity (see the Non-Financial Group Statement)."
"The 
goal is predominantly to reduce actual emissions in relation to the Group’s sales revenues."
"No compensation 
payments are planned to date, but may be decided on at a later date."
"The future costs for the reduction 
measures are considered in the financial forecasts of management and are therefore also considered in 
valuations made for financial reporting purposes."
The Group set a further long-term sustainability goal in fiscal 2023 and wants to be climate-neutral by 2045.
"In this context, the Group works toward decarbonization in cooperation with suppliers and customers."
"For 
example, electricity requirements are planned to be met by 2030 using energy from renewable sources."
"To date, no impact on the assets and liabilities of the Group is observed."
"Operating Segments 
According to IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the identification of reportable operating segments is based on the 
“management approach;” i.e., the segments are defined in accordance with the internal control and reporting 
structure of an entity."
"Consequently, the divisions Bioprocess Solutions (BPS) and Lab Products & Services (LPS) are considered 
operating segments."
Essential criteria for their definition are the products sold in the divisions.
"“Underlying EBITDA” is the key performance indicator of the operating segments of the Group, as 
management uses this performance measure to control the Group and segments."
"EBITDA corresponds to 
earnings before interest (financial result), taxes, depreciation, and amortization."
"“Underlying EBITDA” is an 
operating result adjusted for extraordinary items."
“Underlying EBITDA” is not a defined performance measure in IFRSs.
"The Group’s definition of underlying 
EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled performance measures and disclosures by other entities."
"Apart from that, the recognition and measurement methods for the reportable segments conform to the 
general Group accounting principles."
"For intersegment transactions, internal transfer prices are set at prices corresponding to those that would have 
been agreed between external third parties in the particular situation and under the given framework 
conditions."
"Essentially, these prices are calculated by applying the cost-plus method and the resale price 
method or a combination of the two methods."
"The methods for determining the internal transfer prices are 
Sartorius 
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes    Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
190 
 
 
Start 
 
documented promptly and updated continuously."
"The volume of such intersegment transactions is 
immaterial."
"Segment assets and segment liabilities are not reported to the Executive Board as chief operating decision 
maker on a regular basis and are therefore not part of the segment report."
"The non-current assets correspond to property, plant, and 
equipment as well as to intangible assets (including goodwill)."
"In fiscal 2023 and the prior year, none of our customers accounted for more than 5 % of sales revenue."
"Statement of Cash Flows 
The statement of cash flows shows the impact of cash inflows and outflows on the cash and cash equivalents 
of the Group."
"The cash flows are classified by operating, investing, and financing activities according to IAS 7, 
Statement of Cash Flows."
"In this context, cash and cash equivalents are assets that can be converted into cash in the short term 
(generally within three months)."
"The amount disclosed in the statement of cash flows primarily includes cash 
on hand, bank balances, and similar items; it equals the amount presented in the statement of financial 
position."
"The following non-cash transactions were concluded that are not presented in the statement of cash flows: 
▪ Additions to non-current assets related to leases according to IFRS 16 are presented in Note 17."
"▪ The expenses incurred by granting shares to the CEO and two further members of the Executive 
Board totaled €0.6 million in 2023 and €1.3 million in 2022."

Scope of Consolidated Financial Statements 
The consolidated financial statements of Sartorius AG include the annual financial statements of all major 
companies controlled directly or indirectly via its subsidiaries by Sartorius AG."
"Such investees are included in the consolidated financial statements from the time when Sartorius AG or its 
subsidiaries acquire such control."
"They are no longer included as of the time control is lost, e.g., due to a sale 
to an entity outside the Group."
"Subsidiaries are included on the basis of their annual financial statements for the same reporting period as the 
parent company, using uniform Group-wide accounting policies."
"All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses, and cash flows relating to transactions between 
members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation."

"Following the acquisition, PolygenX C S.A.S."
"was merged into PolygenX B S.A.S., which in turn

"For information on the acquisitions, see Note 8."
"In fiscal 2023, the Group acquired an additional 10 % of the share capital in Sartorius Korea Biotech LLC, Seoul,

"Business Combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method."
"The identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed by the Group, as well as the consideration transferred, are recognized at fair value at the 
acquisition date."
Expenses directly related to business combinations are reported in profit or loss of the period.
"Their measurement is largely based 
on projected cash flows and on risk equivalent cost of capital for their discounting."
"Differences between the 
expected and actual cash flows may have a material impact on future Group results."
"For material acquisitions, purchase price allocation is generally carried out with the assistance of independent 
third-party valuation specialists."
The valuations are based on the information available at the acquisition date.
"In case material risks and rewards remain with the non-controlling shareholders, 
the Group decided to continue to present the non-controlling interest in the acquiree."
"The liability that needs 
to be recognized for such obligations is recognized against retained earnings at the acquisition date."
"The 
Group decided to recognize any changes in connection with the subsequent accounting directly in equity."

France."
"The company imports and distributes the products of the Sartorius Group in Türkiye and employed

"Expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of €0.2 million were 
recognized in other expenses."
"Goodwill is allocated to the segment Bioprocess Solutions (BPS) and reflects, 
among other things, securing the market presence and business opportunities in the region, the workforce 
acquired, and other intangible assets not separable."
Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
"Headquartered in 
Strasbourg, France, Polyplus was founded in 2001 and has locations in France, Belgium, the U.S., and China."
"With around 270 employees, Polyplus develops and produces transfection as well as other DNA/RNA delivery 
reagents and plasmid DNA in high, GMP-grade quality."
"These are key components in the production of viral 
vectors used in cell and gene therapies and other advanced medicinal therapeutic products."
"The directly attributable acquisition-related costs totaled €11.8 million and were recognized in 
other expenses."
"The intangible assets recognized separately on a preliminary basis are related to technologies 
(approx."
"€790 million) with useful lives of up to 18 years as well as customer relationships (€48 million) and 
brands (€36 million) with limited useful lives."
"Goodwill is expected to reflect the expansion of the product 
offering of the Bioprocess Solutions Division (BPS) and synergies, especially from the combination of the 
acquired business with the existing product portfolio with a focus on cell and gene therapies."
"In particular, the 
products of Polyplus are key components in the manufacture of cell and gene therapies and provide access 
to a significant share in this growing, early-stage market."
"In addition, goodwill is expected to reflect other non-
separable intangible assets, such as the know-how of the acquired workforce."
"Goodwill is not deductible for 
tax purposes."
"Effects of the Acquisitions on the Group’s Sales Revenue and Net Result in 2023 
Since their first-time consolidation, the companies acquired in the course of the acquisition of the Polyplus 
Group contributed sales revenue of approximately €38.6 million to the sales of the Group."
"Excluding items 
from the preliminary purchase price allocation and financing expenses for this acquisition, Polyplus 
contributed an amount of approximately €13.6 million to the Group’s net result since the acquisition date."
"Since the entity is acting as a distributor, there would be no material effect on the Group sales revenues and 
net result if the acquisition of Sartonet had been completed as of January 1, 2023."

"Sales Revenue 
Revenue is recognized according to IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers."
"Revenue is 
disaggregated into the categories of “nature of products” and “geographical regions” as well as according to 
“type of revenue” (recurring/non-recurring) as shown in the following table."
"The categorization by “nature of 
products” corresponds to the reportable segments, as the identification of the reportable segments is based 
in particular on the different products sold."
"Regional disaggregation of revenue is based on the customers’ 
location."
"The Group defines recurring revenue as revenue from consumables and services, while non-
recurring revenue is primarily defined as instrument revenue."
"The Group satisfies its performance obligations depending on the goods to be transferred and 
the services promised."
"Most of the revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point in time 
where the customer obtains control over the goods."
"Typically, this is when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods are transferred to the customer."
"Therefore, the point in time may vary depending on 
the agreement with the individual customer."
"For complex products that require installation at the customer’s site, revenue is recognized upon formal 
customer acceptance."
"To a low extent, revenue is recognized over time in the customer-specific project 
business."
"In these cases, revenue is recognized according to project progress, which is measured based on the 
percentage of costs to date compared to total estimated contract costs."
"The amount of actual costs incurred 
to date appropriately reflects the progress and the transfer of control to the customer, as the Group has a right 
to reimbursement of costs to date plus an appropriate margin if the project is canceled by the customer 
without cause."
"Revenue from services is generally recognized when the services are performed or have been 
performed."
"If the services are performed continuously over a period of time, the Group recognizes the related 
revenue over time."
"In this case, revenue is generally recognized pro rata in relation to the total contract period."
Product sales are typically accompanied by the legally required warranty.
"Any material extended warranties 
are accounted for as separate performance obligations."
"Sartorius

According to the general payment terms, customer payments are due in the short term, typically within 30 to 
60 days."
"To some extent, the Group obtains advance payments, e.g., to avoid credit risks."
"Therefore, the Group 
regularly has contract liabilities (payments received on account of orders)."
"In addition, the Group recognizes 
contract liabilities in connection with service contracts (deferred revenues) when customers pay in advance."
The contracts typically do not contain significant financing components.
"The Group uses the practical 
expedient provided by IFRS 15 regarding the existence of a significant financing component."
"This means that 
a financing component is only taken into consideration when the length of time between the transfer of goods 
or services and the receipt of consideration is expected to exceed one year and the effect is material."
"The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied 
(or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period amounted to €1,609.7 million (2022: 
€1,998.3 million)."
"The Group expects that these unsatisfied performance obligations will, for the most part, be 
satisfied in 2024."
"There were no extraordinary changes in the carrying amounts of the contract liabilities and contract assets in 
the reporting period."
"Revenue in the amount of €235.2 million was recognized in the reporting period that was 
included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the reporting period (2022: €249.1 million)."
The balances of trade receivables and contract assets are presented in Note 29.

losses on trade receivables and contract assets recognized in the reporting period, see Note 40."

"Expenses relating to cross-functional initiatives or projects are assigned to the respective functional costs 
based on an appropriate allocation principle."
The “Cost of sales” item includes the cost of products sold and the cost of merchandise sold.
"In addition to 
directly attributable expenses, such as raw materials and supplies, employee benefits expenses, and energy 
expenses, cost of sales also includes overheads that can be attributed to the manufacturing area, and the 
corresponding depreciation and amortization."
"The selling and distribution expenses relate in particular to the costs of the sales organization, distribution, and 
marketing."
"Research and development expenses comprise the cost of research and product and process development, 
provided they are not capitalized."

"These essentially include effects from currency translation, allowances 
on trade receivables, and extraordinary income and expenses."
"Since fiscal 2023, extraordinary income and expenses are generally allocated to the respective functions."

"The prior year’s figures have been adjusted 
accordingly (see Note 10)."
"For details about the types of extraordinary income and expenses, see Note 5."
"In 2023, currency translation gains include €0.6 million (2022: €50.3 million) from the reclassification of 
amounts in relation to hedging relationships that had previously been recognized in equity (see Note 37)."
"The income from the valuation of contingent

In fiscal 2023, the Group acquired a subsidiary based in Türkiye (see Note 8)."
"Türkiye was assessed as a 
hyperinflationary economy in the reporting period 2023 and, therefore, IAS 29, Financial Reporting in 
Hyperinflationary Economies, was applied."
"The net gains or losses from the inflation of material non-monetary 
assets and liabilities, as well as equity and all items in the income statement, were recognized in the financial 
result."
"The general consumer price index of the Turkish Statistical Institute was applied (index as of May 2023: 
1,300.6 and as of end of 2023: 1,859.4)."
"An inflation adjustment was also made for the sales entity in Argentina 
in the period 2023."
"The general consumer price index of the “indec” was used (Instituto Nacional de Estadística 
y Censos; index as of end of 2022: 1,134.6 and as of end of 2023: 2,816.1)."
"The effect in the prior year was not 
material."
"In addition, current taxes may contain adjusted amounts to cover any tax 
payments or refunds for years not yet assessed."
"The following table explains the differences between the tax expense expected and the income tax expenses 
reported for the particular fiscal year."
"The expected tax rate is determined based on a weighted average tax 
rate applied to the pre-tax income of the Group."
"The corresponding income is not taxable and, therefore, results in a decrease in the tax rate 
in relation to the profit before tax reported in these consolidated financial statements."
"In 2023, this effect is 
overcompensated by opposing items, such as non-tax-deductible expenses in connection with subsidiaries 
and associated companies."
"Earnings per Share 
IAS 33, Earnings per Share, requires earnings per share to be calculated separately for each class of share."
"The 
undiluted earnings per share (basic EPS) are calculated based on the number of shares outstanding during 
the period."
Treasury shares are not included in the calculation of the average number of shares outstanding.

increases in the EBITDA margin."
"For the Bioprocess Solutions Division, calculations were based on an average 
terminal growth rate of 2.5 % for the fiscal years after 2027."
"This terminal growth rate is derived from long-term 
inflation and market expectations, which forecast medium-term growth rates in the high upper single-digit to 
double-digit range for the biopharmaceutical market targeted by the division."
"The major growth drivers will 
include the aging population, the increase in population, and improved access to pharmaceuticals in 
emerging-market countries, as well as the ongoing paradigm shift toward the utilization of single-use products 
in the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals."
"The increasing relevance of new modalities, such as in the area of

division."
"For the Lab Products & Services Division, a terminal growth rate of 1.5 % was used for fiscal years after

Intangible assets acquired are reported at cost less accumulated, regular amortization calculated according 
to the straight-line method."
"The useful life of an intangible asset is the period over which this asset is expected 
to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the entity."
"Costs incurred within the scope of the development of new products and methods are capitalized as internally 
generated intangible assets only if the criteria according to IAS 38.57 are met."
"The capitalization of internally-
generated intangible assets includes a certain level of estimates and assumptions, e.g., the assessment of the 
technical feasibility of a development project, its expected market prospects, and the determination of useful 
lives."
"The capitalized development costs essentially cover the costs attributable to the staff involved in R&D, raw 
materials and supplies, external services, and directly attributable overheads."
"Internally-generated intangible 
assets are amortized over their useful lives on a straight-line basis."
"If an internally-generated intangible asset cannot be capitalized, the development costs are recognized as 
expenses in the period in which they are incurred."
"Costs for research activities are reported as expenses in the 
period in which they are incurred."
"However, because of the integration of the “Stedim” brand into the name of the 
“Sartorius Stedim Biotech” sub-group and the name of that sub-group’s parent entity, the relevant cash flows 
cannot be measured separately."
"The recoverability of the brand name was considered at the next higher level 
of the cash-generating unit (CGU), i.e., the Bioprocess Solutions Division."
"The useful lives of the remaining brand names acquired through business combinations are estimated at up 
to 20 years."
Amortization of intangible assets is allocated to the corresponding functions in the statement of profit or loss.

The item “Property, plant and equipment” is reported at cost and, if subject to depreciation, reduced by regular 
depreciation."
Impairment tests are conducted when impairment indicators are identified.
"The straight-line 
method is applied to depreciation reported in the consolidated financial statements."
"Depreciation of property, plant, and equipment is based on the economic useful life."
"Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, 
or production of a qualifying asset and are therefore part of the cost of that asset."
Grants related to assets are generally deducted from the cost of assets.
"Leases 
Lease accounting follows IFRS 16, Leases."
"For the financing structure of the Sartorius Group, leases are not of 
high relevance."
"In fiscal 2023 and in the past, the Group invested heavily in its sites."
"The main considerations 
for leases are therefore generally of a practical nature, for example, with regard to the company’s management 
of IT hardware or fleet management."
"Accordingly, leases of IT hardware and cars represent the major number 
Sartorius 
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes    Notes to the Statement of Financial Position 
 
211 
 
 
Start 
 
of the Group’s lease contracts."
"The lease term of such leases is generally fixed, typically extending to between 
three and five years."
"Furthermore, at some sites, the Group has leases of buildings, which are negotiated and managed locally."
"These contracts may contain extension options, which are included in the lease term according to IFRS 16 
when the Group is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised."
"The Group does not act as a lessor to a 
material extent."
"According to IFRS 16, a lessee generally recognizes a right-of-use asset as well as a lease liability, which 
represents its obligation to make lease payments."
"The Group makes use of the exemptions for short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets and recognizes the corresponding lease payments as an expense 
generally on a straight-line basis over the particular lease term."
"Accordingly, no right-of-use assets and no 
lease liabilities are recognized for these leases."
"Furthermore, taking IFRS 16 under consideration, no right-of-
use assets and no liabilities are recognized for leases between Group entities."
"The Group does not apply this 
Standard to leases of intangible assets."
"In the statement of financial position, the Group presents right-of-use assets according to the nature of the 
underlying lease assets under “Property, plant and equipment.” Right-of-use assets are recognized at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses."
"The cost of the right-of-use assets comprises the 
present value of the future lease payments, any payments paid upon or before commencement of the lease, 
any initial direct costs, and costs for dismantling or removing the lease asset."
"The right-of-use assets are 
typically depreciated over the lease term."
"If the transfer of legal ownership of a lease asset is planned at the 
end of the lease term, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the economic useful life of the lease asset."
"In 
the statement of profit or loss, depreciation is recognized within functional costs."
The lease liabilities are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial position.
"Lease liabilities 
are initially recognized at an amount equal to the present value of the future lease payments."
"The lease 
payments generally do not include any payments in relation to non-lease components."
"In general, the specific 
applicable incremental borrowing rate of the Group is used for discounting."
"Subsequently, the carrying 
amount of the lease liabilities is increased by interest expenses and reduced by lease payments."
"Interest 
expenses are reported in the financial result and, to the extent they are paid, in the financing section of the 
cash flow statement together with “Interest paid.” 
As of December 31, 2023, lease liabilities stood at €147 million (2022: €144 million)."
"The maturities of the future 
lease payments are presented in Note 39."
"The undiscounted cash outflows for leases to which the Group is 
committed but that have not yet commenced as of the reporting date amount to €30.0 million (prior year: 
immaterial)."
"The composition of the right-of-use assets included in “Property, plant and equipment” as of 
December 31, 2023, as well as of the preceding reporting date and the main changes, are presented in the

"In addition, loss 
and interest carry-forwards and tax credits are considered."
"Measurement is based on the tax rates expected 
to be effective in the period in which the asset is realized, the liability is settled, or the loss or interest carry-
forwards are used."
"Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in income taxes in the statement 
of profit or loss."
"The exceptions are changes that are to be recognized in other comprehensive income directly 
in equity, as well as effects from acquisitions."
"In principle, tax rates and tax rules are used that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date."
"Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit at the level of the 
relevant tax authority will be available for the utilization of the deductible temporary differences or losses 
carried forward."
"The amount of uncertain tax positions is determined on the basis of the 
best estimate of expected tax payments."
"In 2021, more than 130 countries agreed on the introduction of a minimum taxation (so-called Pillar Two) for 
multinational groups with global sales revenues exceeding €750 million."
"See Note 2 for the impact on the 
Group."
"Deferred tax assets have to be recognized for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and unused tax losses can be utilized."
"As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond 
management’s control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in 
which deferred tax assets will be recovered."
Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.
"If 
management considers it probable that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset cannot be realized, a 
corresponding valuation allowance is taken into account."
"Deferred Tax Assets 
For losses of €146 million to be carried forward (prior year: €141 million), no deferred tax amounts were 
recognized because of the lack of foreseeability of future taxable profits."
"Of these unused tax losses, 
€3.5 million can still be carried forward for a limited time (prior year: €6.0 million), of which €3.0 million will 
expire in the next five years (prior year: €4.1 million)."
"In addition, the Group had unused interest carry-forwards 
in the amount of €11.9 million (prior year: €3.0 million) for which deferred tax assets amounting to €2.8 million 
were recognized (prior year: €0.0 million)."
"Furthermore, no deferred tax assets were recognized for deductible 
temporary differences amounting to €11 million (prior year: €20 million)."
"Deferred tax assets of about €5 million (prior year: about €3 million) relate to companies that reported losses 
in the year under review or in the prior reporting period."
"These losses carried forward were reported as assets 
to the extent that it is assumed that taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the unused tax 
losses and the deductible temporary differences can be offset."
"This is assumed especially in cases where the 
losses resulted from one-time or special items."
"Deferred Tax Liabilities 
The deferred tax liabilities in connection with intangible assets essentially relate to assets acquired in business 
combinations and, consequently, are mainly linked to customer relationships and technologies."

Raw materials and supplies, including merchandise, are reported under “Inventories” at average cost."
"In 
principle, finished goods and work in progress are reported at cost of conversion."
"This cost includes direct 
costs attributable to these materials and the appropriate portion of production and material handling 
overheads, general administrative expenses, and depreciation and/or amortization of non-current assets, 
provided that these expenses are caused by production."
Inventories must be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
"The net realizable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary for marketing, sales, and distribution."
"Where inventory risks exist, such as the risk of 
reduced shelf life as a result of storage periods or limited usability, inventories are marked down accordingly."
"Issued Capital 
The issued capital of Sartorius AG is divided into 37,440,000 bearer ordinary shares and 37,440,000 non-
voting preference shares, each with a calculated par value of €1.00."
"Preference share owners receive an 
increased dividend (surplus dividend) of €0.01 per preference share from the distributable profit; however, the 
dividend must amount to at least €0.02 per preference share."
All shares are fully paid up.
"Sartorius AG exercised the authority granted at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on June 21, 2000, to 
repurchase treasury shares in the amount of €16,082 K pursuant to Section 71 (1), no."
"8 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG)."
"As required by IAS 32, treasury shares were deducted from equity and capital 
reserves."
These shares are held in particular as currency for future acquisitions of companies.
"From October 27, 
2000, to the reporting date, a total of 831,944 ordinary shares were repurchased at an average price of €11.27 
and a total of 840,983 preference shares at an average price of €7.98."
"Following the stock split carried out in 
2016, 3,213,991 ordinary shares and 3,250,147 preference shares remain as treasury stock, representing a 
proportion of €6,464 K (8.6 %) of the share capital."
"As in the prior year, no treasury shares were purchased in 
fiscal 2023."
"In December 2015, 25,000 ordinary shares and 25,000 preference shares were issued to the CEO and 
Executive Board Charmain Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg in accordance with his 2014 remuneration agreement."
"In 
November 2020, 13,785 ordinary shares and 13,785 preference shares were issued to the CEO and Executive 
Board Chairman Dr. Joachim Kreuzburg in accordance with his 2019 remuneration agreement."
"In December 
2023, Dr. Alexandra Gatzemeyer and Dr. René Fáber were granted additional remuneration in shares that were 
transferred on January 1, 2024."
"Dr. Gatzemeyer was granted 1,496 ordinary shares and 1,186 preference shares."
"Dr. Fáber was granted 1,923 ordinary shares and 1,525 preference shares."
"Reserves 
Capital Reserves 
Capital reserves include the amounts generated above the nominal amount in previous years, when 
Sartorius AG issued shares."
"As part of the stock split, an amount of €51.3 million was reclassified from capital 
reserves to issued capital."
"Cash Flow Hedging Reserves 
Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income as part of an effective hedging relationship are 
transferred to the cash flow hedging reserves."
"In particular, these are fluctuations in the fair value of currency 
and interest hedges as well as their respective tax effects."
"The cumulative amount transferred to other 
comprehensive income as of the reporting date stands at €– 3.2 million (prior year: €– 15.2 million)."
"Pension Reserves 
Actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit plan commitments, including their respective tax effects, are 
included in pension reserves."
"For further details, see Note 23."
"Non-Controlling Interest 
The Sartorius Stedim Biotech sub-group headquartered in Aubagne, France, accounts for the majority of non-
controlling interest in the Sartorius Group."
"The latter holds approximately 74 % of the capital and 85 % of the 
voting rights in this sub-group."
"The following subsidiaries account for further non-controlling interest 
amounts: 
▪ ALS Automated Lab Solutions GmbH, Jena, Germany (share capital of the Group: 62.5 %) 
▪ Sartorius CellGenix GmbH, Freiburg i."
"B., Germany (76 %) 
▪ Sartorius Korea Biotech, Seoul, South Korea (79 %) 
▪ Sartorius Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand (33 %) 
In 2023, the Group purchased 25 % of the shares in the entity Sartorius CellGenix GmbH for a purchase price 
of approximately €66.7 million in cash."
"The corresponding cash flow is presented within cash flow from 
financing activities."
"The financial liability that had been recognized for the corresponding put option of the 
non-controlling interest amounting to €66.1 million (as of December 31, 2022) was reclassified to retained 
earnings."
"The impact on the non-controlling interest and the equity attributable to the owners of the parent 
company is presented in the statement of changes in equity."
"In fiscal 2023, the Group also acquired an additional 10 % of the share capital in Sartorius Korea Biotech LLC 
for a purchase price of approximately €20.8 million."
"The cash flow is presented within cash flow from financing 
activities."
The Group now owns 79 % of the share capital and voting rights of the entity.
"Sartorius Thailand is consolidated due to contractual arrangements over the exercise of voting rights that 
ensure control."

"Pension and Employee Benefits Provisions 
Defined Contribution Plans 
Most companies in the Group have defined contribution plans, frequently in the form of government-backed 
retirement insurances."
"In fiscal 2023, an amount of €64.5 million was recognized for defined contribution plans 
(prior year: €60.6 million)."
"Defined Benefit Plans 
Pension provisions and similar obligations are recognized in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, 
applying the projected unit credit method."
"Under this method, obligations for pensions and other post-
employment benefits are determined in accordance with actuarial valuations."
"In addition to known pensions 
and entitlements, these valuations rely on certain assumptions including discount rates, future salary and 
pension increases, and mortality rates."
"The assumed discount factors reflect the returns provided by prime corporate (industrial) bonds with fixed 
coupons, matching maturities, and denominated in the relevant currencies on the reporting date."
"If such 
corporate bonds are not available with matching long-term maturities or are insufficiently available, their 
matching interest rates are determined by extrapolation."
"All resulting differences are shown directly in other comprehensive income of the respective 
period according to IAS 19 and do therefore not affect profit or loss."
"The actuarial losses, which were 
transferred to the pension reserves, essentially resulted from a change in the discount rate and totaled  
€– 21.0 million (prior year: €– 21.2 million)."
"An amount of €43.5 million (prior year: €44.1 million) relates in particular to the net amount of pension 
provisions for retirement pension plans in Germany."
"These provisions are based on direct commitments to 
employees under defined benefit pension plans."
"Under these commitments, the employees earn benefits for 
each year of service rendered to the company."
The pension benefits are generally not funded by assets.
"A 
substantial portion of these provisions relates to Sartorius AG."
"In this case, the obligations measured pertain, 
firstly, to the General Pension Plan (“Allgemeine Versorgungsordnung”) for employees whose employment 
commenced prior to January 1, 1983."
"Secondly, individual commitments have been made to current and 
former Executive Board members and executives."

Composition of Plan Assets 
Plan assets essentially consist of insurance contracts with insurance companies in Germany and Switzerland."
"An amount of €7.6 million (prior year: €6.3 million) is held by local banks as securities for subsidiaries in South 
Korea."
The defined benefit plans do not entail any significant entity-specific or plan-specific risks.
"Due to the rather 
low coverage of the defined benefit obligation by plan assets, liquidity risks arise in principle, which are 
immaterial for the Group due to their low monetary amount."
"Furthermore, the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation was calculated using the same method that was applied in calculating the 
defined benefit obligation liability recognized in the statement of financial position (projected unit credit 
method)."

"For fiscal 2024, payments of €6.3 million for defined benefit plan commitments are expected (prior year: 
€6.2 million)."
These cover contributions to plan assets and payment of retirement benefits.
"Other Provisions 
Provisions are recognized if a legal or constructive obligation or liability to third parties exists and if an outflow 
of resources is probable and the expected obligation can be reliably estimated."
"The amount recognized for a 
provision represents the best estimate of the obligation at the reporting date."
"To determine the amount of the obligations, certain estimates and assumptions need to be applied, including 
an evaluation of the probability that such an obligation could occur, and the amount of costs incurred."
"Typically, significant uncertainties are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts, 
warranty costs, closure of business locations, asset retirement obligations, and legal proceedings."

"The early retirement plans are partial retirement plans that permit employees to work part-time for 3 to 5 years 
directly before they are due to retire at the legal retirement age and that are financially supported by the 
company."
"According to IAS 19, the expenses related to severance payments to be earned in future periods

"Actuarial gains and losses, 
as well as past service costs, are to be recognized in profit or loss."
"Bonuses for service anniversaries are generally granted to employees who have completed 20, 25, 30, and 40

Such financial instruments are recognized on the trade date.
"The following 
sections provide a comprehensive overview of the relevance of financial instruments to Sartorius and 
additional information on the items of the statement of financial position that include financial instruments."
"Financial assets are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, as well as derivatives 
with a positive fair value."
"Financial liabilities of the Group mainly comprise bonds and loans from banks, trade payables, lease liabilities, 
and derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value."
"Furthermore, financial liabilities result from 
contingent consideration according to IFRS 3 and from written put options over non-controlling interests."
"Except for derivative financial instruments and contingent consideration, financial liabilities are measured at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method."
"Financial Instruments: Material Accounting Policies 
Financial instruments are accounted for according to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments."
"There were no reclassifications 
of financial instruments during the reporting period."
"With regard to the impairment of financial assets, IFRS 9 sets out an expected-loss model."
"Financial assets are 
generally regarded as credit-impaired when there are objective indications that cast doubt on the probability 
of fully collecting the cash flows of the respective financial assets."
"At Sartorius Group, the simplified approach 
applied to trade receivables is of particular importance."
"No impairment is recognized for 
these financial assets due to materiality considerations."
"As on the last reporting date, for the remaining 
financial assets that are measured at amortized cost, no impairment is recognized as of December 31, 2023, for 
the 12 -month expected credit losses, given the Group’s immaterial historical losses."
Derivatives such as forward contracts on foreign currencies are measured at fair value.
"In this context, the 
derivatives are recognized at fair value calculated applying recognized mathematical methods."
"The fair values 
are based on the market data available at the time the value of these derivatives is calculated."
"Instruments that 
are not designated as hedging instruments and to which no hedge accounting is applied are classified as held 
for trading."
"Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in profit or loss 
or, in the case of hedging relationships, in other comprehensive income."
The Group applies the hedge accounting rules of IFRS 9.
"The Group uses forward transactions to hedge cash 
flow risks that result from changes in foreign exchange rates in relation to sales of products and the production 
activities, and designates only the spot element of the hedging instrument."
"Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Group considers all highly liquid investments with up to three months‘ maturity from the date of 
acquisition to be cash or cash equivalents."
These mainly comprise deposits in banks.
"Cash and cash 
equivalents are measured at cost."
"As of the reporting date on December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents 
stood at around €379.2 million (prior year: €165.9 million)."
"Current Trade and Other Receivables

"Contract assets result from customer-specific construction contracts that meet the criteria for recognition of

"The amount of trade receivables presented as of 
December 31, 2023, is reduced by €224.5 million as a result of factoring because substantially all risks and 
rewards in relation to the financial assets sold were transferred to the buyer (prior year: €240.0 million)."
"In 
particular, credit risk and any foreign exchange rate risks were transferred completely."
Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are recognized using separate allowance accounts.
"For 
information on how these allowances were determined, see Note 40."

"In particular, the funds were used for 
the refinancing of the bridge financing taken out for the Polyplus acquisition and beyond for general corporate 
financing purposes."
"The interest rate level was partially hedged in advance, see Note 38."
"An additional major pillar of financing for the Sartorius Group is the syndicated credit line of €800 million 
concluded in May 2022 with a maturity until 2028, which can be extended in spring 2024 for one year upon 
unanimous agreement of the parties."
"On the reporting date, this credit line is not utilized (prior year:

"Further elements of the company’s financing are various note loans (“Schuldscheindarlehen”) 
placed in 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2022, respectively, with a total volume on the reporting date of approximately 
€1,505 million and original maturities of up to 13 years."

"The fair values of the financial instruments were determined on the basis of the market information available 
on the reporting date, and are to be allocated to one of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance 
with IFRS 13."
"Level 1 financial instruments are measured on the basis of prices quoted on active markets for identical assets 
and liabilities."
"Level 3 financial 
instruments are measured on the basis of input factors that cannot be derived from observable market data."
"The financial instruments recognized at fair value as at December 31, 2023, relate, among other things, to the 
contingent considerations in connection with the acquisitions of BIA Separations and Xell."
"Since the valuations 
depend, among other factors, on the predicted sales performance of the acquired businesses, the valuations 
are regarded as Level 3 inputs."
"The valuations are performed using updated valuation parameters on the 
reporting date."
"In connection with the acquisition of BIA Separations, the parties agreed on three tranches of earn-out 
payments based on the sales performance of the acquired entity over the five fiscal years subsequent to the 
acquisition."
"Depending on this sales performance, the sellers are entitled to receive additional shares in 
Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"Besides the expected future sales performance and therefore the assumed 
number of shares to be transferred, the valuation of this contingent consideration considers also the expected 
future share price of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"As of the reporting date on December 31, 2023, the fair 
value of the remaining contingent consideration liability was measured at €1.7 million."
"The change since 
December 31, 2022 (value: €72.1 million) mainly reflects adjusted sales and sales expectations, respectively."
"Furthermore, the share price of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"and the discount rates applied to calculate the 
present value of the future obligation were adjusted to reflect the market rates on December 31, 2023."
"The 
difference between the valuation as of December 31, 2022, and the reporting date amounts to €70.4 million 
and was recognized in the financial result."
"The key input parameters for the valuation are the sales revenue expectations for the plan years as well as the 
share price of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
at the respective valuation date.
"The valuation results are less 
sensitive to realistic changes in other valuation parameters, e.g., the discount rates applied."
"Assuming 20 % 
higher (lower) sales revenues in each of the remaining relevant years of the plan period would result in an 
increase in the liability to be reported at the reporting date by approximately €1.7 million (decrease by 
approximately €1.1 million)."
"If the share price had been 20 % higher (lower) at the reporting date, the liability 
would have been €0.3 million higher (€0.3 million lower)."
"The actual future outcomes may differ from these 
sensitivities, which are determined by changing only the respective key input parameter in isolation."
"The lower 
end of the bandwidth of possible outcomes of the remaining variable third tranche of this contingent 
consideration is zero, while the upper limit cannot be quantified due to settlement in shares."
"For the contingent consideration agreed in connection with the acquisition of WaterSep BioSeparations, 
which is due in 2024, no material financial liability was recognized on the reporting date of December 31, 2023."
"The value change since December 31, 2022 amounting to €3.0 million was recognized in the financial result."
"In connection with the acquisition of Xell AG, the sellers were granted two additional earn-out components, 
which are due in 2024 and 2026 and depend on sales revenues in the years 2022 to 2025."
"On the reporting 
date of December 31, 2023, the fair value amounts to €0.1 million."
"The change since December 31, 2022 (value: 
€1.1 million) was recognized in the financial result."
"The lower (upper) end of the bandwidth of possible 
outcomes of the remaining second component of this contingent consideration remains zero (€18.3 million)."
"The remaining financial instruments recognized at fair value on the reporting date are mainly trade receivables 
of the entities participating in the factoring program that are therefore part of a portfolio that is “held-to-
collect-and-sell,” as well as derivatives in the form of forward contracts."
"These trade receivables are valued in 
the same way as trade receivables measured at amortized cost due to their short contractual maturities and 
immaterial credit risks."
"The derivatives were measured on the basis of their quoted exchange rates and market 
yield curves (Level 2)."
"The investment in the Swedish BICO Group AB (shareholding of about 10 %) acquired in December 2022 is 
measured at fair value according to IFRS 9."
"Due to the stock exchange listing on Nasdaq Stockholm, the fair 
Sartorius 
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes    Notes to the Statement of Financial Position

Start 
 
value is measured regularly on the basis of the current share price on the reporting date (Level 1)."
"The value 
changes of this investment are recognized in other comprehensive income in accordance with the policy 
choice provided by IFRS 9 due to the volatility resulting from the stock exchange listing."
"On the reporting date, 
the fair value of the investment amounted to €36.6 million (prior year: €67.7 million)."
"In fiscal 2023, the Group 
did not receive any dividends from BICO."
"The value change recognized in other comprehensive income in 
2023 amounts to about -€31.1 million (prior year: €16.5 million)."
"The remaining “financial investments” measured at fair value are measured on the basis of the most recent 
reliable indicators available as of the reporting date, e.g., on the basis of the most recent financing round, the 
latest investor’s updates, or at historical cost of acquisition (Level 3)."
"For the bonds issued in 2023, the respective market prices on the reporting date are used as an indicator of 
fair value (Level 1)."
"Subsequent to the 
acquisition of additional 25 % of the shares in the latter entity in fiscal 2023 (see Note 22), the liability for the 
remaining shares, which depends on sales revenue in the years 2023 to 2025 and is due in 2026, amounts to 
€78.9 million on the reporting date."
"Assuming 10 % higher (lower) sales revenues in each of the remaining years 
of the plan period would result in an increase in the liability to be reported at the reporting date of 
approximately €4.2 million (decrease of approximately €3.8 million)."
"The liability for the acquisition of the non-
controlling interest in ALS Automated Lab Solutions GmbH, which depends on sales revenue in 2025 and is 
also due in 2026, amounts to €17.1 million on the reporting date."
"Assuming 10 % higher (lower) sales revenues 
in each of the remaining years of the plan period would result in an increase in the liability to be reported at the 
reporting date of approximately €1.5 million (decrease of approximately €1.3 million)."
"The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities to be disclosed approximate the carrying 
amounts because of their predominantly short maturities."
"The maximum default risk is reflected by the 
carrying amounts of the financial assets recognized in the statement of financial position."
"The Group recognizes transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchies at the end of the reporting 
period during which the change has occurred."
"In the current reporting period, there were no transfers between 
the levels."
"Net Result for Financial Instruments 
The net gains and losses of the various categories of financial instruments are presented in the following table:  
Category acc."
"The valuation gains and losses for the investment in BICO Group AB recognized in other comprehensive 
income is separately presented under equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(see Note 35)."
"The net result of the remaining financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive 
income consists of income and expenses in connection with trade receivables that are not solely held to collect 
contractual cash flows, but may also be sold under the factoring program."
"The net result of liabilities measured at amortized cost mainly consists of the effects of foreign currency 
translation."
"Furthermore, we ensure that all Group companies operate under the premise of the going-concern principle."
"The financial liabilities described in Note 31 are regarded as managed capital, as are the cash and cash 
equivalents and equity capital."
"Goals of Financial Risk Management 
The Treasury Management unit of the Group coordinates access to national and international financial 
markets."
"In addition, the Treasury Management unit monitors and controls financial risks, which essentially 
entail currency, interest rate, liquidity, and credit risks."
"The Sartorius Group strives to minimize the impact of currency and interest rate risks using (derivative) 
financial instruments."
Hedging transactions and their control are carried out by different staff members.
Derivative financial instruments are traded for hedging purposes only.
"Management of Exchange Rate Risks and Hedge Accounting 
Management of Exchange Rate Risks 
The Group is exposed to currency risks, as approximately 60 % of its sales revenue is generated in foreign 
currencies and, of this amount, approximately three-quarters is generated in U.S."
"The 
remaining net currency exposures are hedged according to a cash flow at risk (CfaR) model within the limits 
of a risk budget with derivative financial instruments."
"The resulting hedge ratios reach up to 80 % for the 
relevant currencies, respectively."
"The Group generally follows a rolling hedging strategy of up to 12 months in 
advance."
"These hedging measures are reviewed at regular intervals in the light of current market risk 
parameters and adapted where necessary."
"The profit or loss resulting from the difference between the current and the previously agreed 
exchange rate is generally recognized as income or expense in the statement of profit or loss."
"The basis for the analysis of 
foreign currency risks are the expected cash inflows and outflows in foreign currencies (so-called net 
Sartorius 
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes    Notes to the Statement of Financial Position

exposures)."

The risk position of the Group is reflected by the CfaR that remains after considering all hedging activities of 
the Group."
"The CfaR approach takes into account the impact of possible currency fluctuations on the cash 
flows in foreign currencies (against the euro) on the basis of probability distributions."
"In this context, the 
covariances of the foreign currencies weighted with the net exposures serve as input factors for the estimation 
of portfolio volatility, which is decisive for determining the CfaR."
"Correlations between the currencies are taken 
into account in this method as risk is reduced in the risk aggregation."
"The possible negative impact on EBITDA is determined for each currency based on actual exchange rates and 
net exposures with a confidence level of 95 % for the next 12 months."

Hedge Accounting 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at the time of acquisition at cost and at fair value on subsequent 
reporting dates."
"The changes in value of the derivative financial instruments are generally recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss on the reporting date."
"If the derivative financial instruments are used to hedge cash flow risks arising from exchange rate risks and a 
qualifying hedging relationship exists based on the criteria of IFRS 9, the valuation adjustments for the 
effective portion are recognized in other comprehensive income."
"Only the change in the spot element of the 
forward contracts used as cash flow hedges are regularly designated."
"Amounts accumulated in equity are 
reclassified to profit or loss in other income and other expenses (see Note 11) in the same periods in which the 
hedged items affect profit or loss."
"The changes in the cash flow hedging reserves are shown in the statement 
of changes in equity and in the statement of comprehensive income."
"The non-designated or ineffective part 
is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the financial result."
"The critical terms match method is used to test the effectiveness of a hedging relationship; in other words, the 
economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the underlying hedged item is determined based 
on the consistency of the significant contractual features of the transactions."
"To this extent, the Group 
conducts a qualitative assessment."
"Hedge ineffectiveness may possibly arise if the timing of future 
transactions deviates from the original assumptions or the credit risk of the counterparties of the forward 
contract changes."

"Interest Risk Management 
In September 2023, the Group issued long-term, unsecured, fixed-rate bonds with a total volume of €3 billion 
and maturities of 3, 6, 9 and 12 years (see Note 31) via Sartorius Finance B.V., which was founded for financing 
purposes."
"To hedge interest rate risk for the period until the bond issuance, the Group had entered into 
interest rate swaps for a bond volume of €1.8 billion."
"The derivatives were designated as hedging instruments 
for the interest rate risk in connection with the planned bond issuance in accordance with IFRS 9."
"The changes 
in the value of the derivatives were thus initially recognized in other comprehensive income and are 
reclassified to profit or loss over the life of the bonds."
"At the time of the bond issuance, an amount of 
€6.3 million was recognized in other comprehensive income."
"Ineffectiveness in the amount of €1.7 million was 
recognized in the financial result."
"In fiscal 2023, an amount of €0.4 million was reclassified from the hedging 
reserve to the financial result."
"The entire Sartorius Group is generally financed through Sartorius AG and Sartorius Finance B.V., which use 
internal Group loans to ensure the financing of all Group companies."
"The Sartorius Group is exposed to 
interest rate risks, as some funds are taken out at variable interest rates."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Group 
Sartorius

predominantly obtained financing at fixed interest rates (approx."
"85 %), meaning that interest rate risk is 
currently of minor significance for the Group’s net worth, financial position, and earnings."
"Except for the 
interest rate hedge described above, as in the prior year, no interest rate hedges are currently being used to 
hedge against increasing interest rates."
"As of December 31, 2023, the volume of variable interest loans was around €601.3 million (prior year: 
€439 million)."
"If the market interest rate had been lower by 1.0 percentage point, the impact 
from the variable interest rate loans on the profit before taxes would have been €4.7 million (prior year: 
€0.9 million)."

"Local cash funds in certain countries (e.g., China and India) are only available to the Group for cross-border 
transactions subject to exchange controls."
"For the restrictions regarding local cash funds in Russia, see Note 4."
"As in the previous year, all derivative financial instruments of the Group are subject to the German Master 
Agreement for Financial Futures with regard to offsetting of the cash flows."
"As of December 31, 2023, 
derivative financial assets amounted to €7.1 million (prior year: €8.1 million) and derivative financial liabilities 
amounted to €2.2 million (€11.4 million), which were subject to framework agreements."
"On a net basis, 
derivative financial assets would have amounted to €5.3 million (prior year: €1.9 million) and derivative 
financial liabilities would have amounted to €0.4 million (€5.1 million) on December 31, 2023."
"The syndicated credit line amounting to €800 million at variable interest rates was not utilized as of December 
31, 2023 (utilization prior year: €80 million)."
"In addition, the Group had further bilateral credit lines at variable 
interest rates available until further notice amounting to around €470 million as of December 31, 2023 (prior 
year: €475 million)."
"On the reporting date, no material amounts had been drawn under these credit lines (prior 
year: €100 million)."
"As of December 31, 2023, there were no financing agreements that require the Group to comply with financial 
key ratios, so-called financial covenants."
"Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Sartorius Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations."
"Credit risks arise in particular from trade receivables as well as from cash and 
cash equivalents and bank deposits."
"Moreover, the Group is exposed to credit risks arising from derivatives 
with a positive fair value and, to a low degree, to other contractual cash flows from debt securities."
Credit risk is managed centrally for the Group by the Treasury Management unit.
"The creditworthiness of 
banks and financial institutions as counterparties of the Group is continuously monitored in order to detect 
increases in credit risks at an early stage."
"If no new information is obtained, the Group assumes that its related 
financial assets still have only a low credit risk."
"Customers are assigned to different risk limits, which are essentially based on business volume, past 
experience, and the net worth and financial situation of these customers."
"The management responsible for 
these customers regularly reviews compliance of their assigned customers with these credit limits."
"In some 
Sartorius 
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes    Notes to the Statement of Financial Position 
 
237 
 
 
Start 
 
cases, advance payments are required for deliveries to avoid credit risks."
"There are no significant 
concentrations of credit risks arising from individual customers or regions."
"For some trade receivables, the Group has collateral, such as guarantees, financial securities, and suretyship 
contracts to which the Group can resort under the contractual arrangements should a counterparty default 
on its payment obligations."
"No material collateral exists in relation to financial assets that are considered as 
credit-impaired on the reporting date."
"Impairment of Financial Assets 
Trade Receivables and Contract Assets 
Trade receivables and contract assets, in particular, are required to be measured according to the model for 
recognition of expected credit losses."
"The Sartorius Group applies the simplified impairment approach according to IFRS 9 for trade receivables and 
contract assets, thus taking lifetime expected credit losses into account."
"The impairment model starts with an 
analysis of the actual historical credit loss rates."
"These are adjusted, taking into consideration forward-looking 
information and the effects of current changes in the macroeconomic environment, if significant."
"Due to the 
immaterial level of historical credit losses, the Group continues to determine the expected credit losses for its 
portfolio of trade receivables as a whole."
"However, historical loss rates are analyzed regularly in more detail in 
order to apply different loss rates to different portfolios if necessary."
"Contract assets relate to projects for 
typical Sartorius customers so that the Group assumes that the loss rates applied to trade receivables 
appropriately approximate the loss rates of the contract assets."
"Accordingly, there is no further differentiation 
between trade receivables and contract assets."
"On this basis, the allowances for trade receivables and contract assets were determined as follows for the year 
ended December 31, 2023, and as of the previous reporting date on December 31, 2022: 
Dec."
The expected credit losses are determined based on a loss rate of 0.05 %.
"In addition, impairments are 
determined on the basis of individual assessments."
Days overdue are one essential criterion in this context.
"A 
default is generally presumed when there is no longer any reasonable expectation of recovering a financial 
asset."
"In such a case, the respective receivables are derecognized."
"The expected 
credit losses are monitored at regular intervals."
"Due to the high creditworthiness of the counterparties and the 
short maturities or contract terms, which are short by definition, any impairment that would theoretically have 
to be recognized for these financial assets is immaterial."
"Therefore, no impairment is recognized for cash and 
cash equivalents."
"Other Financial Assets 
For the other financial assets measured at amortized cost, as in the previous year, no impairment was 
recognized as of December 31, 2023 for the twelve months of expected credit losses due to immaterial 
historical credit losses."
"In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, which is generally presumed when a 
payment is more than 30 days past due, the lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for the respective 
financial asset."
"A default is generally presumed if there is no longer any reasonable expectation of recovering 
a financial asset."
This is generally presumed when payments are more than 90 days past due.
"As of the 
reporting date, there are no indications of increases in credit risk to a material extent."
"The carrying amounts of 
the financial assets reflect the maximum credit loss for these assets at the end of the fiscal year."
"Other Risks Associated with Financial Instruments 
As of the reporting date December 31, 2023, the Sartorius Group was exposed to risks arising from the volatility 
of the share price of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A."
"because of the contingent consideration in connection with 
the acquisition of BIA Separations."
"Furthermore, risks result from the volatility of the share price of BICO 
Group AB."
"The Group’s investment in this Swedish stock-listed company is measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income on the reporting date in the consolidated financial statements."
"As of the 
reporting date, there were no other significant risks of volatility in share prices; only vested portions of share-
based payments are linked directly to the price development of Sartorius stock (see Note 42)."
"For details on other types of risk, please refer to the Group Management Report."
"Share-Based Payments 
Within the Sartorius Group, share-based payments are made in the form of so-called phantom stock units at 
Sartorius AG as well as in the context of the so-called Long-Term Incentive Program (LTI Program)."
"In fiscal 2022, the Group introduced a new long-term remuneration component for selected employees at the 
higher management levels, the so-called LTI Program."
"At the beginning of a calendar year, each participant of 
Sartorius 
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes    Notes to the Statement of Financial Position

Start 
 
this program is granted virtual preference shares of Sartorius AG that will be paid out in cash after four years."
"Accordingly, the payment for the tranche of virtual shares granted in 2022 (2023) is planned for the first 
quarter of 2026 (2027)."
"The number of virtual shares varies with the performance achieved over the four years 
preceding the payout period."
"Goals are defined for the dimensions organic sales growth, underlying EBITDA 
margin, and CO2 emission intensity, which are equally weighted."
"The measurement of the share-based 
payment obligations is based on the performance achieved to date, assumptions about future performance in 
the remaining years until payment, and the current share price."
"The income from granting and measuring the 
virtual shares amounted to €0.2 million in fiscal 2023 (prior year: expense: €0.6 million)."
"The fair value of the 
obligation on the reporting date of December 31, 2023 amounted to €0.4 million (prior year: €0.6 million) and 
is reported under “Other non-current provisions” (see Note 24)."
The phantom stock units are virtual options on the shares of Sartorius AG.
"Specifically, the company’s phantom 
stock plan credits each member of the Executive Board at the beginning of every year with phantom stock 
units valued at an agreed amount."
"These phantom stock options may be exercised no earlier than four years 
after this sum has been credited and only if certain conditions with respect to the performance of Sartorius AG 
shares are met."
"If an Executive Board member exercises an option, the number of phantom stock units granted 
is evaluated at the current stock exchange price."
The amount paid out is capped at 2.5 times the grant price.
"The fair value of the phantom stock units was measured using a Black-Scholes model and is disclosed as 
follows:

"As in the prior year, no phantom stock units were exercisable on the reporting date."
"All 
phantom stock units granted in the reporting year were attributable to members of the Executive Board."
"The members of the Executive Board were each granted a supplementary compensation component, which 
provides for transferring shares of the company to them."
"These share-based payments are subject to the rules 
of IFRS 2."
"Based on the agreed conditions, the resulting amounts are to be spread as an employee benefits 
expense from the respective grant date over the full vesting period of the respective plan."
"In fiscal 2023, an 
amount of €0.6 million (prior year: €1.3 million) was therefore recognized as an employee benefits expense 
resulting from the granting of shares."
"For further details on the phantom stocks and the share-based 
remuneration of the Executive Board members, please refer to the Remuneration Report."

Acquisition of Polyplus 
 
 
The Sartorius Group acquired PolygenX A SAS, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France, for a purchase price of 
€2,226 million on July 18, 2023."
"Taking into account the acquired net assets in the amount of €523 million, the 
provisional purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of €1,703 million."
"Among other things, technologies 
in the amount of €790 million and customer relationships in the amount of €48 million were recognized as 
separate components of acquired net assets in the provisional purchase price allocation."
"OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
 
 
We evaluated the expertise, competence and objectivity of the independent expert entrusted by Sartorius 
with preparing the purchase price allocation."
"Using our knowledge of Polyplus’ business model, we also 
examined the process used to identify the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to evaluate its consistency 
with the requirements of IFRS 3."
"We examined the valuation methods applied for consistency with accounting 
policies."
"Sartorius

We discussed the expected development of sales and margins used in the provisional purchase price 
allocation with those responsible for planning."
"We discussed the parameters used in measuring the intangible 
assets with the independent expert and viewed the documentation on which they were based."
"We compared 
the assumptions and data underlying the cost of capital – particularly the risk-free interest rate, market risk 
premium and beta factor – with our own assumptions and with publicly available data."
"To evaluate mathematical accuracy, we reproduced selected calculations using a risk-oriented approach."
"Finally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes with respect to the acquisition of Polyplus are 
complete and appropriate."
"OUR CONCLUSION 
The process used to identify and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is appropriate and 
consistent with the applicable accounting policies."
"The significant assumptions and data are appropriate in the 
context of the provisional nature of the purchase price allocation."
"The presentation in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements is complete and appropriate."
