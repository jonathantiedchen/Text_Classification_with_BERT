"Siemens comprises Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), a stock corporation under the Federal laws of Germany, as the parent 
company, and its subsidiaries."
"Our Company is incorporated in Germany, with our corporate headquarters situated in Munich."
"As of 
September 30, 2023, Siemens had around 320,000 employees."
"Furthermore, we report results for Portfolio 
Companies, which comprises businesses that are managed separately to improve their performance."
"Our reportable segments and Portfolio Companies may do business with each other, leading to corresponding orders and revenue."
"Such 
orders and revenue are eliminated on Group level."
"Non-financial matters of the Group and Siemens AG 
Siemens has policies for environmental, employee and social matters, for the respect of human rights, and anti-corruption and bribery 
matters, among others."
Our business model is described in chapters 1 and 3 of this Combined Management Report.
"Reportable information 
that is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance, position and the impact of our activities on these matters is 
included in this Combined Management Report, in particular in chapters 3 through 7."
"Forward-looking information, including risk 
disclosures, is presented in chapter 8."

"Financial performance system 
2.1 Revenue growth 
In the Siemens Financial Framework we aim to achieve a revenue growth range of 5% to 7% per year on a comparable basis over a cycle 
of three to five years."
"Currency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current 
period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period."
"For calculating the percentage 
change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period."
"A portfolio effect arises in the case of an 
acquisition or a disposition and is calculated as the change year-over-year in revenue related to the transaction."
"For calculating the 
percentage change, this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period."
"Any portfolio effect is excluded for the twelve 
months following the relevant transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change."
"For orders, 
we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above."
"2.2 Profitability and capital efficiency 
Within the Siemens Financial Framework, we aim to achieve over a cycle of three to five years margins that are comparable to those of 
our relevant competitors."
"Therefore, we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which also consider the profit 
margins of their respective relevant competitors."
Profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue.
"For our industrial businesses, profit represents EBITA adjusted for amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations."
"In line with common practice in the financial services business, our financial indicator for measuring capital efficiency at SFS is return on 
equity after tax, or ROE after tax."
"ROE is defined as SFS’ profit after tax, divided by its average allocated equity."
"Primary measure for managing and controlling profit and profitability at Group level: Net income is the primary driver of basic earnings 
per share from net income (EPS) as well as of EPS before purchase price allocation accounting (EPS pre PPA) which is used for our capital 
market communication."
"EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets 
acquired in business combinations and related income taxes."
"As with EPS, EPS pre PPA includes the amounts attributable to shareholders 
of Siemens AG."
We aim to achieve high-single-digit annual growth in EPS pre PPA over a cycle of three to five years.
We seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders.
"For purposes of 
managing and controlling our capital efficiency, we use return on capital employed, or ROCE, as our primary measure in our Siemens 
Financial Framework."
Our goal is to achieve a ROCE within a range of 15% to 20% over a cycle of three to five years.
"2.3 Capital structure 
Sustainable revenue and profit development is supported by a healthy capital structure."
"Accordingly, a key consideration within the 
Siemens Financial Framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to 
repay and service our debt obligations over time."
"Our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of 
Industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations)."
"This financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would 
be needed to cover Industrial net debt through income from continuing operations, without taking into account interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortization."
We aim to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5.
"2.4 Liquidity and dividend 
We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders."
"In the Siemens Financial Framework, we strive for a dividend per 
share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or at least matches it."
"As in the past, we intend to fund the dividend payout from Free cash flow."
"Our primary measure to assess our ability to generate cash, 
and ultimately to pay dividends, is the cash conversion rate for the Siemens Group, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow (continuing and 
discontinued operations) to net income."
"Over a cycle of three to five years, we aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual 
comparable revenue growth rate."
"Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by Siemens shareholders at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on 
February 8, 2024."
The prior-year dividend was €4.25 per share.
"2 Effects resulting from purchase price allocation for Varian Medical Systems, Inc."
"(Varian) which are comprised of amortization of tangible and intangible assets, inventory step-ups, deferred revenue adjustments and  
  related income taxes."
"For purposes of calculating ROCE in interim periods, Income before interest after tax is annualized."
"Average capital employed is determined 
using the average of the respective balances as of the quarterly reporting dates for the periods under review."
"Segment information 
3.1 Overall economic conditions 
Overall, calendar 2023 was characterized by many headwinds for the global economy."
"After calendar 2022, in which global gross 
domestic product (GDP) increased by 3.1%, calendar 2023 is expected to show global GDP increasing by 2.6%, which shows a remarkable 
resilience of the global economy, given the number of big negative shocks of the previous year."
"In the post-pandemic world, consumption patterns of households continued to normalize."
"In particular, the shift to goods from services 
triggered by COVID-19 ended and then reversed, with a strong rebound of the service sector including tourism, and a normalization of 
goods demand."
"In addition, in light of much higher interest rates many firms started to reduce their inventory levels, which they had 
previously elevated as a precautionary measure to ensure production and delivery during periods of supply chain bottlenecks."
"Accordingly, 
both global goods demand and trade were significantly weaker in calendar 2023."
"These trends were primary contributors for the significant slowdown of the Chinese economy during calendar 2023, after it started very 
dynamically in the first quarter of calendar 2023 following lifting of severe COVID-19 lockdowns."
"Another main contributor for the 
slowdown was the intensification of the country’s real estate crisis."
"Hence, China’s GDP is expected to grow by only 5% in calendar 2023, 
which is regarded as low because under multiple lockdowns in calendar 2022, China delivered GDP growth of only 3% and some catching-
up in 2023 was expected."
economy was a positive surprise.
"Although monetary policy was substantially tightened and the main policy interest rate was 
increased to 5.5%, consumption and investment were strong and GDP is expected to expand by 2.5% in calendar 2023."
"In particular the 
labor market was robust and unemployment remained at historic lows."
"Despite the strong economy, inflation and core inflation rates 
declined substantially."
"By end of calendar 2023, consumer price inflation is expected to be approximately 3%, after it reached nearly 6.5% 
at the end of calendar 2022."
"Receding global commodity and energy prices and the dissolvement of supply chain bottlenecks both helped 
ease inflation while tighter monetary policy had the desired effect of anchoring inflation expectations."
"avoid a price-
wage-price spiral which could have led to structurally higher inflation rates."
"showed stronger economic growth than expected, the European Union (E.U.) experienced the difficulties that were widely 
expected."
"The drastic increase of energy prices in calendar 2022, a result of the war in Ukraine, had a severe negative impact, especially 
on energy-intensive industries."
"Strong increases in inflation rates led the European Central bank to increase the main policy interest rate 
to 4.5% which weighed on fixed investment, especially in the real estate sector."
"Moreover, the global manufacturing and trade slowdown 
mentioned above weighed on the E.U., due in particular to the high concentration of manufacturing and export industries in Germany, 
the region’s largest economy."
GDP growth in calendar 2023 is expected to be 0.4% in the E.U.
"Only the service 
sector, in particular tourism, supported the overall E.U."
"The partly estimated figures presented here for GDP are based on an S&P Global report dated October 15, 2023."
"Digital Industries also provides process control systems, 
machine-to-machine communication products, sensors (for measuring pressure, temperature, level, flow rate, distance or shape) and 
radio frequency identification systems."
"Furthermore, Digital Industries offers production and product lifecycle management (PLM) 
software, and software for simulation and testing of mechatronic systems."
"Digital Industries also provides customers with lifecycle and data-
driven services."
"Taken together, Digital Industries’ offerings enable customers to optimize entire value chains from product design and development 
through production and post-sale services."
"With its advanced software solutions in particular, Digital Industries supports customers in their 
evolution towards the “Digital Enterprise,” resulting in increased flexibility and efficiency of production processes and reduced time to 
market for new products."
"The most important customer markets include the automotive industry, the machine-building industry, the 
pharmaceutical and chemicals industry, the food and beverage industry and the electronics and semiconductor industry."
"Digital Industries 
serves its customers through a common regional sales organization spanning all its businesses, using various sales channels depending 
on the type of customer and industry and also enhancing customer choice across all channels."
"Changes in customer demand, especially 
for standard products, are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short-term fluctuation in Digital Industries’ 
profitability."
"Volume from large contracts in the software business, particularly for EDA, may also result in strong fluctuations in quarterly 
volume and profitability."
"The transition held back revenue growth rates and profit margin development in the 
software business in fiscal 2023 and Digital Industries expects continued impacts until completion of the transition."
"Competition with 
Digital Industries’ business activities comes primarily from multinational corporations that offer a relatively broad portfolio and from 
smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets."
Digital Industries sees three trends influencing its business and providing long-term growth opportunities.
"Producers of investment goods 
in today’s increasingly digital environment must modernize their production capacity, particularly to increase production flexibility and 
reduce time to market."
"This environment also spurs producers to complement their core products with vertical solutions and service 
Combined Management Report

offerings, which their customers either need or want in order to take full advantage of the investment goods."
"Finally, there is a trend from 
globalization to regionalization, to support local economic development, to increase supply chain resilience or to better adapt solutions to 
local needs."
This is increasingly accompanied by more differentiated regulatory requirements.
"Research & Development (R&D) activities at Digital Industries are aimed at innovative ways to merge the real and digital worlds with a 
continuous flow of data, so that customers can improve their products, production and resource efficiency."
"Digital Industries’ innovations 
incorporate artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing, SaaS and software-defined control, among other advanced technologies."
"Industrial Operations X focuses on integrating IT capabilities 
such as AI, low-code programming, edge computing, and cloud computing with automation technology and digital services."
"Through 
various collaborations, Digital Industries is developing industrial-grade AI solutions."
"With Intrinsic, an Alphabet company, Digital Industries 
collaborates to accelerate the integration of AI-based robotics and automation technology."
"Digital Industries and Microsoft are harnessing 
generative AI to help industrial companies drive innovation and efficiency across the entire product lifecycle."
"Major investments of Digital Industries in fiscal 2023 relate to its own factory automation, motion control and process automation 
businesses, to further automate and digitalize facilities particularly in Germany, China and Singapore."

"The short-cycle factory automation and the motion control businesses were affected most strongly due 
particularly to destocking at customers."
"These declines were partly offset by significant growth in the software business, due to large 
contract wins in both the PLM and the EDA businesses."
"Revenue rose on increases in all businesses due in part to conversion from the 
order backlog which had expanded significantly in the previous fiscal year."
"The strongest revenue growth contributions came from the 
factory automation and the process automation businesses."
"Overall, growth in the automation businesses was supported by improved 
availability of components year-over-year."
"Revenue growth in the software business was led by the EDA business while year-over-year 
growth in PLM was held back by the transition to SaaS."
"On a geographic basis, orders remained stable in the Americas region, but came in 
lower in the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East and in the region Asia, Australia due mainly to weaker demand in China."
"Revenue 
grew in all regions with the strongest contribution coming from the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East."
"Profit and profitability at 
Digital Industries rose on strong improvements in all automation businesses, supported by higher capacity utilization and a more favorable 
business mix including improved availability of components for high-margin products."
"Profit in the software business declined due to 
increased expenses related to cloud-based activities including severance charges, which for Digital Industries overall rose to €109 million, 
up from €64 million in the prior year."
"At the beginning of fiscal 2024, business activities in the areas of low-voltage and geared motors and motor spindles, previously part of 
Digital Industries’ motion control business, were transferred to Portfolio Companies."
"If the transfer to Portfolio Companies had already 
existed at the beginning of fiscal 2023, Digital Industries would have posted orders of €19.387 billion, revenue of €20.636 billion, profit 
of €4.833 billion and a profit margin of 23.4%."
"At the beginning of fiscal 2024, Digital Industries’ order backlog amounted to €11 billion, 
of which €8 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024."
"In fiscal 2023, markets served by Digital Industries overall grew significantly."
"However, after a strong start, growth momentum 
increasingly slowed over the course of the fiscal year."
This was particularly evident in China.
"On a geographic basis, all regions contributed 
to growth, led by the regions Americas and Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East."
"While global supply chain constraints eased, high price 
inflation led central banks to increase interest rates, which together with high energy costs impacted manufacturing industries."
"This 
impacted predominantly consumer- and building-related industries whereas production of investments goods still benefited from 
converting high order backlogs into current revenue."
"The entire manufacturing industry experienced a destocking of inventories as a 
countereffect of proactive ordering in the previous fiscal year."
"This was most evident in distributor channels and resulted in a significant 
decline in orders for automation equipment."
"Discrete industries, which are closer to consumer spending than process industries, were 
impacted earlier and more strongly than process industries, which are more project-based."
"The global automotive industry recovered 
throughout the year following a weak prior year, and benefited from improved supply chain conditions."
"Production of electric vehicles 
continued to increase."
"On a geographic basis, China, Japan, the U.S."
"and countries of the European Union saw a strong catchup of 
production mainly in the first half of the fiscal year."
"Within the pharmaceutical and the chemicals industries, the pharmaceutical industry grew throughout 
the fiscal year, but with slower momentum towards the end of the fiscal year."
"In contrast, production in the chemicals industries declined 
in fiscal 2023."
This was particularly evident within the countries of the European Union due mainly to high energy costs.
"The food and 
beverage industry grew strongly at the beginning of the fiscal year, driven by strong price increases."
"In the second half of the fiscal year, 
growth slowed considerably, reflecting weaker consumer spending."
"The market for electronics and semiconductors declined markedly at 
the beginning of fiscal 2023 but began to stabilize during the second half of the fiscal year."
"The decline, which was particularly evident in 
countries such as Taiwan and Korea with a focus on semiconductor production, was due among other factors to shrinking consumer

demand following unusually high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"For fiscal 2024, markets served by Digital Industries are 
expected to grow markedly slower than in fiscal 2023."
"While industrial software markets are expected to grow clearly, short-cycle markets 
served by Digital Industries are expected to contract slightly."
"Among other factors, rebalancing of supply chains, trade conflicts, effects 
from geopolitical tensions, cautious consumer spending and downsizing of inventories, mainly in distribution channels, are expected to 
weigh on market growth."
"3.3 Smart Infrastructure

developed a balanced and resilient business mix with its diversified regional and vertical markets; its range of products, systems, solutions 
and services; and its participation in both long- and short-cycle markets."
"To further strengthen the resilience of its portfolio, Smart 
Infrastructure aims to increase the share of overall revenue that comes from services."
Smart Infrastructure benefits from a number of major trends.
"These include urbanization, demographic change, decarbonization, and 
digitalization."
Urbanization and demographic change drive a need for smarter and more human-centric buildings.
"Climate change drives 
the need for decarbonization and digitalization."
"This results in an increasing demand for flexible and resilient energy infrastructures 
including rapid growth in electric mobility and more sustainable buildings."
"Digitalization is an enabler for such changes in both buildings 
and grids, making it possible to develop smarter buildings and manage electricity distribution with a higher share of renewables."

Smart Infrastructure showed very strong performance in fiscal 2023."
"Orders increased clearly compared to the high prior-year level, which 
included proactive purchasing by customers."
"Growth was mainly driven by the electrification business and included a number of larger 
contract wins from data center, semiconductor, power distribution and battery manufacturing customers."
"Revenue rose in all businesses, 
with the strongest growth contributions coming from the electrification and the electrical products businesses."
"On a geographic basis, 
orders and revenue rose in all three reporting regions."
"The strongest growth contribution came from the Americas region, driven by the 
U.S., while growth in the Asia, Australia region was held back by declines in China, which were due mainly to negative currency translation 
effects."
Profit also rose in all businesses.
"Growth in profit and profitability was driven by the electrical products and the electrification 
businesses due to higher revenue, by increased capacity utilization and by cost reductions achieved through the execution of Smart 
Infrastructure’s competitiveness program."
"Severance charges were €50 million, up from €28 million a year earlier."
"At the end of fiscal 
2023, Smart Infrastructure’s order backlog was €16 billion, of which €10 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024."
"Overall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew clearly in fiscal 2023."
"Market dynamics were influenced by a further recovery from 
COVID-19-related effects; easing of supply chain and logistics constraints, which resulted in shorter lead times for order fulfillment; strong 
price inflation; and effects from the war in Ukraine."
"Furthermore, rising interest rates burdened building construction markets."
"On a 
geographic basis, all reporting regions contributed to growth."
Price inflation affected all regions and was particularly high in the U.S.
"While 
on the one hand rising interest rates impacted growth in the U.S., economic activity was boosted by stimulus programs on the other hand."
"In China, the recovery from lockdown measures was significantly weaker than expected, which also impacted growth dynamics in other 
countries, while Europe was most strongly affected by the war in Ukraine and high energy prices."
"Grid markets grew clearly, driven by 
demand for integration of energy from renewable resources."
"Industrial markets also grew clearly on strong demand in the battery, 
semiconductor, and automotive industries."
"The buildings market overall also grew but activity in the commercial building market rose only 
moderately."
"In fiscal 2024, markets served by Smart Infrastructure are expected to grow clearly but at a slower pace than in fiscal 2023 
due to a substantially lower effect from price inflation and a cooling of the general economic environment."
"While growth is expected to 
be weak in residential and commercial building markets and in some industrial markets, continued robust demand is expected for data 
centers and power distribution."
"Overall, market development in fiscal 2024 is expected to continue to be influenced by rebalancing of 
supply chains, trade conflicts and effects from geopolitical tensions."
"3.4 Mobility 
Mobility combines all Siemens businesses in the area of rail passenger and rail freight transportation."

"Mobility’s software business comprises train planning systems, trip planning, mobile ticketing, Mobility as a 
Service (MaaS) platforms, on-demand transportation and fleet management, data analytics, and inventory and reservation management."
"Mobility sells its products, systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales and execution units."
"The principal customers of 
Mobility are public and state-owned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors, so its markets are driven primarily by public 
spending."
"Customers usually have multi-year planning and implementation horizons, and their contract tenders therefore tend to be 
independent of short-term economic trends."
"Large contracts in the rolling stock and the rail infrastructure business are often awarded 
together with service contracts, which start to generate revenue only after the respective products and solutions have been put in 
operation, which can be a number of years after the contract award."
Mobility’s principal competitors are multinational companies.
"Consolidation among Mobility’s competitors is continuing and may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail transport industry 
and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers."
"The main trends driving Mobility’s markets are urbanization, decarbonization and digitalization."
"Increasing populations in urban centers 
need daily mobility that is simpler, faster, and more flexible, reliable and affordable."
"At the same time, cities and national economies face 
the challenge of cutting CO2 and noise emissions and reducing space requirements and costs of transportation."
"The pressure on mobility 
providers to meet all these needs is expected to rise continuously."
"Furthermore, improving availability, connectivity, and sustainability of 
rail infrastructures increasingly requires digital solutions, which generates growth opportunities for providers of such solutions."
"IoT systems 
and new software-based solutions such as MaaS are expected to become major growth enablers for the rail industry."
"Overall trends towards 
urbanization, decarbonization and digitalization persist and many countries have been allocating significant funds to rail and public 
transport operators to address these trends."
"Mobility’s R&D strategy is focused on reducing life-cycle costs of rail infrastructure and rolling stock, securing system availability, 
increasing network capacity of rail infrastructure, optimizing the processes of rail operators and improving passenger experience."
"With 
Siemens Xcelerator, Mobility intends to make software more modular and increasingly move it to the cloud."
"At the same time, Mobility

Order intake at Mobility exceeded the record level a year earlier on sharply higher volume from large orders."
"Contract wins in fiscal 2023 
were highlighted by an order worth €2.9 billion for locomotives and associated maintenance in India, a €2.5 billion order for the first line 
of a turnkey rail system in Egypt and a €2.1 billion order for suburban trains in Germany."
"Order intake a year earlier included among others 
an order worth €1.5 billion for high-speed trains in Germany."
"Revenue rose on growth in nearly all businesses with the strongest 
contribution coming from the rolling stock business, and was supported by improved availability of components."
"On a geographic basis, 
revenue grew in all three reporting regions."
"Nominal volume development was held back by the fiscal 2022 divestment of Yunex Traffic, 
resulting in a portfolio effect which took four percentage points from order growth and five percentage points from revenue growth in 
the current period."
"As with revenue, profit and profitability rose in nearly all businesses."
"Profit in fiscal 2023 included a positive €0.2 billion 
in trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities in Russia a year earlier, which burdened prior-year profit by €0.6 billion 
in impairments and other charges."
"In addition, profit in fiscal 2022 included impacts from supplier delays and COVID-19 effects."
"These 
burdens were largely offset by a gain of €0.7 billion from the sale of Yunex Traffic."
"Severance charges were €25 million, compared to €27 
million a year earlier."
"Mobility’s order backlog rose to €45 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which €11 billion are expected to be 
converted into revenue in fiscal 2024."
"Markets served by Mobility grew significantly in fiscal 2023, supported by long-term trends such as urbanization, decarbonization and 
increasing demand for digital solutions."
"Market dynamics in fiscal 2023 also benefited from receding material shortages and easing of 
supply chain constraints."
"On a geographic basis, all regions contributed to market growth, highlighted by large and very large orders in 
Germany, the U.S., Egypt and India, among others."
"The market for rolling stock included large orders for high-speed trains, commuter 
trains and locomotives in Europe, India and Egypt."
"Growth in North America included major investments in new and existing fleets, 
especially for urban transport."
"Growth in the rail infrastructure market was driven mainly by digitalization, deployment of ETCS technology 
and track electrification, for example with projects in Europe and Asia."
"For fiscal 2024, markets served by Mobility are expected to grow 
clearly, benefiting from the above-mentioned trends and with all reporting regions contributing to growth."
"Market expansion is expected 
to be supported by a large number of public investment programs."
"In Asia, markets 
in India are expected to grow strongly with investments in mainline transport (high-speed trains, freight infrastructure, rolling stock fleet 
renewals and expansions of large commuter rail and locomotive tenders), urban metros and rail electrification driving growth."
"3.5 Siemens Healthineers 
Siemens as majority shareholder holds just over 75% of the shares of the publicly listed Siemens Healthineers AG, Germany."
"Siemens 
Healthineers is a global provider of healthcare products, solutions and services."
"It develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of 
diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers."
"In addition, Siemens Healthineers also provides clinical 
consulting services, as well as an extensive range of training and service offerings."
"This comprehensive portfolio supports customers along 
the entire care continuum, from prevention and early detection through to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care."
"The imaging business provides imaging products, services, and solutions as 
well as digital offerings."
"Its most important products are devices for magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, X-ray, molecular 
imaging, and ultrasound."
"The diagnostics business comprises in-vitro diagnostic products and services that are offered to healthcare 
providers in the fields of laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics."
"The Varian business provides multi-modality cancer care technologies 
along with solutions and services to oncology departments in hospitals and clinics."
"The portfolio of the advanced therapies business 
consists of highly integrated products, services, and solutions across multiple clinical fields that are designed to support image-guided 
minimally invasive treatments, in areas such as cardiology, interventional radiology, and surgery."
"Markets of Siemens Healthineers are characterized by long-term stability, though, over 
the long term, these markets may also experience shorter-term fluctuations arising from macroeconomic and health political 
developments, such as changes in health policy, regulation or reimbursement systems."
"Because a substantial portion of Siemens 
Healthineers’ revenue stems from recurring business, growth opportunities can be pursued from a stable foundation of profit."
The addressable markets of Siemens Healthineers are shaped by four major trends.
"The first is demographic developments, in particular 
the growing and aging global population."
"This trend poses major challenges for global healthcare systems and, at the same time, offers 
an opportunity for healthcare providers as the demand for cost-efficient healthcare solutions increases."
"The second trend is economic 
development in emerging countries, which opens up improved access to healthcare for many people."
"Significant investment in the 
expansion of private and public healthcare systems will persist, driving overall demand for healthcare products and services and hence 
market growth."
"The third trend is the increase in non-communicable diseases as a consequence of an aging population and environmental 
and lifestyle-related changes."
"This trend results in far more patients with multiple morbidities, increasing the need for new ways to detect 
and treat diseases in a timely manner."
"The fourth global trend, the transformation of healthcare providers such as hospitals and 
Combined Management Report 
11 
laboratories, results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their 
businesses differently."
"This development is driven partly by staff shortages, society’s increasing resistance to healthcare costs, the growing 
professionalization of health insurance and governmental healthcare systems, burdens from chronic diseases and the rapid scientific 
progress."
"The growing cost pressure will continue to drive new remuneration models for healthcare services such as value-based 
reimbursement instead of treatment-based reimbursement."
"As a result of these factors, there’s a trend of consolidation of healthcare 
providers into networks."
"The aim of the resulting larger clinic and laboratory chains, often operating internationally and acting increasingly 
like large corporations are systematic improvements in quality, while at the same time reducing costs."
"This development leads to an 
increased demand for standardized and scalable systems and solutions as well as new business models."
"R&D activities at Siemens Healthineers are aimed at offering innovative and sustainable solutions for diagnostics and therapy to its 
customers."
"Artificial intelligence, sensors, and robotics are focal points of the R&D activities at Siemens Healthineers."
"A growing share of 
the R&D activities is devoted to improving the sustainability of the products."
"Furthermore, the systems of Siemens Healthineers regularly 
receive extensive software releases to improve user friendliness and add innovative applications."
"Investments at Siemens Healthineers 
were mainly for spending for factories to expand manufacturing and technical capabilities, in particular in the U.S."
"and China, for measures 
related to improving operational efficiency and for additions to intangible assets, including capitalized development expenses for products 
within the Atellica product line."

In fiscal 2023, Siemens Healthineers recorded a decrease of orders, while revenue was on the prior-year level."
"While the imaging and 
Varian businesses in particular delivered growth in both orders and revenue, this was offset by a substantial decline in the diagnostics 
business."
"On a geographic basis, revenue was on the prior-year level in all regions; in the Asia, Australia region reported revenue was held 
back by negative currency translation effects."
"Profit declined primarily due to substantially lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen 
tests in the diagnostics business, which also recorded charges of €0.2 billion related to its transformation program."
"In addition, profitability 
was burdened by impairments and other charges totaling €0.3 billion due to a management decision to refocus certain activities in the 
advanced therapies business."
The imaging and Varian businesses increased their profit contributions on higher revenue.
"Severance charges 
were €167 million in fiscal 2023, compared to €71 million a year earlier."
"The order backlog for Siemens Healthineers was €34 billion at 
the end of the fiscal year, of which €11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024."
"In general, the addressable global markets of Siemens Healthineers excluding rapid coronavirus antigen tests grew moderately in fiscal 
2023."
"From a regional perspective, the Asia, Australia region saw market growth in most businesses; in China, government subsidy 
programs, among others, including the program of lending incentives associated with the economic stimulus package, had a positive 
effect on investment by healthcare providers."
"In the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East, government subsidy programs, among 
others, were able to support growth in most businesses."
"In the U.S., market growth was recorded in all businesses."
"Globally, higher volume 
in the market for the imaging business was generated thanks to the high level of order backlogs resulting from demand catch-up effects, 
on the one hand, and investments in diagnostic imaging equipment in reaction to announced price hikes, on the other hand."
"The imaging 
market is expected to grow moderately overall in fiscal 2024, driven mainly by pent-up demand for the major imaging modalities."
"Within 
the diagnostics business, demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests declined sharply after the COVID-19 pandemic ceased to be a global 
health emergency and the incidence of COVID-19 infections subsided."
"The market for the diagnostics business is expected to achieve slight 
growth in fiscal 2024, excluding COVID-19 testing."
"In the market for Varian, overall market growth, especially in the U.S."
"and Western 
Europe, was boosted mainly by increasing demand for product innovations and services as well as by an intact replacement market."
"For 
this reason, the market for Varian is expected to grow clearly in fiscal 2024."
"For advanced therapies business, government subsidy 
programs, including lending incentives enacted as part of the economic stimulus package in China along with EU investment programs, 
positively influenced market development."
"The expectation for the advanced therapies business is that the market will continue to grow 
moderately in fiscal 2024."
"3.6 Siemens Financial Services  
Siemens Financial Services provides financing solutions for Siemens’ customers as well as other companies in the form of debt and equity 
investments."
"Based on its comprehensive financing know-how and specialist technology expertise in the areas of Siemens businesses, SFS 
supports its customers’ investments with leasing, lending, working capital and structured financing solutions and offers a broad range of 
equipment and project financing."
"In addition, SFS supports Siemens’ industrial businesses with financial advisory services and via a joint 
go-to-market that includes SFS’s risk management expertise, such as to assess the risk profiles of projects or business models."
"Furthermore, 
SFS collaborates with Siemens’ industrial businesses to co-develop new digital business models, and also supports its customers through 
targeted financings in sustainable technologies and projects."
"In the prior period, earnings before taxes were burdened by €0.2 billion in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business 
in Russia at the end of the fiscal year."
The equity business recorded strong results.
"While both periods under review included gains from 
the sales of equity investments, fiscal 2022 additionally included higher gains from fair value measurements of investments and gains 
from energy-related investments in connection with rising prices in global energy markets."
"Net cash from operations (defined as the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities) amounted to €(733) million compared 
to €(616) million in fiscal 2022."
"Despite the increase in receivables from financing activities, total assets decreased since the end of fiscal 2022 due primarily to negative 
currency translation effects."
"SFS’s business scope and capital allocation is focused on areas of intense domain know-how closely aligned with Siemens’ customers and 
markets, particularly for Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Mobility."
"Accordingly, SFS is influenced by the business development 
of the markets served by the industrial businesses, among other factors, including macroeconomic effects such as inflation or recession 
which could impact the credit risk of customers."
"In addition to its high level of diversification across industries, SFS has a strong regional 
footprint in investment-grade countries, with the highest share in the U.S."
"SFS intends to maintain a highly diversified portfolio across 
regions, while participating in the strong economic development of selected Asian markets."
"Unrealized potential within these businesses requires adjustment in their approach using defined measures including internal 
re-organization, digitalization, cost improvements, and optimizing procurement, production and service activities."
"After achieving certain 
threshold performance targets, businesses may be combined with another business in the same industry, sold, placed into an external 
private equity partnership, or exited via a public listing."
"At the end of fiscal 2023, Portfolio Companies consisted mainly of three separately managed units: Large Drives Applications offers electric 
motors, converters and mining solutions."
"Siemens Logistics offers sorting technology and solutions focused on handling baggage and 
cargo in airports."
"Siemens Energy Assets comprises certain regional business activities of the former Gas and Power segment; as part of 
the Siemens Energy carve-out these activities remained so far with Siemens due to country-specific regulatory restrictions or economic 
considerations."
"Demand within the industries served by Portfolio Companies mainly shows a delayed response to changes in the overall economic 
environment."
"Financial results are strongly dependent, however, on customer investment cycles in their key industries."
"In commodity-
based industries such as oil and gas or mining, these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in 
produced volumes."
"The heterogonous industrial customer base of the separately managed units requires a dedicated sales approach based 
on in-depth understanding of specific industries and customer requests, resulting in the use of various sales and marketing channels for 
Portfolio Companies."

In fiscal 2023, orders and revenue increased in all businesses."
"While order growth was driven by higher volume from larger orders, most 
evidently at the Airport Logistics business of Siemens Logistics, revenue increased mainly at Large Drives Applications in part due to strong 
conversion of the order backlog."
"Primarily due to the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics in the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2022, portfolio effects took eleven and 13 percentage points from orders and revenue, respectively."
"The strong profit was 
driven by Siemens Energy Assets and Large Drives Applications."
"Additionally, Portfolio Companies recorded a gain of €0.1 billion from the 
sale of the Commercial Vehicles business."
"For comparison, profit in fiscal 2022 included a gain of €1.1 billion from the sale of the mail and 
parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and a revaluation gain of €0.3 billion in connection with the sale of the equity investment 
in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH."
"Portfolio Companies recorded lower severance charges of €12 million, down from €20 million in 
fiscal 2022."
"After the post-pandemic recovery, a normalizing growth momentum is expected in most end-customer vertical 
markets in fiscal 2024."
"If the transfer from Digital Industries had already existed at the beginning of fiscal 2023, Portfolio 
Companies would have posted orders of €5,317 million, revenue of €4,699 million, profit of €457 million and a profit margin of 9.7%."
"Portfolio Companies’ order backlog amounted to €5 billion at the beginning of fiscal 2024, of which €3 billion are expected to be converted 
into revenue in fiscal 2024."
"These gains were partly offset by Siemens’ share of Siemens Energy’s after-tax 
loss and expenses from amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation totaling €1.5 billion (fiscal 2022: totaling €0.2 
billion)."
"Financing, eliminations and other items included a revaluation loss of €0.2 billion on the stake in Thoughtworks Holding Inc."
"(fiscal 
2022: a loss of €0.3 billion)."
"For comparison, fiscal 2022 included also impacts totaling €0.5 billion at Corporate Treasury, resulting from 
the sale of Siemens’ financing and leasing business in Russia, as well as a loss of €0.1 billion resulting from applying hyperinflation 
accounting."
"These effects were partly offset in fiscal 2022 by a gain of €0.5 billion in connection with an investment accounted for using 
the equity method mainly due to fair value measurement."

"Smart Infrastructure recorded clear order 
growth, whereas Digital Industries showed a double-digit decline year-over-year from a high base of comparison, due to its automation

Infrastructure."
"Mobility reported clear revenue growth, which was held back by portfolio effects stemming from the sale of Yunex traffic 
in fiscal 2022."
Revenues at Siemens Healthineers decreased slightly.
"Within the region in Germany, the same pattern applied for Digital 
Industries and Smart Infrastructure, while revenues at Mobility came in flat."
"A decline in Germany at Siemens Healthineers was primarily 
due to lower demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests in the diagnostics business."
"In the Americas region, revenue was up in all four industrial businesses led by Smart Infrastructure with double-digit growth."

translation effects, which turned revenue development negative in China for Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries."
"Mobility also 
recorded a revenue decline in China."
"Severance charges for continuing operations were €430 million, of which €351 million were in Industrial Business."
"In fiscal 2022, 
severance charges for continuing operations were €272 million, of which €190 million were in Industrial Business."
"The tax rate in fiscal 2023 was 24% (fiscal 2022: 38%), benefiting from tax-free gains in relation to the partial reversal of an impairment 
on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V."
"Moreover, 
the gain recorded in connection with the capital increase by Siemens Energy AG was also tax-free."
"These positive influences on the tax 
rate were partly offset by our participation in the after-tax loss at Siemens Energy, which was not tax-deductible."
"As a result, the increase 
in Income from continuing operations was 93%."
"The increase in Basic EPS and in EPS pre PPA reflects the increase of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was 
€7,949 million in fiscal 2023 compared to €3,723 million in fiscal 2022, combined with a lower number of weighted average shares 
outstanding."
Our investment in Siemens Energy AG contributed €0.84 to the increase of EPS pre PPA.
"At 18.6%, ROCE was back in the target range established in our Siemens Financial Framework."
"The increase year-over-year was due 
primarily to sharply higher income before interest after tax."
"4.3 Research and development 
In fiscal 2023, we reported research and development expenses of €6.2 billion, compared to €5.6 billion in fiscal 2022."
"The resulting R&D 
intensity, defined as the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, was 8.0% (fiscal 2022: 7.8%)."
"Additions to capitalized development expenses 
amounted to €0.3 billion as in the prior year."
"As of September 30, 2023, Siemens worldwide held approximately 45,000 granted patents 
in its continuing operations."
"On average, we had 50,029 R&D employees in fiscal 2023."
"Our research and development activities are ultimately geared to developing innovative, sustainable solutions for our customers – and our 
businesses – while also strengthening our own competitiveness."
"Joint implementation by the operating units and Technology, our central 
R&D department, ensures that research activities and business strategies are closely aligned with one another, and that all units benefit 
equally and quickly from technological developments."
Siemens’ core technologies have been determined to be critical for our Company’s long-term success and that of our customers.
We advance technologies also through our open innovation concept.
"We work closely with scholars from leading universities, research 
institutions and academic start-ups, not only under bilateral cooperation agreements but also in publicly funded collective projects."
"Our 
focus here is on our strategic research partners and in particular the Siemens Research and Innovation Ecosystems, which we maintain at 
16 locations worldwide."
"Siemens’ global venture capital unit, Next47, provides capital to help start-ups expand and scale."
"It serves as the creator of next-generation 
businesses for Siemens by building, buying and partnering with innovative companies at any stage."
"Next47 is focused on anticipating how 
emerging technologies will influence our end markets."
"This foreknowledge enables our Company and our customers to grow and thrive 
in the age of digitalization."
"Combined Management Report

"The increase in other current financial assets was driven mainly by higher loans receivable at SFS, which were mainly due to new business 
and reclassification of loans receivable from other financial assets due to a reassessment of the expected repayment dates."
"The latter was 
a major factor also for the decrease of other financial assets, along with decreased positive fair values of derivative financial instruments."
"Inventories increased in all industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at Mobility and Siemens Healthineers."
"The decrease of other intangible assets resulted mainly from negative currency translation effects and from impairments recorded at 
Siemens Healthineers."
Our investment in Siemens Energy AG was the main factor for the decrease of investments accounted for using the equity method.

"This was partly offset by the repayment of euro, U.S."
dollar and British pound instruments totaling €4.6 billion.
"Long-term debt decreased due primarily to the above-mentioned reclassifications and currency translation effects of €1.9 billion on bonds 
issued in the U.S."
dollar and British pound.
Set against this were mainly increases of €2.5 billion from the issuance of euro bonds.
The contribution of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V.
"led to a decrease of provisions for pensions and similar 
obligations."
Additional major effects resulted from returns on plan assets and actuarial gains and losses.
"For further information see Note 
17 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for fiscal 2023."
"These factors were largely offset by 
€7.9 billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG."
"In fiscal 2023, Siemens cancelled 50 million treasury shares, thereby 
reducing issued capital by €150 million and retained earnings by €5.1 billion."
"Capital structure ratio 
Our capital structure ratio as of September 30, 2023 decreased to 0.6 from 1.0 a year earlier."
"The change was due to a decrease in Industrial 
net debt and a higher EBITDA."
"Debt and credit facilities 
As of September 30, 2023, we recorded, in total, €40.9 billion in notes and bonds, €2.2 billion in loans from banks, €0.5 billion in other 
financial indebtedness and €2.9 billion in lease liabilities."
Notes and bonds were issued mainly in the U.S.
"dollar and the euro, and to a 
lesser extent in the British pound."

Off-balance-sheet commitments 
As of September 30, 2023, the undiscounted amount of maximum potential future payments related primarily to credit and performance 
guarantees amounted to €6.2 billion."
"This included primarily Siemens’ obligations from performance and credit guarantees in connection 
with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy."
"In addition to these commitments, there are contingent liabilities of €0.4 billion which result mainly from other guarantees and legal 
proceedings."
"Other guarantees include €0.1 billion, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy."
Irrevocable loan commitments amounted to €3.9 billion.
"A considerable portion of these commitments resulted from asset-based lending 
transactions, meaning that the respective loans can be drawn only after the borrower has provided sufficient collateral."
"For further information about our commitments and contingencies see Notes 21 and 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
fiscal 2023."
"Share buyback 
The share buyback program announced on June 24, 2021 with a volume of up to €3 billion ending September 15, 2026, at the latest, 
began on November 15, 2021."
"This buyback is executed based on the authorization provided by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on 
February 5, 2020."
"In fiscal 2023, Siemens repurchased 6,853,091 shares under this share buyback program."
"On November 16, 2023 we 
announced a share buyback of up to €6 billion for up to five years."
"Cash outflows from changes in operating net working capital were due mainly to Siemens Healthineers which recorded a 
significant build-up of trade and other receivables as well as inventories due in part to the expected growth of business activities in coming 
quarters."
"Cash outflows for purchase of investments and financial assets for investment purposes included additions of assets eligible as central 
bank collateral and payments for debt or equity investments."
Cash outflows from change in receivables from financing activities of SFS related primarily to SFS’s debt business.
"Cash inflows from other disposals of assets included mainly proceeds from disposals of assets eligible as central bank collateral, from the 
sale of the Commercial Vehicles business by Portfolio Companies, and from the sale or disposal of debt or equity investments."
"Cash outflows from the re-issuance of treasury shares and other transactions with owners were driven by the purchase of Siemens 
Healthineers AG treasury shares."
"Combined Management Report 
19 
Cash outflows for dividends attributable to non-controlling interests mainly included dividends paid to the shareholders of Siemens 
Healthineers AG."
"Also in our opinion, 
our operating net working capital is sufficient for our present requirements."
"Investing activities 
Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment from continuing operations totaled €2.2 billion in fiscal 2023."
"Within 
the industrial businesses, ongoing investments related mainly to technological innovations; maintaining, extending and digitalizing our 
capacities for designing, manufacturing and marketing new solutions; improving productivity; and replacements of fixed assets."
"These 
investments amounted to €1.7 billion in fiscal 2023."
"The remaining portion related mainly to Siemens Real Estate, including significant 
amounts for projects such as new office buildings in Germany and Spain."
"Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive 
management of Company real estate worldwide (except for Siemens Healthineers) and supports the industrial businesses and corporate 
activities with customer-specific real estate solutions."
"With regard to capital expenditures, we expect a significant increase in fiscal 2024."
"In the context of the €2 billion investment strategy 
presented in fiscal 2023 to strengthen growth, innovation and resilience, significant amounts will be invested in the coming years for the 
construction and expansion of high-tech production facilities in the U.S., China and Singapore."
"As part of this investment strategy, Siemens 
also announced the establishment of its new Technology Campus in Erlangen, Germany, to expand development and manufacturing 
capacities."
"In addition, up to €0.6 billion are to be invested in Siemensstadt Square."
"This project, initiated in fiscal 2019, aims to transform 
Siemens’ existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes, including strengthening key 
technologies."
"Further investments are planned in relation to new office buildings, including Siemens Campus Erlangen."
"Furthermore, we 
continue to invest in attractive innovation fields through Next47, our global venture capital unit."
"Combined Management Report 
20 
7."
"Overall assessment of the economic position 
Overall, global economic development in fiscal 2023 was mixed and characterized by a number of headwinds."
"In this environment, 
Siemens delivered a very strong performance in all its businesses due to its strategic positioning relative to long-term trends such as 
automation, electrification and digitalization."
"With our offerings, we help increase resource efficiency and the decarbonization of industry, 
transport and building infrastructures and make manufacturing more resilient and flexible."
"We expect these trends to continue to drive 
our growth in the coming years."
"During fiscal 2023, we made further progress in focusing our business portfolio by selling our Commercial Vehicles business."
"Furthermore, 
we began forming a new motors and large drives company under the name Innomotics by combining our existing business activities in 
the areas of low- to high-voltage motors, geared motors, medium-voltage converters and motor spindles."
"Also, we further reduced our 
stake in Siemens Energy AG to 25.1% and transferred shares to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V."
"To boost future growth and drive innovation, 
we announced a €2 billion investment strategy mainly for new manufacturing capacity as well as innovation labs and education centers."
Fiscal 2023 was another very successful year for Siemens.
We raised our outlook during the fiscal year after the first and the second quarters.
"We then reached or exceeded all the 
targets set for our primary measures for fiscal 2023."
"We achieved revenue growth of 11% net of currency translation and portfolio effects 
and delivered EPS pre PPA of €10.77."
"Excluding Siemens Energy Investment, EPS pre PPA was €9.93."
"ROCE increased to 18.6%, our capital 
structure ratio came in at 0.6, and the cash conversion rate was 1.17."
"Orders rose 7% year-over-year to €92.3 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.19, thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above 1."
"Orders in Digital Industries came in lower as the destocking trend mentioned above had 
a significant effect on its automation businesses."
"Revenue was higher in nearly all our industrial businesses and rose to €77.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year."
"Smart Infrastructure and Digital 
Industries contributed double-digit growth with all businesses posting increases."
"Revenue growth at Smart Infrastructure was led by the 
electrification and the electrical products businesses, while at Digital Industries the factory automation and the process automation 
businesses contributed the strongest growth."
Revenue growth at Mobility was led by a significant increase in the rolling stock business.
"Revenue at Siemens Healthineers remained on the prior-year level as growth particularly in the imaging and Varian businesses was offset 
by a decline in the diagnostics business."
"Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens rose 11%."
"We thus 
exceeded the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2022, which was to achieve comparable revenue growth 
in the range of 6% to 9%, and reached the upper end of our subsequently raised outlook, which was to achieve 9% to 11% in comparable 
revenue growth."
Profit Industrial Business exceeded the record high of a year earlier and rose 11% to €11.4 billion.
"All industrial businesses except Siemens 
Healthineers increased their profit year-over-year."
"The strongest increase came from Smart Infrastructure on improvements in all its 
businesses, led by the electrical products and the electrification businesses."
"Growth at Digital Industries was driven by the automation 
businesses, only partly offset by a decline in profit in the software business due mainly to higher expenses related to cloud-based activities."
"Profit at Mobility increased in nearly all businesses and included positive trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities 
in Russia a year earlier."
"The profit margin of our Industrial Business rose to 15.4%, up from 15.1% a year earlier, reaching its highest level ever."
"Digital Industries 
and Smart Infrastructure achieved the strongest increases and also contributed the highest margins: 22.6% and 15.4%, respectively."
"The 
profit margin for Mobility rose slightly to 8.4%, while the profit margin at Siemens Healthineers declined to 11.7%."
"Earnings before taxes at SFS increased significantly due mainly to higher earnings before taxes in the debt business, which in the prior 
fiscal year included a €0.2 billion impact in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia."
"Return on equity after 
tax for SFS increased to 16.3%."
"Results within Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements benefited from positive effects related to Siemens 
Energy Investment, including €1.6 billion from a partial reversal of the prior-year €2.7 billion impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens 
Energy AG."
These positive effects were partly offset by Siemens’ share of Siemens Energy’s after-tax loss.
Net income nearly doubled year-over-year to a historic high of €8.5 billion and corresponding basic EPS more than doubled to €10.04.
"EPS 
pre PPA increased to €10.77."
"Excluding a positive €0.84 per share related to Siemens Energy Investment, EPS pre PPA was €9.93."
"ROCE for fiscal 2023 rose to 18.6%, up from 10.0% in fiscal 2022."
"This increase was due to sharply higher income before interest after tax 
year-over-year."
"We thus exceeded the forecast for ROCE provided in our Combined Management Report 2022, which was to come close 
to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%."
We evaluate our capital structure using the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA.
"Due to a combination of a decrease in Industrial net debt 
and higher EBITDA year-over-year, this ratio declined to 0.6."
"We thus achieved the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report 
2022, which was to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5."
"Combined Management Report 
21 
Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2023 was €10.0 billion, reaching a record high."
"The cash conversion 
rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to Net income, was 1.17."
"We thus 
achieved a cash conversion rate that contributed strongly to the average required to reach our target of 1 minus annual comparable 
revenue growth rate over a cycle of three to five years."
We intend to continue providing an attractive shareholder return.
"The Siemens Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, 
proposes a dividend of €4.70 per share, up from €4.25 per share a year earlier."

"Report on expected developments and associated material 
opportunities and risks 
8.1 Report on expected developments 
8.1.1 Worldwide economy 
The global economy showed remarkable resilience in calendar 2023, given the number of headwinds and negative economic shocks from 
the previous year."
"Nevertheless, these shocks still have adverse implications for economic growth in calendar 2024, especially the 
dampening effects of tighter financial conditions."
"Accordingly, in calendar 2024 the global economy is expected to further slow down to 
2.3% GDP growth, after 2.6% in calendar 2023."
"Given the high number of active and potential geopolitical conflicts, the outlook is subject 
to a high level of uncertainty."
"In the E.U., GDP is expected to increase by 0.8% in calendar 2024, after an anticipated growth of 0.4% in calendar 2023."
"The effects of the 
energy crisis still show negative impacts, especially in energy-intensive industries."
"Tighter monetary policy – the European Central Bank 
lifted the main policy interest rate to 4.5% in just over one year – also held back growth, particularly in the construction industry."
"The 
German economy is most impacted due to its proportionally large manufacturing sector and is expected to grow by only 0.5% in calendar 
2024."
economy is expected to decelerate to a soft landing.
"After unexpectedly strong GDP growth (expected to be +2.5%) in calendar 
2023, caused mainly by a very strong services sector while industry was weak, growth in calendar 2024 is expected to slow down to 1.6%."
"Tighter financial conditions – the Federal Reserve increased the main policy interest rate to 5.5% and longer-term interest rates also 
increased substantially – will unfold their full effect next year."
"Hence, a short and shallow recession during calendar 2024, while not our 
baseline assumption, is also possible and expected by some economists."
"Consumer spending is expected to continue as a primary growth 
driver, while government investment programs (CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act) play a supporting role for the economy as they spur 
business investment."
"GDP in China is expected to grow at only 4.6% in calendar 2024, after an anticipated growth of 5.0% in calendar 2023."
"The correction in 
the real estate sector will continue to weigh on GDP growth."
"During calendar 2024 global goods demand, world trade and industrial 
production are expected to modestly increase again."
"The main assumption behind this expectation is further normalization for two critical 
factors: consumer spending and the inventory policies of companies."
"Both weighed on industrial output in calendar 2023 but are expected 
to modestly support growth of the Chinese economy in calendar 2024."
"In addition, Chinese private consumption is expected to drive 
domestic demand and some tailwinds will come from announced stimulus measures."
"Globally, the decline of inflation rates is expected to continue, although at a slower pace."
"Past interest rate hikes are having the desired 
effect, and headline inflation is expected to steadily approach the central bank targets."
"Hence, monetary policy is expected to become less 
restrictive in calendar 2024."
"Global fixed investments should benefit from government programs and from factory investments to improve supply chain resilience and 
other diversification measures."
"Global gross fixed investments are expected to grow by 3.2% in calendar 2024, unchanged from 3.2% in 
the year before."
"The forecasts for calendars 2024 and 2023 presented here for GDP and fixed investments are based on a report from S&P Global dated 
October 15, 2023."
"8.1.2 Siemens Group 
We are basing our outlook for fiscal 2024 on the above-mentioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation 
and also on the specific market conditions we expect for our respective industrial businesses, as described in chapter 3 Segment 
information."
"Furthermore, we assume that geopolitical tensions do not further increase."
"We expect improvements in productivity and 
adjusting prices for our own products, solutions and services to more than offset effects from wage increases and higher prices for raw 
materials and components."
"We are exposed to currency translation effects, mainly involving the U.S."
"dollar, the British pound and currencies of emerging markets, 
particularly the Chinese yuan."
"Siemens is still a net exporter from the Eurozone to the rest of the world, so a weak euro is principally 
favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable."
"While we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue 
in fiscal 2024, we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the 
past."
"In addition to the natural hedging strategy, we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments."
We expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal 2024.
"In this outlook, we assume that currency 
translation effects in fiscal 2024 slightly reduce nominal volume growth rates for Siemens and profitability of our businesses."
This outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.
"Segments 
Digital Industries expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue development of 0% to 3%."
"This is based on the assumption that following 
destocking by customers, global demand in the automation businesses, especially in China, will pick up again in the second half of the 
fiscal year."
The profit margin is expected to be 20% to 23%.
Smart Infrastructure expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue growth of 7% to 10%.
The profit margin is expected to be 15% to 17%.
Mobility expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue growth of 8% to 11%.
The profit margin is expected to be 8% to 10%.
"Combined Management Report 
23 
Siemens Healthineers expects to achieve comparable revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5% in fiscal 2024, and to contribute solidly to the profit 
and profit margin of our Industrial Business."
SFS anticipates further gradually improved earnings before taxes in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.
"Return on equity (ROE) (after tax) 
is expected to be in the target range of 15% to 20%."
"Revenue growth 
For comparable revenue, we expect the Siemens Group to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8%."
"Furthermore, 
we anticipate that orders in fiscal 2024 will exceed revenue for a book-to-bill ratio above 1."
"As of September 30, 2023, our order backlog totaled €111 billion, and we expect conversion from the backlog to strongly support revenue 
growth in fiscal 2024 with approximately €43 billion of past orders converted to current revenue."
"For expected conversion of order backlog 
to revenue for our respective segments, see chapter 3 Segment information."
"Profitability 
Outside our reportable segments, we expect Portfolio Companies to achieve an operational margin of more than 5%."
Results of Siemens Energy Investment depend on the performance of Siemens Energy and are excluded from our forecast for EPS pre PPA.
We anticipate that Siemens Real Estate will continue with real estate disposals depending on market conditions.
"Results for Innovation are 
expected on the prior-year level, which was a negative €0.2 billion."
"The negative results related to Governance declined to €0.5 billion in 
fiscal 2023; we expect a further improvement in fiscal 2024."
"Centrally carried pension expense are expected to be on the prior-year level, 
which was a negative €0.1 billion."
"Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is expected in a range of €0.7 
billion to €0.8 billion in fiscal 2024 based on our current business portfolio."
"Financing, eliminations and other items, which were a negative 
€0.3 billion in fiscal 2023, are expected to be on the prior-year level depending on market developments."
We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of 24% to 29%.
"This assumption does not take into consideration possible 
impacts from potential major tax reforms."
Our forecast for net income takes into account a number of additional factors.
We assume solid project execution continues in fiscal 2024.
"We plan to keep the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, which was 8% in fiscal 2023 at approximately the level in fiscal 2024."
"We expect 
the ratio of selling and general administrative expenses to revenue, which was 18% in fiscal 2023 to remain approximately on this level in 
fiscal 2024."
"Severance charges, which were €0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, are expected at a lower level in fiscal 2024."
"Given the above-mentioned assumptions, we expect profitable growth of our Industrial Business to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA 
excluding Siemens Energy Investment to a range of €10.40 to €11.00 in fiscal 2024, along with a corresponding increase in net income."
"For comparison, fiscal 2023 EPS pre PPA was €9.93 excluding €0.84 in EPS pre PPA from Siemens Energy Investment."
"Capital efficiency 
For fiscal 2024, we expect ROCE to be in our target range of 15% to 20%."
"Capital structure 
We aim in general for a capital structure of up to 1.5; we expect to achieve this in fiscal 2024."
"Cash conversion rate 
For fiscal 2024, we expect a cash conversion rate that contributes to reaching our target of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth 
rate of Siemens over a cycle of three to five years."
"8.1.3 Overall assessment 
Our outlook for the Siemens Group for fiscal 2024 is based on the assumption that geopolitical tensions do not further increase."
"Under 
this condition, we expect our Industrial Business to continue its profitable growth."
For the Siemens Group we expect comparable revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8% and a book-to-bill ratio above 1.
"We expect profitable growth of our Industrial Business to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment to a range 
of €10.40 to €11.00 in fiscal 2024, up from EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment of €9.93 in fiscal 2023."
This outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.
"Overall, the actual development for Siemens and its segments may vary, positively or negatively, from our outlook due to the risks and 
opportunities described below or if our expectations and assumptions do not materialize."
"8.2 Risk management  
8.2.1 Basic principles of risk management 
Our risk management policy stems from a philosophy of pursuing sustainable growth and creating economic value while managing 
appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks."
"As risk management is an integral part of how we plan and execute 
our business strategies, our risk management policy is set by the Managing Board."
"Our organizational and accountability structure requires 
each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk management programs that are tailored to their specific 
industries and responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy."
"Combined Management Report 
24 
8.2.2 Enterprise risk management process 
We have implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems which support us in the early recognition of 
developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business."
"The most important of these systems include our enterprise-wide 
processes for strategic planning and management reporting."
"Strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks and 
opportunities well in advance of major business decisions, while management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks 
more closely as our business progresses."
"Our risk management and its contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our 
internal audit function."
"Accordingly, if deficits are detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate measures for their elimination."
"This 
coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed 
about significant risks in a timely manner."
"Risk management at Siemens builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities."
"The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process, our internal 
control and our compliance management system."
"They consider a company’s strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business 
operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important."
"Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially 
affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives."
"The time horizon is typically three years, and we 
take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls."
"If risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial statements (e.g."
"as a provision or risk 
contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entity’s business objectives."
"As a consequence, only 
additional risks arising from the same cause (e.g."
"deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered."
"In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining 
elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches."
"Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle; we complement this periodic 
reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner."
"Relevant risks and opportunities are 
evaluated in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and 
regulatory requirements."
"The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective 
managements of our organizational units."
"The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at 
different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant."
"Reported risks and 
opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units 
mentioned above."
"Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the 
significance of the respective risk or opportunity."
"In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing 
one of our general response strategies."
"Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction or 
acceptance of the relevant risk."
Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to “pursue” the relevant opportunity.
"In a 
second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation and monitoring of appropriate response 
measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy."
"These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective 
risk management."
"Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics."
"For example, we mitigate 
the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities."
"Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order 
to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses."
"Due to 
regular screening of climate risks and environmental, social and governance (ESG) developments we can initiate related mitigation actions 
in a timely manner – also as part of our DEGREE implementation."
"Worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents 
from animals to humans, from humans to humans and in other ways."
"Epidemic, pandemic or other infectious developments such as 
bioterrorism to cause high disease rates in countries, regions or continents."
"We constantly check information from the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S."
"and Europe, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany and 
other institutions in order to be able to identify early epidemic or pandemic risks and determine and initiate related mitigation actions as 
early as possible."
"In order to allow for a meaningful discussion at the Siemens Group level, this organization aggregates individual risks and 
opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes."
"This aggregation naturally results in a mixture 
of risks, including those with a primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative assessment; the same applies to 
opportunities."
"Accordingly, we do not adopt a purely quantitative assessment of risk and opportunity themes."
"Thematic risk and 
opportunity assessments as well as our risk-bearing capacity then form the basis for the evaluation of the company-wide risk and 
opportunity situation during the quarterly Managing Board meetings."
"The Head of Assurance assists the Managing Board with the 
operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"Combined Management Report

8.3 Risks 
Below we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition (including effects on 
assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation."
"The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four 
categories reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the 
risks’ current importance to us."
"Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our 
business objectives and operations."
"Unless otherwise stated, the risks described below relate to all our organizational units."
"8.3.1 Strategic risks 
Economic, political and geopolitical conditions: We see high uncertainties regarding the global economic and geopolitical outlook, 
which deteriorated significantly in the past year due to multiple headwinds, all of which may continue to intensify."
"First, the Israel-Gaza 
conflict continues to escalate and might cause a larger regional conflict involving further parties."
"Ongoing risks emanate from the war in 
Ukraine."
"Each of the conflicts could also intensify further to the point of expanding to 
include other warring parties, including NATO countries, and the use of unconventional weapons."
"An expansion of the conflicts would 
have a significant impact on the Siemens market environment."
"Even the current states of conflicts could have a further negative impact 
on development of potential crude oil and natural gas supplies."
"This would fuel inflation, with further risk of a sustained wage-price-spiral."
"In any case one of the core risks for the Siemens outlook is that central banks may fail to get inflation below their targets and then react 
more restrictively or even overreact."
"More restrictive financial conditions would likely push advanced economies into recession and pose 
a significant risk to vulnerable emerging economies."
"Highly indebted (emerging and industrialized) countries could suffer from increasing 
financing costs, further U.S."
"dollar appreciation, and loss of investor confidence."
"Other risks could arise for the stability of public finances 
and the banking sector."
"Further risks are coming from other geopolitical tensions (particularly associated with the Baltics, Eastern Europe, 
the Western Balkans, China, Taiwan, and Iran)."
"We continue to face economic risks from a further significant slow-down of the Chinese 
economy."
"Key risks are coming from potential financial imbalances, particularly due to the struggling real-estate sector, but also from the 
growing debt-level of local governments, with growing negative implications for Siemens business in China and the country’s trading 
partners."
Obstruction and redefinitions of international cooperation agreements could severely impact our business.
"First and foremost a 
more extensive U.S.-China decoupling would have adverse effects on confidence and investment activity and would severely hit Siemens’ 
business."
"Increasing trade barriers, protectionism, sanctions and in particular technical regulations would negatively impact production 
costs and productivity along our global value chains, as well as significantly impede or even hinder access to sales markets."
"A significant 
risk to our sales potential and cost structures is coming from the possibility of renewed supply chain bottlenecks, due to growing lack of 
availability of intermediate goods, in particular electronic components."
"Furthermore, grid-lock in U.S."
politics could weigh on U.S.
"growth 
with the risk of a global spillover."
"We are dependent on the economic development of certain industries; a continuation or even an 
intensification of the cyclical and structural headwinds in core customer industries, e.g."
"automotive or construction, would have adverse 
impact on our business prospects."
"A resurgence of COVID-19 or even the outbreak of a new pandemic, a terrorist attack, a significant 
cybercrime incident, or a series of such attacks or incidents in major economies, could depress economic activity globally and undermine 
consumer and business confidence."
"Additionally, the highly interconnected global economy remains vulnerable to natural disasters or 
hybrid warfare."
"If we are not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to subsequent changes in conditions in the markets in which we 
operate, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects."
"For example, our customers may modify, delay or cancel 
plans to purchase our products, solutions and services, or fail to follow through on purchases or contracts already executed."
"In addition, it 
may become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing."
"Contracted payment terms, especially regarding the level of advance 
payments by our customers relating to long-term projects, may become less favorable, which could negatively impact our financial 
condition."
"Siemens’ global setup with operations in almost all relevant economies, our wide range of offerings with varied exposures to 
business cycles, and our balanced mix of business models (e.g."
"equipment, components, systems, software, services and solutions) help 
us to absorb impacts from adverse developments in any single market."
"Portfolio measures, at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances: Our strategy includes divesting our activities in 
some business areas and strengthening others through portfolio measures, including mergers and acquisitions."
"With respect to 
divestments, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative 
impact on our business situation, financial condition, results of operations and reputation."
"Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky 
because of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products."
"There can be no assurance that any 
of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and in a timely manner as originally planned, or that they will perform as 
anticipated once integrated."
"In addition, we may incur significant acquisition, administrative, tax and other expenditures in connection 
with these transactions, including costs related to integration of acquired businesses."
"Furthermore, portfolio measures may result in 
additional financing needs and adversely affect our capital structure."
"Acquisitions can lead to substantial additions to intangible assets, 
including goodwill, in our statements of financial position."
"Our investment portfolio 
includes investments held for purposes other than trading and other investments."
"Any factors negatively influencing the financial 
condition and results of operations of our at-equity investments, such as Siemens Energy, and other investments could have an adverse 
effect on our equity pick-up related to these investments or may result in a related write-off."
"In addition, our business situation, financial 
condition and results of operations could also be adversely affected in connection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial 
covenants related to these investments."
"In addition, joint ventures bear the risk of difficulties 
that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products."
"Strategic alliances may also pose risks for us because we 
compete in some business areas with companies with which we have strategic alliances."
"Besides other measures, we handle these risks 
with standardized processes as well as dedicated roles and responsibilities in the areas of mergers, acquisitions, divestments and carve-
outs."
This includes the systematic treatment of all contractual obligations and post-closing claims.

Increasing sustainability focus: Governments around the world continue to increase their focus on sustainability topics, resulting in the 
risk of increased costs to comply with new laws and related reporting requirements."
"In addition, increasing stakeholder and investor focus 
on sustainability topics brings reputational risk should our sustainability commitments, targets and activities be perceived as a deceptive 
use of green marketing or otherwise not credible."
"Climate change litigation has become a worldwide phenomenon with a corresponding 
risk to Siemens as a large corporation."
"We address these risks in a variety of ways including through our sustainability framework DEGREE, 
in which we have set ambitious sustainability targets."
"DEGREE includes measures to reduce our carbon footprint along with other initiatives 
addressing ESG topics more generally."
"We have implemented an ESG due diligence process that supports Siemens businesses with due 
diligence in the customer-oriented environment with a view to possible environmental and social risks as well as related human rights and 
reputational risks."
"Finally, we believe our overall portfolio is very well positioned to meet the current and future sustainability needs of our 
customers and the societies in which we operate."
"Disruptive technologies: The markets in which our businesses operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the introduction 
of innovative and disruptive technologies."
In the field of digitalization (e.g.
"Digital Twin, artificial intelligence, cloud computing), there are 
risks associated with new competitors, substitutions for existing products/solutions/services, new business models (e.g."
"in terms of pricing, 
financing, extended scopes for project business or subscription models in the software business), and finally the risk that our competitors 
may have more advanced time-to-market strategies and introduce their disruptive products and solutions faster than Siemens."
"Siemens 
generally differentiates its software offerings from those of other software companies through deep domain know-how."
"There are risks 
associated with technologies such as artificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence, that domain expertise will not be a 
significant distinguishing feature in the future, and that additional competitors may therefore emerge more easily or rapidly."
"Our operating 
results depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets, and 
our ability to optimize our cost base accordingly."
"Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research 
and development, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may not always result in success."
"We constantly apply for new patents and actively manage our 
intellectual property portfolio to secure our technological position."
"However, our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent 
competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are similar to ours."
"Competitive environment: The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, 
product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demands."
"We face strong, established competitors as well as rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries, which may have a better 
cost structure or offer a better customer solution."
"Some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation, which may result in 
stronger competition, a change in our relative market position, an increase in inventory of finished or work-in-progress goods, or 
unexpected price erosion."
"Furthermore, there is a risk that critical suppliers could be taken over by competitors and a risk that competitors 
are increasingly offering services to our installed base."
"We address these risks with various measures, for example benchmarking, strategic 
initiatives, sales push initiatives, executing productivity measures and target cost projects, rightsizing of our footprint, outsourcings, 
mergers and joint ventures and optimizing our product and service portfolio."
"We continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market 
and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting 
to such changes."
"8.3.2 Operational risks 
Cyber/Information security: Digital technologies are deeply integrated into our business portfolio."
"The fact of a large number of suppliers requires a significant effort for the initial and regular verification of the effective implementation 
of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers."
"Siemens business entities might lose market access if their products, solutions and services do 
not comply with increased regulations and legal requirements for cybersecurity in their respective countries."
"We observe a global increase 
of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime, which pose a risk to the security of Siemens products, 
solutions and services; to Siemens IT systems and networks; and to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data."
"Like other large 
multinational companies, we face active cyber threats from sophisticated adversaries that are supported by organized crime and nation-
states engaged in economic espionage or even sabotage."
"According to external sources of relevant data, this trend has been accelerated 
by geopolitical developments and tensions worldwide."
"Especially the numbers of phishing attacks and malicious websites have increased 
significantly."
"Moreover, the information technology market 
is concentrated among a small number of information technology and software vendors, which could lead to dependence on a single 
provider."
"There can be no assurance that the measures aimed at protecting our intellectual property and portfolio will address these threats 
under all circumstances."
"Cybersecurity covers the IT of our entire enterprise including office IT, systems and applications, special-purpose 
networks, and our operating environments such as manufacturing and R&D."
"We initiated the industrial “Charter of Trust,” signed by a 
growing group of global companies, which sets out principles for building trust in digital technologies and creating a more secure digital 
world."
"Nonetheless, our systems, products, solutions and services, as well as those of our service providers, remain potentially vulnerable 
to attacks."
"Such attacks could potentially lead to the publication, manipulation or leakage of information such as through industrial 
espionage."
"They could also result in deliberate improper use of our systems, vulnerable products, production downtimes and supply 
shortages, with potential adverse effects on our reputation, our competitiveness and results of operations."
"For increased protection of 
Siemens and reduction of a potential financial impact caused by cyber incidents, the currently insurable cybersecurity risks have been to a 
partial extent transferred to a consortium of insurance companies."
"Combined Management Report 
27 
Supply chain management: The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management 
for components, sub-assemblies, energy, critical parts (e.g."
semiconductors) and materials.
"Capacity constraints and supply shortages 
resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks, delivery delays, quality issues and additional 
costs."
"We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts, components and services."
"Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and 
test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery schedules and costs."
"Although we 
work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems 
in the future, especially if we use single-source suppliers for critical components."
"Shortages and delays could materially harm our 
businesses."
"Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also 
adversely affect performance."
"Besides other measures, we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with 
various hedging instruments."
"Internal programs and initiatives: We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in cost-reduction 
initiatives, including ongoing capacity adjustment measures and structural initiatives."
"Consolidation of business activities and 
manufacturing facilities, outsourcings, joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these cost-reduction efforts."
"These measures may not be implemented as planned, may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, may become effective later than 
estimated or may not become effective at all."
"Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual 
savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them."
"In case of restructuring and outsourcing activities, there could be delays in product 
deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures."
"Furthermore, delays in critical R&D projects could lead to negative impacts in 
running projects."
"We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and 
milestone tracking approaches."
"Shortage of skilled personnel: Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel, such as specialists and experts in technical fields, 
remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate."
"We have ongoing demand for highly skilled people and a 
need to enhance diversity, inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce."
"Our future success depends in part on our continued ability 
to attract engineers, tech talent and other qualified personnel."
"We address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and 
skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries 
and markets."
"In fiscal 2023 we rolled out our new Employer Branding in all our recruiting marketing activities and started a media campaign 
with focus on tech talent in our key markets."
"Technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse 
talent."
"In addition, we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning."
"As with our existing people, we must also provide 
new talent with opportunities to grow and bond, especially soon after they join us."
"This appears especially relevant at a time of new, 
increasingly virtual working environments."
"Project-related risks: A number of our segments conduct activities under long-term contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding 
basis."
Such contracts typically arise at Mobility and in various activities of Smart Infrastructure or Portfolio Companies.
"Some of these 
contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting post-
completion warranty obligations."
"For example, we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though 
we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project."
"The profit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts 
may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over a contract’s term."
"There can be no assurance that contracts and projects, in particular those with long-term duration and fixed-price calculation, 
can be completed profitably."
"To tackle those risks, we established a global project management organization to systematically improve 
the technical and commercial capabilities of our project management personnel."
"For complex projects we conduct dedicated risk 
assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers."
"8.3.3 Financial risks 
Risks from pension obligations: The provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, 
including the discount rate, as well as by movements in financial markets or a change in the mix of assets in our investment portfolio."
"Additionally, they are subject to legal risks with regard to plan design, among other factors."
"A significant increase in underfunding may 
have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancing options and increase costs."
"In order to comply 
with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face an economic risk of increasing cash outflows due to changes in 
funding level according to local regulations of our pension plans in these countries or to changes in the regulations themselves."
"Audits by tax authorities and changes in tax regulations: We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to 
many different tax regulations."
"Changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax 
payments."
"Furthermore, legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities."
"In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights."
"As a globally operating 
organization, we conduct business in countries subject to complex tax rules, which may be interpreted in different ways."
"Future 
interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations."
"We are 
regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks."
"Market price risks: We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, especially between the U.S."
"dollar and the euro, because a high 
percentage of our business volume is conducted as exports from Europe to regions using the U.S."
"In addition, we are exposed to 
effects involving the currencies of emerging markets, in particular the Chinese yuan."
"Appreciable changes in euro exchange rates could 
materially change our competitive position."
We are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.
"Even hedging activities to mitigate such 
risks may result in a reverse effect."
"Fluctuations in exchange or interest rates, negative developments in the financial markets and changes 
Combined Management Report 
28 
in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results."
"Market prices show higher volatility than in the past due to 
increased macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from inflation, geopolitical tensions and other factors noted above."
"Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the 
financial markets might lead to adverse changes in the market values of our financial assets, in particular our derivative financial 
instruments."
"Credit risks: We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects, including guarantees."
"Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if, for example, customers do not meet obligations 
arising from these financing arrangements, meet them only partially, or meet them late."
"The credit environment has become more 
dynamic due to a more uncertain macroeconomic outlook (e.g."
inflation) and geopolitical tensions.
"For further information on post-employment benefits, derivative financial instruments, hedging activities, financial risk management and 
related measures, see Notes 17, 24 and 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023."
"8.3.4 Compliance risks 
Changes of regulations, laws and policies: Regulatory requirements are being introduced or modified at an unprecedented rate, often 
with little or no advance implementation lead time."
"This creates a risk that new requirements become effective more quickly than they 
can be implemented in the associated systems and processes, potentially resulting in business disruptions and the need for manual 
mitigation interventions."
"As a diversified company with global businesses we are exposed to various product- and country-related 
regulations, laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes."
"According to observations and analysis, there is an 
increasing risk that existing technical regulations in target markets will suddenly change, or new ones will be set in force, which result in 
market access criteria that our products do not meet."
The affected products would lose marketability in this market.
"Reducing the risk of a 
sales-stop depends on the required correction for the non-conformity."
"In case the product can technically stay as is, while it has to undergo 
new and additional conformity assessment and certification, there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and 
certification procedures."
"In a worse case, the affected product will need re-engineering or re-design to meet the requirements of the 
changed or new technical regulation even before it can become re-assessed and certified for market approval."
"The latter case will cause 
significant extra effort and cost to make the needed product changes and to maintain the country-specific product variant as an additional 
derivative item in the portfolio."
"In the worst case, if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the product’s marketability prove to be 
not feasible, we must stop selling the affected product in the market."
"The uncertain geopolitical situation has triggered unpredictable – 
and often conflicting – extraterritorial regulations, restrictions and sanctions, thus creating a potential risk that it will be difficult to 
simultaneously comply with all relevant regulatory requirements of certain transactions."
"We monitor the 
political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas, with the aim of quickly adjusting our 
business activities and processes to changed conditions."
"However, any changes in regulations, laws and policies could adversely affect our 
business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations."
"Accordingly, we may, among other things, be required to comply with potential obligations and 
liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings, including potential tax penalties."
"Moreover, any findings related 
to public corruption that are not covered by the 2008 and 2009 corruption charge settlements, which we concluded with U.S."
"and German 
authorities, may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations."
"Monitors 
could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices 
and our compliance program."
"In its global business, Siemens does part of its business with state-owned enterprises and governments."
"We also participate in projects 
funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations, such as multilateral development banks."
"Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair 
relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts."
"Moreover, third parties, 
including our competitors, could initiate significant litigation."
"In addition, future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations, such as responding to the requests of governmental 
authorities and cooperating with them, could divert management’s attention and resources from other issues facing our business."
"Furthermore, we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of 
integration."
"Along with other measures, Siemens has established a global compliance organization that conducts compliance risk mitigation processes 
such as Compliance Risk Assessments, among others, or initiates audit activities performed by the internal assurance department."
"New or expanded sanctions in countries in which 
we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries."
"We are also aware of 
policies of national authorities and institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, requiring divestment of interests 
in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the U.S."
"Department of State as 
Combined Management Report 
29 
state sponsors of terrorism."
"As a result, it is possible that such policies may result in our inability to gain or retain certain investors or 
customers."
"In addition, the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions."
"Our 
reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries or due to unauthorized diversion 
of our products to restricted parties or destinations."
"Siemens addresses these risks by maintaining a comprehensive and robust control 
program."
"In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce 
our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to adjusting our compliance programs."
"Environmental, health & safety and other governmental regulations: Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated."
"Current and future environmental, health, safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the 
way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs."
"Any such violations 
particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties, fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our 
business operations."
"In particular, we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities 
we design or operate."
"With regard to certain environmental risks, we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes 
are appropriate and consistent with industry practice."
"We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of 
such insurance, and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition and results of operations."
"Current or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings: Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes 
and proceedings in various jurisdictions."
"These legal disputes and proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to 
payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit."
"In individual cases this may 
also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits."
"Asserted claims are generally 
subject to interest rates."
"Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain 
legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice."
"However, the insurance policy does 
not protect Siemens against, in particular, reputational damage."
"Moreover, Siemens may incur losses relating to legal disputes and 
proceedings beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal 
disputes and proceedings."
"Finally, there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on 
commercially reasonable terms in the future."
"For additional information with respect to specific proceedings, see Note 22 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023."
"8.3.5 Assessment of the overall risk situation 
The most significant challenges have been mentioned first in each of the four risk categories: strategic, operational, financial and 
compliance."
"We currently see the strategic risk economic, political and geopolitical conditions 
as the most significant challenge for us followed by the operational risk cyber/information security."
"At present, no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going 
concern."
"8.4 Opportunities 
Within our ERM we regularly identify, evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity."
"Below 
we describe our most significant opportunities."
"Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units."
"The 
order in which the opportunities are presented reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these 
opportunities and thus provides an indication of the opportunities’ current importance to us."
"The described opportunities are not 
necessarily the only ones we encounter."
"In addition, our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our 
markets and technologies are constantly advancing."
It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.
"Favorable political and regulatory environment including sustainability: A favorable political and regulatory environment including 
the transition towards a low-carbon economy could restore a more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of 
our markets."
"In addition, government initiatives and subsidies (including tax reforms, green and digital recovery plans, R&D among others) 
lead to more government spending (e.g."
"infrastructure, healthcare, mobility or digitalization investments) and may ultimately result in an 
opportunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit."
"Investments to strengthen countries’ resilience, energy and 
food security, as well as to diversify value chains close to major markets (reshoring, nearshoring) can present opportunities to businesses."
"By enabling our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using our portfolio and by reducing CO2 emission in our own 
operations, Siemens strives to support the transition towards a low-carbon economy."
"Siemens also welcomes and supports recent 
Combined Management Report 
30 
legislative and governmental measures to accelerate the mitigation of climate change, especially in Europe such as through the Green 
Deal or sustainable finance initiatives."
"Value creation through innovation: We drive innovation by investing significantly in R&D in order to develop sustainable solutions for 
our customers while also strengthening our own competitiveness."
"Being an innovative company and constantly inventing new 
technologies that we expect will meet future demands arising from the megatrends of demographic change, urbanization, digitalization, 
environmental change, resource scarcity and glocalization is one of our core purposes."
"We are granted thousands of new patents every 
year and continuously develop new concepts and convincing new digital and data-driven business models."
"This helps us create the next 
generation of ground-breaking innovations in such fields as digital twin, artificial intelligence, automation and edge computing."
"Across 
our operating units, we are profiting from our strength in connecting the real and digital worlds."
"Our Xcelerator platform is an open, digital 
business platform featuring a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware and software, an ecosystem and a marketplace to enhance the 
digital transformation of our customers."
"We see growth opportunities in opening up access to new markets and customers through new 
marketing and sales strategies, which we implement in our operating units."
"Our position along the value chains of automation and 
digitalization allows us to further increase market penetration."
"Along these value chains, we have identified several clear growth fields in 
which we see our greatest long-term potential."
"Hence, we are combining and developing our resources and capabilities for these growth 
fields."
"Leveraging Market Potential: Through sales and services initiatives we continuously strive to grow and extend our businesses in 
established markets, open up new markets for existing portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in order to gain a higher 
market share and increased profits."
"Furthermore, we aim to increase our sales via improved account management and new distribution 
channels."
"Optimization of organization and processes: On the one hand, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and 
cost structure, such as common computing architecture for image processing."
"Furthermore, we leverage ideas to drive further 
improvements in our processes and cost structure optimizing factory capacities for shorter lead times."
"On the other hand, we see an 
opportunity of further penetrating markets by quality initiative program and avoiding or reducing non conformance cost."
"Mergers, acquisitions, equity investments, partnerships, divestments and streamlining our portfolio: We constantly monitor our 
current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers, acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships, which 
may complement our organic growth."
"Such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets, provide access to 
new or underserved markets, or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas."
"Opportunities might also arise when portfolio 
optimization measures generate gains, which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability."
"Assessment of the overall opportunities situation: The most significant opportunity for Siemens is favorable political and regulatory 
environment (including sustainability) as described above."
"Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities 
relating to the achievement of business goals, the correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting, and compliance with the 
laws and regulations relevant to Siemens."
"Sustainability aspects are covered as well and are continuously developed based on the 
regulatory requirements."
"Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally accepted COSO framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission)."
"Our ERM approach is based on the COSO Standard “Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and 
Performance” (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens 
requirements."
"Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” (2013) also developed by 
COSO."
"The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
ICS."
"The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS, both systems are complementary."
All Siemens entities are part of our ICS and ERM.
"The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different, depending, among 
others, on the entity’s impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens and the specific risks associated with the entity."
"The 
management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility, based on 
the group-wide mandatory methodology."
Overall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board.
"The Siemens Risk and Internal Control (RIC) organization bundles 
and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and 
effective processes for implementing, monitoring and reporting on internal control and ERM activities."
"It consists of the central RIC 
departments of Siemens AG and the RIC departments at our organizational units."
"The central RIC departments are responsible for 
monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group."
"We have an overarching, integrated ICS and ERM methodology (RIC methodology) with a standardized procedure under which necessary 
controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness."
"For 
more information on ERM, see chapter 8.2 Risk management."
Our ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function.
"These are carried 
out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request."
"Siemens Healthineers 
has its own internal audit function and annual audit plan."
"Topics from the annual audit plan of Siemens Healthineers that are also relevant 
for our Managing Board and Audit Committee must be mandated first by Siemens Healthineers’ Managing Board and Audit Committee 
Combined Management Report 
31 
and subsequently by our Managing Board and Audit Committee."
"The audit procedures for these topics will be – where reasonable – 
executed by joint teams including members of our and Siemens Healthineers’ internal audit functions, thus respecting the interests of 
both Siemens AG and Siemens Healthineers."
"At the end of each fiscal year, our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM."
"This 
evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens “In Control”-Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings."
"The information contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board of Siemens AG to report on the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM."
"The Siemens “In Control”-Statement is supported by 
certifications at various corporate levels and by all affiliated companies."
"In the quarterly Managing Board meetings, the company-wide risk 
and opportunity situation is evaluated, the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion is 
made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS or ERM."
"Based on this, the Managing Board has no indication that our ICS or ERM 
in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30, 2023."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system."
"For example, no system – 
even if deemed to be adequate and effective – can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any 
process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances."
The Audit Committee is systematically integrated into our ICS and ERM.
"In particular, it oversees the accounting and the accounting process 
as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS, ERM and the internal audit system."
Siemens Healthineers is largely subject to the Group-wide principles for our ICS and ERM and is responsible for adhering to those principles.
"The integration of Varian into our ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2023 
and was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities."
"The integration measures are planned to be completely finalized 
in fiscal 2024."
"8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS) 
Our ICS and ERM also comprise a CMS aligned to the Company's risk situation which is based on the three pillars – prevent, detect and 
react."
"In addition, there are extensive internal compliance regulations, including associated controls, which oblige all Siemens 
employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS."
"They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas 
with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information."
"The compliance operating model contains 
binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works."
"Compliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and thus enable 
to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks."
"The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business 
processes and tools."
The results of CMS that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the Company-wide ERM.
The Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance with and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide.
"It is part 
of the ICS and is continuously further developed and adapted to the current Siemens guidelines."
"In addition, current compliance issues are 
discussed at the management level on a regular basis."
The entire CMS is continuously adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements.
"The findings from compliance risk 
management as well as compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for its further development."
"Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally recognized COSO framework, for further information see 8.5.1."
"At the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS."
"We have a 
standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested 
regularly for their effectiveness."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system, and no system, 
including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements."
"Our Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS are prepared on the basis of a centrally issued conceptual framework which 
primarily consists of uniform Financial Reporting Guidelines and a chart of accounts."
"For Siemens AG and other companies within the 
Siemens Group required to prepare financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Code, this conceptual framework is 
complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code."
"The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework 
due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis."
"Accounting departments are informed quarterly about current topics and 
deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective."
"The base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the closing data reported by the operations of Siemens AG and its 
subsidiaries."
The preparation of the closing data of most of our entities is supported by an internal shared services organization.
"Furthermore, other accounting activities, such as governance and monitoring activities, are usually bundled on a regional level."
"In 
particular cases, such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits, we use external experts."
"The reported closing data is used to 
prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system."
"The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both 
manual and automated controls."
"Combined Management Report

Qualification of employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and training."
"As a 
fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the “four eyes” principle applies, and specific procedures must be adhered to 
for data authorization."
"Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and 
changes in individual line items, both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"In 
line with our information security requirements, accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting them from 
unauthorized access."
"The manual and system-based control mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) closing data to the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG."
"On a quarterly basis, we execute an internal certification process."
"Siemens Healthineers is subject to our Group-wide principles for the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and 
is responsible for adhering to those principles."
"The integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, 
continued in fiscal 2023 and was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities."
"The integration measures are planned 
to be completely finalized in fiscal 2024."
"Our internal audit function systematically reviews our financial reporting integrity, our accounting-related ICS and ERM."
"Siemens 
Healthineers has its own internal audit department and annual audit plan (see also 8.5.1)."
"The Audit Committee is integrated into our 
accounting-related ICS."
"In particular, it oversees the accounting and accounting process and the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
associated ICS, the ERM and the internal audit system."
"Moreover, we have rules for accounting-related complaints."

"Siemens AG 
The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth in the German 
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz)."
"In fiscal 2023, results for Siemens AG arise mainly from the business activities of Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure and are 
influenced significantly by the results of subsidiaries and investments Siemens AG owns either directly or indirectly."
"The business 
development of Siemens AG is fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as the Siemens Group."
"Therefore, the foregoing 
explanations for the Siemens Group apply also for Siemens AG."
"The Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose to distribute a dividend of €4.70 per share of no par value entitled to the dividend, 
from the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 amounting to €3.8 billion."
"The proposed 
dividend represents a total payout of €3.7 billion based on the estimated number of shares entitled to dividend at the date of the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting."
We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders.
"This includes striving for a dividend per 
share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or at least matches it."
"For fiscal 2024, we expect that net income of Siemens AG 
will be sufficient to fund the distribution of a commensurate dividend."
"As of September 30, 2023, the number of employees was around 47.300."
Exports from Germany accounted for 57% of overall revenue.
"In fiscal 2023, orders for Siemens AG 
amounted to €16.1 billion."
"The increases in revenue, cost of sales and research and development expenses were most evident at Digital Industries."
"The R&D intensity (R&D costs as a percentage of revenue) was 10.6%, slightly above the level in fiscal 2022."
"The R&D activities of Siemens 
AG are fundamentally the same as for its corresponding business activities within the Siemens Group."
"R&D expenses in both periods related 
mainly to Digital Industries."
"On an average basis, Siemens AG employed 7,100 people in R&D in fiscal 2023."
The increase in selling and general administrative expenses was due mainly to higher selling expenses led by Digital Industries.
"Other operating income (expenses), net, included mainly a loss of €0.2 billion from a disposal in connection with the carve-out of 
business activities into the Innomotics GmbH, partly offset by €0.1 billion income from an intragroup service contract."
"Fiscal 2022 included 
mainly expenses of €0.2 billion from the intragroup service contract and expenses of €0.1 billion for the recognition of a provision related 
to guarantees and expected obligations from consortium contracts."
"Income (loss) from investments, net included mainly income from investments of €2.9 billion (fiscal 2022: €4.8 billion) and income 
from profit transfer agreements with affiliated companies of €1.6 billion (fiscal 2022: €3.5 billion)."
"Additionally, in fiscal 2023 Siemens 
AG recorded a gain of €0.2 billion from the sale of a part of its stake in Siemens Energy AG and a gain of €0.2 billion from the reversal of 
an impairment on the remaining stake in Siemens Energy AG."
"The remaining stake held directly by Siemens AG amounted to 21.0% as of 
September 30, 2023."
These gains were partly offset by a loss of €0.2 billion from an impairment on a stake in Thoughtworks Holding Inc.
"For comparison, in fiscal 2022 Siemens AG recorded losses of €4.0 billion from impairment of investments, which included an impairment 
of €2.9 billion on Siemens AG’s stake in Siemens Energy AG, Germany."
"Interest and other financial income (expenses), net included a negative interest result of €0.6 billion compared to a positive interest 
result of €0.4 billion a year earlier, which was driven by the effect of higher interest rates on intragroup-financing activities."

"The liquidity management is based on the financing policy of the Siemens 
Group, which is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion."
"The increase in equity was due to net income for the year of €4.5 billion and the transfer of €0.6 billion in treasury shares to employees 
in connection with our share-based payment programs."
"These factors were partly offset by dividends paid in fiscal 2023 (for fiscal 2022) 
of €3.4 billion and share buybacks during the year amounting to €0.9 billion."

any rights."
Under Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law.
"Siemens shares issued to employees worldwide under the Siemens share programs implemented since the beginning of fiscal 2009, in 
particular the Share Matching Plan, are freely transferable unless applicable local laws indicate otherwise."
"The right to receive matching shares is forfeited if the purchased shares are sold, 
transferred, hedged on, pledged or hypothecated in any way during the relevant vesting period."
"The von Siemens-Vermögensverwaltung GmbH (vSV) has, on a sustained basis, powers of attorney allowing it to exercise the voting rights 
for 10,059,581 Siemens shares (as of September 30, 2023) on behalf of members of the Siemens family."
"These shares are part of the total 
number of shares held by the family’s members."
"The powers of attorney are based on an agreement between the vSV and, among others, 
members of the Siemens family."

2024 by up to €510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million Siemens shares against contributions in cash and/or in kind 
(Authorized Capital 2019)."
"As of September 30, 2023, the total unissued authorized capital of Siemens AG therefore consisted of €600 million nominal that may be 
used, in installments with varying terms, by issuing up to 200 million Siemens shares."
"Based on these two authorizations, the Company or its 
affiliated companies may issue such convertible bonds and/or warrant bonds until January 29, 2024 and February 4, 2025, respectively,

"10.5 Significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of  
the Company following a takeover bid 
As of September 30, 2023, Siemens AG maintained lines of credit in the amount of €7.45 billion."
"In January 2023, Siemens AG entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of US$250 million and in December 2022, Siemens 
AG entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of PLN500 million; both loan agreements have been fully drawn."
"In December 2021, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the 
amount of €500 million, which has been fully drawn."
"In addition, in March 2020 and in June 2019 respectively, a consolidated subsidiary 
as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement, each of which has been drawn in the full amount of 
US$500 million."
"3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 
139/2004)."
Framework agreements concluded by Siemens AG under International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
"Partially this right of termination exists only, if (1) the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume Siemens 
AG’s obligations under the ISDA Agreements or (2) the resulting entity’s creditworthiness is materially weaker than Siemens AG’s 
immediately prior to such event."
"Generally, ISDA Agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims 
documented under them are to be netted."
"If this right of termination is exercised, the Managing Board member is entitled to a severance 
payment in the amount of no more than two years’ compensation."
"The calculation of the annual compensation includes not only the base 
compensation and the target amount for the bonus, but also the target amount for the stock awards, in each case based on the most 
recent completed fiscal year prior to termination of the contract."
"The stock-based compensation components for which a firm commitment 
already exists will remain unaffected."
"Additionally, the severance payments cover non-monetary benefits by including an amount of 5% 
of the total severance amount."
"Severance payments will be reduced by 10% as a lump-sum allowance for discounted values and for income 
earned elsewhere."
"However, this reduction will apply only to the portion of the severance payment that was calculated without taking 
account of the first six months of the remaining term of the Managing Board member’s contract."
"There is no entitlement to a severance 
payment if the Managing Board member receives benefits from third parties in connection with a change of control."
"A right to terminate 
the contract does not exist if the change of control occurs within a period of twelve months prior to a Managing Board member’s 
retirement."
"On September 18, 2019, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG resolved that the contracts with members of the Managing Board should 
not contain such right of termination in the future."
"This has already been taken into account in the case of contract extensions and in the 
case of new contracts with the newly appointed members of the Managing Board as of October 1, 2020."
"10.7 Other takeover-relevant information 
We are not aware of, nor have we during the last fiscal year been notified of, any shareholder directly or indirectly holding 10% or more 
of the voting rights."
There are no Siemens shares with special rights conferring powers of control.
"Shares of stock issued by Siemens AG 
to employees under its share programs and/or as share-based compensation are transferred to the employees."
"The beneficiary employees 
who hold shares of employee stock may exercise their control rights in the same way as any other shareholder in accordance with 
applicable laws and the Articles of Association."
"Combined Management Report

"EU Taxonomy disclosure 
The key performance indicators (KPI) in this section were determined based on Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 in 
conjunction with the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable for the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"For the calculation of CapEx and OpEx, allocations were also made based on the revenue of the 
Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities."
"To avoid double counting, a mapping was always made to one economic activity only."
"Following 
the eligibility assessment, the alignment with Substantial Contribution criteria for all eligible business activities was assessed and 
documented based on appropriate reporting hierarchy levels, such as business-segment, product-family or project level."
"Once a business 
activity demonstrated Substantial Contribution, the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria were assessed together with technical experts 
on the product, site, project and/or supplier level."
"For fiscal 2023, EU Taxonomy reporting is limited to the first two environmental 
objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaption)."
"Based on its implemented group-wide structures on risk analysis, 
corporate guidelines and due diligence processes and mechanisms, Siemens fulfills the Minimum Safeguards requirements, which 
comprise the areas of human rights, anti-corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition."
"Revenue KPI 
The revenue KPI shows the ratio of revenue from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to the total revenue in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income for the reporting year."
"Based on an assessment of the Siemens business portfolio, Taxonomy-eligible 
revenue accounted for 20.3% and Taxonomy-aligned revenue for 16.5% of total revenue."
"This translates into €15.7 billion in Taxonomy-
eligible revenue and €12.8 billion in aligned revenue."
"The difference between Taxonomy-eligible revenue and Taxonomy-aligned revenue is mainly due to DNSH criteria related to pollution 
prevention as part of Appendix C, which go beyond existing national regulation."
"This is mainly because additionally required 
documentation is not completely available yet."
"In the reporting year, 34.5% (€1.3 billion) of Siemens’ CapEx were eligible, and 12.2% (€0.5 
billion) were aligned."
"The aligned CapEx is composed as follows: a majority of €0.4 billion is related to additions to property, plant and 
equipment, the remainder pertains to internally generated intangible assets and capitalized right-of-use assets."
"This aligned CapEx includes €116 million related to a CapEx plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal 2028, summing 
up to a planned total volume of €1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs)."
"The buildings are designed to minimize energy use 
and carbon emissions (CCM 7.7)."
"Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) related to Siemens’ real estate portfolio represents the largest portion in overall CapEx 
eligibility."
"Operating expenditures KPI 
The OpEx KPI shows the ratio of OpEx from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to total OpEx."
"Accordingly, 12.4% (€0.9 billion) of Siemens’ OpEx were eligible and 8.2% (€0.6 
billion) were aligned."
"The majority of eligible and/or aligned expenditures relate to processes and assets associated with the economic activities described for 
the revenue KPI: (i) Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport (CCM 3.3) and (ii) rail transportation infrastructure (CCM 6.14)."
These two activities account for half of eligible OpEx and the majority of aligned OpEx.
"This aligned OpEx includes €3 million related to a CapEx plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal 2028, summing up 
to a planned total volume of €1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs)."
"The buildings are designed to minimize energy use 
and carbon emissions (CCM 7.7)."
"Corresponding to revenue, the difference between Taxonomy-eligible OpEx and Taxonomy-aligned OpEx relates mainly to the 
documentation of DNSH criteria for pollution prevention (Appendix C)."

1."
"They have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union as well 
as with the additional requirements set forth in Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"The Consolidated Financial 
Statements are in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)."
"The Consolidated Financial 
Statements were authorized for issue by the Managing Board on December 4, 2023."
"Siemens prepares and reports its Consolidated 
Financial Statements in euros (€)."
"Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided."
"Siemens is a German 
based multinational focused technology company."
"Such critical accounting 
estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial positions and 
cash flows."
"Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in 
the current accounting period."
"Siemens cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require 
adjustment."
"Siemens operates in an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, particularly due to the war in 
Ukraine and the conflict in Israel-Gaza/Middle East."
"Notably, we face continuing inflation, increased interest rates, volatile foreign 
currencies and share prices along with a rising apprehension of a slow-down of economic growth in significant markets compared to prior 
years."
"Uncertainties increase in prognosis and forecasts, in applying critical accounting estimates and in using management judgements."
"Those trends could impact fair values and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash 
flows of Siemens."
"Severity and duration of those trends are decisive on the magnitude of its impact on Siemens’ Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
Siemens based its estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available.
"Basis of consolidation – The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries over which the 
Company has control."
Siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee.
"In addition, Siemens is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from the involvement with the investee and Siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of 
Siemens’ return."
"Business combinations – Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the 
date of exchange."
"Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are 
initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest."
"Non-controlling 
interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method)."
"If there is no loss 
of control, transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income."
"At the date control 
is lost, any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value."
"In case of a written put option on non-controlling interests the Company 
assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date."
"If the Company is 
not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet 
date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price."
The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.
"Associates and joint ventures – Associates are companies over which Siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over 
operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights)."
"Joint ventures are 
entities over which Siemens and one or more parties have joint control."
"Joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing 
control in decision making on relevant activities."
"Associates and joint ventures are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recognized 
at cost."
"If the investment was retained in a transaction in which Siemens lost control of a subsidiary, the fair value of the investment 
represents the cost on initial recognition."
"The cumulative post-acquisition changes also include effects 
from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment."
"When Siemens’ share of losses in an associate 
or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment, Siemens does not recognize further losses, unless it incurs obligations or 
makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture."
"The interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the 
investment together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of Siemens’ net investment in the associate or joint venture."
"Siemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired, for 
example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost."
"In addition, Siemens similarly assesses 
whether there are indications that an impairment loss recorded in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased."
"If this is the 
case, any reversal of an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount subsequently increases, not exceeding 
the carrying amount, had no impairment loss been recognized in previous periods."
"Impairments and reversal of impairments include the 
use of judgements."
"Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified 
to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized."
"The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are 
translated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the 
end of the reporting period."
"At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to functional currency 
applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date."
"Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized 
in net income."
"Those foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasured using the historical 
spot exchange rate."
"Revenue recognition – Siemens recognizes revenue when, or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e."
Revenue is the transaction price Siemens expects to be entitled to.
"Variable consideration is 
included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties 
are resolved."
"The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending 
on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration."
"Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the 
period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing 
benefit either to the customer or Siemens."
"If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated 
to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices."
"If stand-alone selling prices are not observable, the Company 
reasonably estimates those."
Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.
"Revenues from construction-type contracts: Revenues are recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on 
the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs."
"An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense 
immediately."
Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.
"The percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards 
completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations."
"These 
significant estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical, political and regulatory 
risks, risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments."
"Under the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may 
lead to an increase or decrease of revenue."
"In addition, Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether 
it is terminated."
"In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario, all relevant 
facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis."
"Revenues from maintenance and service contracts: Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance 
pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e."
under the percentage-of-completion method as described above.
"Payment 
terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms."
"Revenues from product sales: Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon 
delivery of the goods."
Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within 30 days.
"Revenues from software contracts: Software contracts usually comprise the sale of subscription licenses and perpetual licenses, which 
are both on-premise, as well as technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades and the sale of software-as-a-
service."
"Subscription contracts generally contain two separate performance obligations: time-based software license and technical support 
service."
"Revenues for perpetual and time-based licenses granting the customer a right to use Siemens’ intellectual property are recognized 
at a point in time, i.e."
when control of the license passes to the customer.
"Revenues for technical support services including updates and 
unspecified upgrades are recognized over time on a straight-line basis as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits 
provided by Siemens’ services."
"Software-as-a-service contracts including related cloud services represent one performance obligation for 
which revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis."
"Payment terms for all transactions are usually 30 days from the date of 
invoice issued according to the contractual terms."
Income from interest – Interest is recognized using the effective interest method.
"Functional costs – In general, operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions following the functional area of the 
corresponding profit and cost centers."
"Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets."
"Product-related expenses – Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item Cost of sales at the time 
the related sale is recognized."
Research and development costs – Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred.
"Costs of development activities are capitalized 
when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met."
"Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and 
impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to 25 years."
"Earnings per share – Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued 
operations and net income, all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
during the year."
"Diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and share-
based payment plans."
"Goodwill – Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes 
in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable."
"Goodwill is carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses."
"The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-
generating units, generally represented by a segment."
Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment.
"This is the lowest level 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes."
"For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) 
that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination."
"If the carrying amount of the (group of) cash-generating 
unit(s), to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to that (group of) 
cash-generating unit(s) is recognized."
"The recoverable amount is the higher of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s)’ fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use."
"If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values."
"These 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
9 
values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations."
"Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future 
periods."
"The determination of the recoverable amount of a (group of) cash-generating unit(s) to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of 
estimates by management."
The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g.
"by the successful integration of acquired entities, 
volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends."
"In 
determining recoverable amounts, discounted cash flow calculations generally use five-year projections (in exceptional cases up to ten 
years) that are based on financial forecasts."
"Cash flow projections consider past experience and represent management’s best estimate 
about future developments."
Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates.
"Key assumptions on 
which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted 
average cost of capital."
"These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and 
ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment."
"Other intangible assets – The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their respective 
estimated useful lives."
"Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except 
for intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired in business combinations."
"Intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology."
"Useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from two to 
30 years for customer relationships and trademarks and for technology from five to 22 years."
"Property, plant and equipment – Property, plant and equipment, is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses."
Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method.
"In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test."
"Impairment testing of 
property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets’ recoverable amount, 
which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment."
"Leases – A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration."
"Further information on leases can be found in Notes 8, 13 and 16."
"Lessor: Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred."
"If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is an 
operating lease."
Receivables from finance leases are recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
"The assets 
underlying the operating leases are presented in Property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful 
lives or to their estimated residual value."
Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
"Lessee: Siemens recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying 
asset is not of low value."
Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term.
"Extension options are included 
in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain."
"Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation expense 
and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements."
"Right-of-use assets are depreciated under the straight-line method over the 
shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets."
"Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease 
payments due over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate."
"Lease liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortized cost using the effective interest method."
They are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.
"A non-current asset or a disposal group is held for 
disposal, if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than 
through continuing use."
Depreciation and amortization cease for assets classified as held for disposal.
"In the Consolidated Statements of 
Income and of Cash Flows, discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations; prior periods are presented on a 
comparable basis."
"The disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outside of Note 3 relate to continuing operations 
or assets and liabilities not held for disposal."
"The non-current asset held for disposal or the disposal group is measured at the lower of its 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell."
"The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and 
assumptions that tend to be uncertain."
"Income taxes – Tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws, relevant court decisions and applicable 
tax authorities’ views."
"Tax regulations can be complex and possibly subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax 
authorities."
"Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in 
additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on management’s considerations."
"Under the liability method, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the 
financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases."
"Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient 
future taxable profit is available, including income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporary 
differences and available tax planning opportunities that Siemens would execute."
"As of each period-end, Siemens evaluates the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits."
"As future developments 
are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens’s control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in 
which deferred tax assets will recover."
Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.
"Consolidated Financial Statements 
10 
Expected tax effects, arising from prospectively applying the global minimum taxation rules (Pillar Two), are not considered in calculating 
deferred tax assets and liabilities."
"Currently, it is expected to apply Pillar Two to the entire Siemens Group commencing with fiscal 2025."
"Contract assets, contract liabilities, receivables – When either party to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens presents a 
contract asset, a contract liability or a receivable depending on the relationship between Siemens’ performance and the customer’s 
payment."
Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle.
"Receivables are recognized 
when the right to consideration becomes unconditional."
"Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables 
in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost."
"Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value, costs being generally 
determined based on an average or first-in, first-out method."
"Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates 
for quantity, technical and price risks."
Defined benefit plans – Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method.
"The approach reflects an 
actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered."
"In determining the net present 
value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected rates of salary and 
pension increases are considered."
"The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year 
are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year."
"Significant plans apply 
individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense."
"The net interest income or expense for 
the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the 
preceding fiscal year’s period-end date."
"Service cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated 
to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs."
"Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized 
immediately in profit or loss."
"For unfunded plans, the amount in line item Provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the DBO."
"For funded plans, Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets from the DBO."
"Siemens recognizes the net amount, after adjustments 
for effects relating to any asset ceiling."
"Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included 
in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)."
"They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes."
"Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression and 
mortality rates."
"Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and 
currency at the end of the reporting period."
"In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bonds yields."
"Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments."
"Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying 
assets at period-end."
"If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting 
forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value."
"If the effect is material, provisions are recognized 
at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money."
"When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision."
"Significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts, warranty costs, asset retirement 
obligations, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (Legal Proceedings)."
"Siemens records a provision for 
onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue."
Legal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties.
Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process.
"Due to new developments, it may be 
necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision."
"Upon 
resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters."
"The outcome of Legal 
Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens’ financial position, its results of operations and/or its cash flows."
"Termination benefits – Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity’s offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy 
before the regular retirement date or from an entity’s decision to terminate the employment."
"Termination benefits in accordance with IAS 
19, Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits."
"Financial instruments – A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity."
"Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at 
the trade date."
"Initially, financial instruments are recognized at fair value and net of transaction costs, if not categorized at FVTPL."
"Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option 
is elected."
"b) Financial assets designated as measured at FVTPL are irrevocably designated at initial recognition if the designation 
significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains (losses) were 
measured on different bases."
"Consolidated Financial Statements 
11 
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): are equity instruments for which Siemens 
irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument."
"Unrealized gains and losses, net 
of deferred income tax expenses, as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other 
comprehensive income, net of income taxes."
"Valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses, representing a forward-looking estimate of future credit losses involving 
significant judgment."
"Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor 
reflecting the loss in the event of default."
"Valuation allowances are not recognized as far as the gross carrying amount is sufficiently 
collateralized."
Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades.
"A simplified approach is used to assess expected 
credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses."
"The valuation 
allowance for loans and other long-term debt instruments primarily held at Financial Services (SFS) is measured according to a three-stage 
impairment approach:  
Stage 1: At inception, twelve-month expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default."
"Stage 2: If the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly without being credit-impaired, lifetime expected credit losses are 
recognized based on a lifetime probability of default."
"A significant increase in credit risk is determined for each individual financial 
instrument using internal credit ratings."
"A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage 2, if the credit rating remains within 
the investment grade range."
"More than 30 days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage 2, if the delay is not credit-risk-
related."
"Stage 3: If the financial asset is credit-impaired, valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses."
"A financial asset is considered 
credit-impaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default, however, 
the definition of default is not yet met."
"Impairment triggers include liquidity problems, a request for debt restructuring or a breach of 
contract."
A credit-risk driven contractual modification always results in a credit-impaired financial asset.
Financial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely.
"Generally, if the limitation period expired, when a debtor’s 
sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value."
"Receivables are written off when 
bankruptcy proceedings close."
A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party.
"Significant 
modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new 
financial asset; for insignificant modifications, the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition."
"Cash and cash equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of 
acquisition to be cash equivalents."
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.
"Loan Commitments – Expected credit losses for irrevocable loan commitments are determined using the three-stage impairment 
approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability."
"Financial liabilities – except for derivative financial instruments, Siemens measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method."
"Derivative financial instruments – Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap 
contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied."
"Changes 
in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, in line item 
Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax)."
"Certain derivative instruments embedded in host 
contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives."
Fair value hedges: The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
"Where an 
unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a 
separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income."
"For hedged items carried at amortized cost, 
the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item."
"For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or 
liabilities that result from meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were 
previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities."
"Cash flow hedges: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are 
recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net 
income."
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.
Share-based payment – Share-based payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equity-settled.
"Fair value is measured 
at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period."
"Fair value is determined as the price of the underlying shares, considering dividends 
during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable."
"Plans 
granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and, accordingly, are accounted as equity-settled."
"Insurance contracts – In June 2020, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (IFRS 17), effective for reporting periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2023."
Siemens will adopt the standard commencing with fiscal 2024.
"IFRS 17 introduces and applies uniform accounting 
policies for insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance contracts."
"The adoption of IFRS 17 is not expected to have a significant 
impact on Siemens’ Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Prior-year information – The presentation of certain prior-year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year 
presentation."
"Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 3 Acquisitions and dispositions 
Acquisitions  
In fiscal 2023, Siemens completed several individually minor acquisitions for a total purchase price of €373 million, mainly paid in cash."
"In 
fiscal 2022 acquisitions totaled €2.0 billion."
"In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the (preliminary) purchase price allocations resulted in Other 
intangible assets of €180 million and €1.1 billion, respectively, and in Goodwill of €203 million and €1.5 billion, respectively."
"Goodwill 
comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects."
"The purchase price 
allocation for some of the acquired businesses is preliminary, as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized."
"Disposals 
In November 2022, Siemens sold its Commercial Vehicles business for a consideration of €184 million in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain 
on the disposal of €148 million, which is presented in Other operating income."
"The business was previously reported at Portfolio 
Companies."
"The fair value of our investment in Siemens Energy AG is €2.5 billion and €2.9 billion, respectively, as of 
September 30, 2023 and 2022, determined based on Siemens Energy’s market capitalization (level 1 of the fair value hierarchy)."
"In fiscal 
2023 and 2022, Siemens Energy AG added a loss to Share of profit (loss), net of €(1,478) million and €(207) million, respectively."
"The loss 
includes Siemens’ share of Siemens Energy AG’s net losses of €(1,405) million and €(142) million as well as effects from fair value 
adjustments at initial recognition of €(73) million and €(65) million, respectively."
"In fiscal 2023, Siemens Energy AG acquired and 
redeemed shares of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A."
from the minority shareholders.
"The acquisition and redemption of shares 
of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A."
reduced equity within Siemens Energy AG’s consolidated financial statements.
"Recognizing 
Siemens’ share in this equity transaction decreased the carrying amount of our investment in Siemens Energy AG by €1,553 million, which 
is recognized in Equity directly."
"In March 2023, Siemens Energy AG completed a capital increase, in which Siemens did not participate."
"The transaction decreased Siemens’ stake in Siemens Energy AG from 35.1% to 31.9%, which resulted in a gain of €235 million, disclosed 
in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and in Reconciling items of Segment information."
"As of March 
31, 2023, the recoverable amount of our investment in Siemens Energy AG of €5.2 billion, determined based on its market capitalization 
(level 1 of the fair value hierarchy), increased significantly compared to the level when the impairment was recorded in fiscal 2022."
"This 
triggered a partial reversal of the previous impairment of €1,594 million, which is included in Income (loss) from investments accounted 
for using the equity method and in Reconciling items of Segment information."
"In June 2023, Siemens contributed a 6.8% stake in Siemens 
Energy AG (54 million shares) to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V."
at fair value (share price of €15.67; Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy).
Siemens’ stake in Siemens Energy AG declined from 31.9% to 25.1%.
"The contribution resulted in a gain of €318 million disclosed at 
Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and at Reconciling items of Segment information."
Below summarized consolidated financial information of Siemens Energy AG are disclosed at a 100 per cent basis.
"They are adjusted to 
align with Siemens’ accounting policies and to incorporate effects from fair value adjustments at initial recognition."
"As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the carrying amount of all individually not material joint ventures amounts to 
€334 million and €350 million, respectively."
"NOTE 6 Other operating expenses 
Other operating expenses in fiscal 2023, and 2022, include losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment as well as effects from 
insurance, personnel, legal and regulatory matters."
"In fiscal 2023 and 2022, deferred taxes include tax effects from the origination and reversal of 
temporary differences of €(670) million and €(430) million, respectively."
"In Germany, the calculation of current taxes is based on a combined tax rate of 31%, consisting of a corporate tax rate of 15%, a solidarity 
surcharge thereon of 5.5% and an average trade tax rate of 15%."
"For foreign subsidiaries, current taxes are calculated based on the local 
tax law and applicable tax rates in the individual foreign countries."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities in Germany and abroad are measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled."
"Global minimum taxation rules (Pillar Two) were enacted in some jurisdictions, in which Siemens currently operates."
"We expect to apply 
Pillar Two worldwide commencing with fiscal 2025 and anticipate an increase in current taxes in a low double-digit million euro range."
"A material portion thereof will expire until 2031 and 2030, respectively."
"Due to the low probability and the character of a contingent liability, no tax liability was recognized."
"In fiscal 2023 and 2022, finance income on the net investment in the lease is €372 million and €453 million."
"In fiscal 2023, and 2022, revenue includes 
€7,799 million and €6,158 million, respectively, which was included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal year."
"Compared to prior year, write-downs increased by €131 million in fiscal 2023."
"In fiscal 2022, write-downs increased by €94 
million compared to fiscal 2021."
"The determined fair value of the cash-generating units or groups of 
cash-generating units is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
"The fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the 
terminal value growth rate and discount rate."
"Both assumptions are determined individually for each cash-generating unit or group of 
cash-generating units."
Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
"Siemens Financial Services’ discount rate 
represents its specific cost of equity."
The discount rates are calculated based on a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk premium.
"In 
addition, the discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit or group of cash-
generating units by taking into account specific peer group information on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt as well as country 
specific premiums."
The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information.
"The peer group is 
subject to an annual review and adjusted, if necessary."
"Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic 
sources of data and industry specific trends."
"Siemens concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill 
in any of these groups of cash-generating units."
"The carrying amount of Advances to suppliers and construction in progress includes €1,125 million and €1,218 million, respectively, of 
property, plant and equipment under construction in fiscal 2023 and 2022."
"As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, contractual 
commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment are €694 million and €627 million, respectively."
"In fiscal 2023, Siemens Healthineers incurred impairment losses in the endovascular robotics solution business of €262 million, mainly on 
other intangible assets, due to a decision to refocus certain activities within this business."
"The impairment loss is primarily reported at Cost 
of sales."

"NOTE 17 Post-employment benefits 
Defined benefit plans 
The defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the Company."
"Only to a certain extent, 
those plans are affected by longevity, inflation and compensation increases and take country specific differences into account."
"The 
Company’s major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities."
"In accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest 
of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity."
"The defined benefit plans cover 442,000 
participants, including 183,000 actives, 82,000 deferreds with vested benefits and 177,000 retirees and surviving dependents."
"Germany 
In Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen 
legacy plans as well as deferred compensation plans."
The majority of active employees participate in the BSAV.
"Those benefits are based 
predominantly on notional contributions and the return on the corresponding assets of this plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed 
by the employer."
"At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the 
effects of compensation increases."
"However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and 
longevity risk."
The pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA).
"In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding 
requirements apply."
"In the U.S., the Pension Plans are sponsored by Siemens, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit 
accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts."
"Siemens has appointed the Investment Committee as the named fiduciary 
for the management of the assets of the Plans."
"The Plans’ assets are held in Trusts and the trustees of the Trusts are responsible for the 
administration of the assets of the Trusts, taking directions from the Investment Committee."
"The Plans are subject to the funding 
requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA)."
"There is a regulatory requirement to 
maintain a minimum funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions."
"At their discretion, sponsoring 
employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement."
Annual contributions are calculated by independent actuaries.
"Pension benefits are mainly offered through the Siemens Benefit Scheme for which, until the start of retirement, an inflation increase of 
the majority of accrued benefits is mandatory."
"The required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year 
based on legal requirements."
"Due to deviating guidelines for the determination of the discount rates, the technical funding deficit is usually 
larger than the IFRS funding deficit."
"To reduce the deficit Siemens entered into an agreement with the trustees to provide annual payments 
of £31 (€35) million until fiscal 2033."
"The agreement also provides for a cumulative advance payment by Siemens AG compensating the 
remaining annual payments at the date of early termination of the agreement due to cancellation or insolvency."

Switzerland 
Following the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying employees."
"Accordingly, Siemens in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans."
These plans are administered by external foundations.
"The board 
of the main foundation is composed of equally many employer and employee representatives."
"The board of the foundation is responsible 
for investment policy and asset management, as well as for any changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to finance 
the benefits."
"The Company is required to make total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee contributions set out in the 
plan rules."
"In case of an underfunded plan the Company together with the employees may be asked to pay supplementary contributions 
according to a well-defined framework of recovery measures."

"Asset Liability Matching Strategies 
As a significant risk, the Company considers a decline in the plans’ funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined 
benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters."
"Accordingly, Siemens implemented a risk management concept aligned with the 
defined benefit obligations (Asset Liability Matching)."
Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold (Value at Risk).
"The concept, the Value at Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing 
basis under consultation of senior external experts."
"Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and qualitative 
analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation."
Derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of risk management.
"The fair value of fixed income securities is based on prices provided by 
price service agencies."
The fixed income securities are traded in active markets and almost all fixed income securities are investment grade.
"Alternative investments include hedge funds, private equity and real estate investments, thereof real estate used by the Company with a 
fair value of €608 million and €734 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022."
"Multi strategy funds mainly comprise 
absolute return funds and diversified growth funds that invest in various asset classes within a single fund and aim to stabilize return and 
reduce volatility."
Derivatives predominantly consist of financial instruments for hedging interest rate risk and inflation risk.
"Future cash flows 
Employer contributions expected to be paid to defined benefit plans in fiscal 2024 are €230 million."
"Over the next ten fiscal years, average 
annual benefit payments of €1,945 million and €1,869 million, respectively, are expected as of September 30, 2023 and 2022."
"The 
weighted average duration of the DBO for Siemens defined benefit plans was 9 and 10 years, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and 
2022."
"Defined contribution plans and state plans 
Amounts recognized as expenses for defined contribution plans are €611 million and €611 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"Contributions to state plans amount to €1,723 million and €1,630 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022."
Warranties mainly relate to products sold.
"Order related losses and risks are provided for anticipated losses and risks on uncompleted 
construction, sales and leasing contracts."
"The Company is subject to asset retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant and equipment."
"Such asset retirement 
obligations are primarily attributable to environmental clean-up costs and to costs primarily associated with the removal of leasehold 
improvements at the end of the lease term."
"In May 2021, Siemens AG and the 
Federal Republic of Germany entered into a contract under public-law, based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is 
transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of €360 million."
"The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the 
approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules."
"As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the provisions 
total €480 million and €487 million, respectively."
"The provisions are for incurred 
and reported insurance losses as well as for incurred, hence, not yet reported insurance losses as of fiscal year-end."
"The provision is 
determined using actuarial standard valuation methodologies, which are parameterized based on historical loss data."
"Life reinsurance 
contracts have an average term of 19 years, whereas the cash outflows for the industrial business reinsurance contracts are expected 
within the next five years."
"Other also includes provisions for Legal Proceedings, as far as the risks that are subject to such Legal Proceedings 
are not already covered by project accounting."
"Provisions for Legal Proceedings amounted to €227 million and €236 million as of 
September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, €260 million and €181 million are included for claims 
and charges resulting from the construction business."
"Furthermore, Other includes provision for indemnifications in connection with 
dispositions of businesses of €82 million and €92 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022."
"Such indemnifications may protect the 
buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business."
"NOTE 19 Equity 
As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Siemens’ issued capital is divided into 800 million and 850 million registered shares, respectively, 
with no par value and a notional value of €3.00 per share."
The shares are paid in full.
"At the Shareholders’ Meeting, each share has one 
vote and accounts for the shareholders’ proportionate share in the Company’s net income."
"All shares confer the same rights and 
obligations."
"In fiscal 2023, Siemens cancelled 50 million treasury shares, thereby reducing issued capital by €150 million to €2.4 billion."
"In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Siemens repurchased 6,853,091 shares and 14,185,791 shares, respectively."
"In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Siemens 
transferred 4,227,344 and 4,376,201 treasury shares, respectively."
"As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company has treasury shares 
of 10,079,918 and 57,454,171 respectively."

various time-limited authorizations, by issuance of up to 200 million registered shares of no par value."
"Dividends paid per share were €4.25 and €4.00, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022."
"The Managing Board and the Supervisory Board 
propose to distribute a dividend of €4.70 per share to holders entitled to dividends, in total representing approximately €3.7 billion in 
expected payments."
"Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval at the Shareholders’ Meeting on February 8, 2024."
"NOTE 20 Additional capital disclosures 
A key consideration of our capital structure management is to maintain ready access to capital markets through various debt instruments 
and to sustain our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time."
"In order to achieve our target, Siemens intends to maintain 
an Industrial net debt divided by EBITDA (continuing operations) ratio of up to 1.5 in accordance with our Financial Framework."
"The ratio 
indicates the approximate number of years that would be needed to cover the Industrial net debt through Income from continuing 
operations, excluding interest, other financial income (expenses), taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments."
"Accordingly, debt in a hedging relationship is adjusted for fair values of interest hedges as well as for foreign currency hedge effects."
"Siemens deducts resulting changes in fair value, to derive an amount of debt that approximates the amount that will be repaid."
2 The adjustment considers that both Moody’s and S&P view Siemens Financial Services as a captive finance company.
"These rating agencies generally recognize and accept higher levels of debt attributable to captive  
   finance subsidiaries in determining credit ratings."
"Following this concept, Siemens excludes Siemens Financial Services debt."
"Consolidated Financial Statements

The SFS business is capital intensive and operates with a larger amount of debt to finance its operations compared to the industrial 
business."
"Additionally, credit guarantees 
are issued in the course of the SFS business."
"Credit guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary 
debtor, Siemens will be required to settle such financial obligations."
"The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the outstanding 
balance of the credit or, in case a credit line is subject to variable utilization, the nominal amount of the credit line."
"These guarantees have 
typically residual terms of up to three years (in fiscal 2022 four years)."
"The Company held collateral mainly through inventories and trade 
receivables."
"As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Credit guarantees include €95 million and €123 million for which Siemens holds 
reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy."
"Siemens accrued €18 million and €2 million relating to credit guarantees as of September 
30, 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"Furthermore, Siemens issues performance guarantees, which mainly include performance bonds."
"In the event of non-fulfillment of 
contractual obligations by the primary obligor, Siemens will be required to pay up to an agreed-upon maximum amount."
"These agreements 
typically have terms of up to ten years."
"As 
of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company accrued €58 million and €54 million, respectively, relating to performance guarantees."
"As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, in addition to guarantees disclosed in the table above, there are contingent liabilities of €402 million 
and €421 million which mainly result from other guarantees and legal proceedings."
"Other guarantees include €71 million and €99 million 
for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy."
"NOTE 22 Legal proceedings 
Siemens is involved in numerous Legal Proceedings in various jurisdictions."
"These Legal Proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens 
being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit."
"In individual 
cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits."
"In addition, 
further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be extended."
"Asserted claims are generally 
subject to interest rates."
"Some of these Legal Proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens, which may have material effects on its business activities 
as well as its financial position, results of operations and cash flows."
"For Legal Proceedings information required under IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed if the 
Company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the matter."

Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
"The Company 
also accounts for foreign currency derivatives, which are embedded in sale and purchase contracts."
"Cash flow hedges 
The Company’s operating units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and firm commitments denominated 
in foreign currencies."
"Particularly, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future 
cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments."
"The risk mainly results from contracts denominated 
in US$ both from Siemens’ operating units entering into long-term contracts e.g."
"from the project business and from the standard product

"NOTE 25 Financial risk management 
Increasing market fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risk for Siemens."
"The Company’s operating 
business as well as its investment and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates."
"In order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across Siemens' segments and entities, as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens 
identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks."
"The Company seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its 
regular operating and financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate."
Foreign currency exchange rate risk is quantified based on a sensitivity analysis.
"In order to quantify remaining market risks Siemens has 
implemented a system based on Value at Risk (VaR), which is also used for internal management of Corporate Treasury activities."
"The VaR 
figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors, a ten day holding period, and a 99.5% 
confidence level."
"Actual results that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may 
differ substantially from VaR figures due to fundamental conceptual differences."
"Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some 
limitations including the following."
"A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within this 
period."
This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets.
"A 99.5% confidence level means that there is a 0.5% statistical 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
33 
probability that losses could exceed the calculated VaR."
"The use of historical data as a basis for estimating the statistic behavior of the 
relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always 
cover all possible scenarios, especially those of an exceptional nature."
"Any market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-bearing investments that our Company’s pension plans hold are not 
included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures."
"Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
Transaction risk 
Each Siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other 
than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates."
"In the ordinary course of business, 
Siemens units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U.S."
"Foreign 
currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well 
as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets."
Operating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a speculative basis.
"Intercompany financing or 
investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis."
"According to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction 
exposure."
"Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is 
generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury."
"Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from planned 
business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at 
least three months."
"Generally, the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with Corporate Treasury."
"By applying a cost-optimizing portfolio 
approach, Corporate Treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them."
"The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a reasonably possible change in the euro versus the most 
important currency exchange rates compared to the respective year-end exchange rates."
"The analysis does not include effects of foreign 
currency translation."
"The effect on net income is due to changes in the fair values of monetary assets and liabilities including non-
designated foreign currency derivatives and embedded derivatives."
"The effect on equity is due to changes in the fair values of forward 
exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges."
"In fiscal 2023, the sensitivity of net income with regard to the U.S."
"dollar decreased 
compared to the prior year mainly due to a decrease of monetary assets and liabilities and a higher hedge ratio."
"The sensitivity of equity 
with regard to the U.S."
dollar decreased due to a decline in the nominal amount of U.S.
"dollar forward exchange contracts designated as 
cash flow hedges."
"Translation risk 
Many Siemens units are located outside the Eurozone."
"Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens is the euro, the financial 
statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"To consider the 
effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based operations 
are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous."
"Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net 
asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Company’s consolidated equity position."
"Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates."
This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different.
"The interest rate risk is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach 
and results primarily from funding in the U.S."
"dollar, British pound and euro."
"This includes SFS business, for which the interest rate risk 
was formerly managed separately."
"If there are no conflicting country-specific regulations, all Siemens operating units generally obtain any required financing through 
Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts."
"The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated 
by the units."
"As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the VaR relating to the interest rate was €683 million and €864 million."
"The decrease was driven 
mainly by a decrease in interest rate sensitivity for the U.S."

(in Mio."
"Siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is 
aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion."
"Siemens mitigates liquidity 
risk by the implementation of effective working capital and cash management, arranged credit facilities with highly rated financial 
institutions, via a debt issuance program and via a global multi-currency commercial paper program."
"Liquidity risk may also be mitigated 
by the Siemens Bank GmbH, which increases the flexibility of depositing cash or refinancing."
"In addition, Siemens constantly monitors funding options available in the capital markets, as well as trends in the availability and costs of 
such funding, with a view to maintaining financial flexibility and limiting repayment risks."
"The following table reflects our contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement, repayments and interest."
"The disclosed expected undiscounted 
net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument and based 
on the earliest date on which Siemens could be required to pay."
"Cash outflows for financial liabilities (including interest) without fixed 
amount or timing are based on the conditions existing at September 30, 2023."
² A considerable portion result from asset-based lending transactions meaning that the respective loans can only be drawn after sufficient collateral has been provided by the borrower.
"Credit risk 
Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is failing to discharge its obligations in full 
and on time or if the value of collateral declines."
Siemens provides its customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing particularly in connection with large projects.
"Hence, 
credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors, the recoverability of the collaterals, the success of projects we invested in and 
the global economic development."
"The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management 
system."
"In this context, Siemens has implemented a binding credit policy."
"Siemens maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units from the Siemens Group regularly transfer business 
partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process."
"Due to the identification, quantification 
and active management of credit risks, this increases credit risk transparency."
"Ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained from 
customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and Siemens’ credit default experiences."
"The ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit 
ratings."
An exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations.
"A range of internally defined events 
trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables being more than 90 days past due, or a default 
rating by an external rating agency."
"To analyze and monitor credit risks, the Company applies various systems and processes."
"A main element is a central IT application that 
processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate, which may be used as a basis 
for individual bad debt provisions."
"Additionally, qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments."
"The carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial asset’s credit risk, without taking account of any collateral."
"Collateral reduces 
the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk."
"Collateral needs to be specific, identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken 
into account."
Those collaterals are mostly held in the portfolio of SFS.
"As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, collateral of €863 million and €1,444 million, respectively, relate to financial assets measured at fair 
value."
"Those collaterals are provided in connection with netting agreements for derivatives providing protection from the risk of a 
counterparty’s insolvency."
"As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, collateral held for credit-impaired receivables from finance leases 
amounted to €66 million and €53 million, respectively."
"Those collaterals mainly comprised property, plant and equipment."
"Credit risks arising 
from irrevocable loan commitments are equal to the expected future pay-offs resulting from these commitments."
"Contract assets 
generally show similar risk characteristics as trade receivables in operating units."
"Amounts above do not represent economic credit risk, since they consider neither collateral held nor valuation allowances already 
recognized."
"Equity Price Risk 
Siemens‘ investment portfolio consists of direct and indirect investments in publicly traded companies that are classified as long term 
investments."
"These investments are monitored based on their current market value, affected primarily by fluctuations on the volatile 
technology-related markets worldwide."
"As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the market value of Siemens’ portfolio was €182 million and 
€339 million, respectively."
"As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the VaR relating to the equity price was €26 million and €74 million."
"NOTE 26 Share-based payment 
Share-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of Siemens AG, in treasury shares or in cash."
"Share-

"In addition, we have audited the group management report of Siemens 
Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, for the fiscal year from October 1, 
2022 to September 30, 2023."
"In all material respects, 
this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and 
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development."
"322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"Basis for the opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec."
"317 HGB 
and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in 
Germany] (IDW)."
"We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International 
Standards on Auditing (ISAs)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the “Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional 
law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance 
with Art."
"10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art."
"5 (1) of the 
EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters."
"Revenue from long-term construction-type contracts is recognized in 
accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, generally over time under the percentage-of-completion method."
"Independent Auditor’s Reports (Group) 
 
3 
Revenues, total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge 
about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a construction-type contract."
"The effects of current geopolitical and macroeconomic developments on the project business, such as delays in project execution, price 
increases or disruptions in supply chains and their accounting treatment were taken into account during our audit."
"Auditor’s response: As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group’s internally established methods, processes and 
control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of construction-type contracts."
"We also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates, the timely and 
complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation as well as their accounting treatment."
"As part of our substantive audit procedures, which particularly involved project reviews, we evaluated management’s estimates and 
assumptions based on a risk-based selection of a sample of contracts."
"Our audit procedures included, among others, review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial 
deliveries and services, termination rights, penalties for delay and breach of contract, liquidated damages as well as joint and several 
liability."
"For this we also assessed the accounting for contractually agreed options, contract amendments or contract terminations (including 
related pending legal proceedings) also in relation to previous construction-type contracts with Russian customers."
"We also assessed the 
recognition requirements of reimbursement claims."
"To identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project KPIs, we also applied data analysis procedures."
"In designing our 
audit procedures, we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function."
"Furthermore, we obtained 
evidence from third parties for selected projects (e.g., project acceptance documentation, contractual terms and conditions, and lawyers’ 
confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims) and inspected the status of projects at plant sites."
"Due to the 
large contract volume and risk profile, our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of high-speed and commuter trains."
Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to revenue recognition on construction-type contracts.
"Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for construction-type 
contracts, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"With respect to contract assets and liabilities as well as provisions for order related losses and risks, refer to Note 10 Contract 
assets and liabilities, Note 18 Provisions and Note 21 Commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"The investment is 
accounted for as an associate, applying the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures."
"As of 
June 30, 2022, an impairment was recognized on the investment."
"During the first six months of the financial year 2023, the market 
capitalization of the investment was mostly higher than the value at the time of the impairment."
"As of March 31, 2023, the latter was 
significantly exceeded."
"As a result, an impairment reversal was made in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, in the amount of 
the increase in the stock market price since the date of the impairment until March 31, 2023."
"In addition, Siemens Energy AG acquired 
additional shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A."
"This led to a reduction in equity in the consolidated 
financial statements of Siemens Energy AG."
"The recognition of Siemens’ share in this equity transaction resulted in a reduction of the 
carrying amount of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, which was recognized directly in Siemens’ equity."
"As of September 30, 2023, 
the pro rata market value of the investment was above the book value."
"In addition, we evaluated the calculation of the reversal of 
the impairment as of March 31, 2023."
"Independent Auditor’s Reports (Group) 
 
4 
In order to assess the valuation of the investment in fiscal year 2023, we also considered the effects for Siemens AG from the acquisition 
of the shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
"by Siemens Energy AG, the capital increase of Siemens Energy AG and the 
contribution of shares in Siemens Energy AG to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations regarding the valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG as of September 
30, 2023."
"Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for investments in 
associates, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"Details on the reversal of the impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG and the other described transactions are 
presented in Note 4 Interests in other entities."
"Regarding the subsequent events relating to the investment in Siemens Energy AG refer to 
Note 34 Subsequent events."
"These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and 
measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance."
"Auditor’s response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, 
we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings."
"Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of 
legal matters not yet considered."
"Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures on proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged 
compliance violations."
"Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for provisions, refer to 
Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"With respect 
to proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, refer to Note 22 Legal proceedings."
"Uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes 
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Siemens operates in numerous countries with different local tax 
legislation."
"The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment 
and make estimates and assumptions and was therefore a key audit matter."
"In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness 
of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities."
"Auditor’s response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of relevant local tax law, we examined the 
processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions."
"In particular, this includes the tax implications arising 
from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company 
shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities."
"In order to assess measurement and completeness, we also obtained 
confirmations from external tax advisors."
"Further, we evaluated management’s assessments with respect to the prospects of success of 
appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law."
"In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management’s assumptions with respect to tax planning 
strategies and projected future taxable income and compared them to internal business plans."
"In the course of our audit procedures 
regarding deferred tax liabilities, we examined in particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of subsidiaries’ retained profits for an 
indefinite period and assessed these taking into account dividend planning."
Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes.
"With respect 
to disclosures for deferred tax assets and liabilities, refer to Note 7 Income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."

Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the declaration pursuant to Sec.
"161 AktG [“Aktiengesetz”: 
German Stock Corporation Act] on the Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the Corporate Governance Statement, and for the 
Compensation Report."
"In all other respects, management is responsible for the other information."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and 
consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact."
We have nothing to report in this regard.
"315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern."
"It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, management is 
responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or 
to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements and of the group management report."
"Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec."

the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated

by the IDW and in supplementary compliance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report."
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our respective opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report."
"We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit."
"We remain solely responsible for our opinions; 
• evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, 
and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
• perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group management report.
"On the basis of 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the 
prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not express 
a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that 
future events will differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, 
and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where 
applicable, the related safeguards."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."

"Responsibilities of management  
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure in accordance with Art."

methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual disclosures that are reasonable in the circumstances."

management is responsible for such internal control as management considers necessary to enable the preparation of the EU Taxonomy 
disclosure that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipulation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure) or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable 
interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case."

performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is 
obtained."
The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the auditor.
In determining the disclosures in accordance with Art.

"Notes to Annual Financial Statements 
3.1 General Disclosures 
Siemens AG has registered offices in Berlin and Munich, Germany."
"The Company is registered in the commercial register maintained by 
the local courts in Berlin Charlottenburg, Germany, under the entry number HRB 12300, and in Munich, Germany, under the entry number 
HRB 6684."
"The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth in the German 
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG)."
"Amounts are presented in 
millions of euros (€ million)."
"Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided."
"3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles 
Revenue are proceeds from selling and leasing products, providing services and granting licenses, including licensing contracts for the 
use of the Siemens trademark."
"Negative interest from financial investments is presented as a deduction in interest income, and positive interest from borrowings as a 
deduction in interest expenses."
"Intangible assets acquired for consideration are capitalized at acquisition costs and amortized on a straight-line basis over a maximum of 
five years or, if longer, the contractually agreed useful life."
Items are amortized on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition.
"The 
capitalization option for internally generated intangible assets is not used."
Acquired goodwill is generally amortized systematically over the expected useful life of five to 15 years.
"The expected useful life is based 
on the expected use of the acquired businesses and is determined in particular by economic factors such as future growth and profit 
expectations, synergy effects and employee base."
"Property, plant and equipment: The components of production costs are described in the context of the explanations for inventories."
"In 
general, property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method."
"In certain cases, the declining balance method is 
applied, whereby a switch is made from the declining balance to the straight-line method as soon as the latter results in higher depreciation 
expense."
Items are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition.
"Low-value non-current assets that are subject to 
wear and tear, movable, and capable of being used independently, are expensed immediately or capitalized and fully depreciated in the 
year of acquisition."
Financial assets: Impairment losses are recognized if the decline in value is presumed to be other than temporary.
"This applies, if objective 
evidence, particularly events or changes in circumstances, indicate a significant or other than temporary decline in value."
"In case of an 
impairment in prior periods, a lower recognized value may not be maintained if the reasons for the impairment do no longer exist."
Inventories are measured at the lower of average acquisition or production costs and daily values.
"Production costs comprise, in addition 
to direct costs, an appropriate portion of production and material overheads and depreciation of property, plant and equipment."
"General 
administration expenses, expenses for social facilities, voluntary social costs and company pension scheme costs are not capitalized."
"Write-
downs are recorded to cover inventory risks for reduced usability and technological obsolescence as well as in the context of loss-free 
valuation of unbilled contracts in construction-type and service businesses."
Allowances on receivables are determined on the basis of the probability of default and country risks.
"Deferred tax assets for differences between valuations of balance sheet line items in accordance to commercial and tax law and tax loss 
carryforwards are recognized if a future tax benefit is expected."
Deferred tax assets are netted with deferred tax liabilities.
"Offsetting of assets and of income and expenses: Siemens AG measures assets at fair value that are designated as being held exclusively 
to settle specified pension obligations and obligations for early retirement (“Altersteilzeit”) arrangements and which cannot be accessed 
by other creditors."
"Pensions and similar commitments: Siemens AG measures its pension obligations using the settlement amount calculated with the 
actuarial projected unit credit method on the basis of biometric probabilities."
"The discount rate used corresponds to the average market 
interest rate for instruments with an assumed remaining maturity of 15 years as published by German Federal Reserve Bank (Deutsche 
Bundesbank)."
"Annual Financial Statements 
6 
Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying 
assets at the balance sheet date."
"If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the pension provision is 
measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value."
"According to the Act on the Improvement of Company Pensions (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung), Siemens 
AG is secondarily liable for pension benefits provided under an indirect pension funding vehicle (mittelbarer Durchführungsweg)."
"Siemens 
AG recognizes the underfunding in the item Provisions for pensions and similar commitments as far as the respective assets of the pension 
fund or of the pension and support fund (Pensions- und Unterstützungskasse) do not cover the settlement amount of the respective 
pension obligations."
"Provisions for agreed personnel restructuring measures were recognized for legal and constructive 
obligations."
"Significant provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted using a discount rate which corresponds 
to the average market interest rate appropriate for the remaining term of the obligations, as calculated and published by Deutsche 
Bundesbank."
"Balance Sheet line items denominated in foreign currency 
which are part of a valuation unit used to hedge foreign currency risk are measured using the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction 
date."
"Non-current assets and inventories acquired in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on 
the transaction date."
"Guarantees and other commitments: Siemens AG issues parent company guarantees, i.e."
"guarantees to ensure performance obligations 
incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and long-term investee companies or their parent companies."
"Credit lines included in the guarantee obligations in the context of financing affiliated 
companies are recognized at their nominal amount."
"Derivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and – if the relevant conditions are 
met – are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units."
"When a valuation unit is created, changes in values or cash 
flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared."
"A provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective 
part of the market value changes."
"The unrealized gains and losses from the effective part offset each other completely and are not 
recognized in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement."
Siemens AG discloses these items separately in the notes.
"Income from the release of 
the special reserve with an equity portion was €1 million (2022: €1 million)."
"Other operating expenses included a loss of €196 million on the disposal relating to the carve-out of business activities into Innomotics 
GmbH, Germany (a supplier of engines and large drives)."
"Income from profit transfer agreements with affiliated companies included profit transfers from Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH, 
Germany, amounting to €1,323 million, and from Siemens Financial Services GmbH, Germany, amounting to €188 million."
"Impairments on investments included an impairment of €164 million on a stake in Thoughtworks Holding, Inc., U.S."
"In fiscal year 2023, Siemens AG sold 3.5% of the shares in Siemens Energy AG that were held as pension assets at that time."
"This resulted 
in a gain of €213 million from the disposal of investments."
"As of the balance sheet date, Siemens AG directly held a 21.0% stake in Siemens 
Energy AG."
"A reversal of impairment in the amount of €166 million was made on these shares based on Xetra closing price on the balance 
sheet date."
"As of the reporting date, the carrying amount of the investment in Siemens Energy AG amounted to €2.1 billion."
"Interest income included interest income from affiliated companies 
of €890 million (2022: €347 million)."
"Interest expenses included interest expenses from affiliated companies of €1,548 million (2022: 
€67 million interest income)."
Interest income from loans of non-current financial assets amounted to €113 million (2022: €80 million).
"NOTE 7 Other taxes 
Other taxes of €21 million (2022: €11 million) were included in functional costs."
"NOTE 8 Income relating to prior periods 
The income statement of Siemens AG included income relating to prior periods of €520 million, resulting mainly from the release of 
provisions."
"NOTE 9 Expenses relating to prior periods 
The income statement of Siemens AG included expenses relating to prior periods of €34 million."
"Total impairments of non-current assets were €179 million (2022: €4,268 million)."
"NOTE 13 Deferred tax assets 
Deferred tax assets resulted mainly from pension provisions and pension-related assets, from deferred taxes of companies forming part of 
the Siemens AG tax group, as well as from other provisions and tax loss carryforwards."
"Deferred taxes from partnerships had an offsetting 
effect."
"For the measurement of deferred taxes, a tax rate of 31.33% was applied."
"Deviating from this, a tax rate of 15.83% was applied for 
temporary differences related to assets, liabilities and prepaid/deferred items of partnerships."
"Authorized capital 
As of September 30, 2023, Siemens AG had authorized capital totaling a nominal amount of €600 million, which can be issued in 
instalments and with different time limits by issuing up to 200 million registered no-par value shares."
Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded.
"The new shares may exclusively be offered to 
employees of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies (employee shares)."
"To the extent permitted by law, employee shares may also be 
issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the 
Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para."
"2 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act."
"Under certain 
conditions, the Managing Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights 
in the event of issue against contributions in kind."
"In the case of issue against cash payment, the shares are generally to be offered to 
shareholders for subscription."
"On June 24, 2021, Siemens announced a share buyback with a volume of up to €3 billion in the period from the beginning of fiscal 2022 
to 2026."
"The share buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and will run no longer than until September 15, 2026, is executed based 
on the authorizations granted by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on February 5, 2020."
"In addition to the dividend policy, the share 
buyback is intended to allow shareholders to continuously participate in the success of the Company."
"In fiscal 2023, Siemens AG 
repurchased a total of 6,853,091 treasury shares under this buyback program."
"This represented a nominal amount of €21 million or 0.9% 
of capital stock."
"In the current reporting period, €884 million (excluding incidental transaction charges) were spent for this purpose; this 
represents a weighted average stock price of €129.04 per share."
"The purchases were made in the reporting period on 248 Xetra trading 
days and were carried out by a bank that had been commissioned by Siemens AG; the shares were purchased exclusively on the electronic 
trading platform of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra)."
"The average volume on these trading days was about 27,633 shares."
"Following the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the Management Board resolved to redeem 50,000,000 treasury shares."
"In fiscal 2023, Siemens AG re-issued in total 4,227,344 treasury shares under the exclusion of subscription rights in connection with share-
based payments and employee share programs in the Group, equaling a nominal amount of €13 million and 0.5% of capital stock."
"The 
Company received in total €236 million for 1,843,831 shares, re-issued against payment of a purchase price."
"Siemens AG received this 
amount for unrestricted use."
All shares were sold as investment shares in connection with the share matching program to plan participants.
"In each case, the purchase price was determined on the basis of the closing rate in Xetra trading, determined on a monthly effective date."
"The other shares re-issued during the reporting period can be primarily attributed to the servicing of stock 
awards granted in fiscal 2019 totaling 1,693,126 shares, to 573,467 matching shares under the share matching program for fiscal 2020, 
and to 116,920 jubilee shares."
"The unappropriated net 
income of €3,760 million is available for distribution."
"Disclosures on shareholdings of Siemens AG 
As of September 30, 2023, the following information on shareholdings subject to reporting requirements was available to the Company 
pursuant to Section 160 para 1 No."
"NOTE 16 Provisions for pensions and similar commitments 
In Germany, Siemens AG provides pension benefits through the BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans 
and deferred compensation plans."
The majority of Siemens’ active employees participate in the BSAV.
"The benefits are predominantly 
based on nominal contributions by the Company and investment returns on assets designated to that plan, subject to a minimum return 
guaranteed by the Company."
"At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially 
eliminate the effects of compensation increases."
"However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, 
inflation risk and longevity risk."
The pension benefits are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA).
"A portion of these trust assets 
also covers the pension obligations of other domestic subsidiaries."
"Therefore, the assets do not meet the criteria for offsetting against the 
pension obligation and are presented as financial assets of Siemens AG."
"The actuarial assumptions for valuation of the settlement amount as of September 30, 2023 were based, among others, on a discount 
rate of 1.81% and an average weighted pension increase of 2.40% p.a."
"The mortality tables used (Siemens Bio 2017/2023) are primarily 
based on data of the German Siemens population, using a set of formulas that corresponds to generally accepted actuarial standards."
"In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a public-law contract based on which the obligation of final 
disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of €360 million."
"The contract and therefore the 
payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules."
"Expenses for pensions mainly included effects from pension increases due to the 
continued high consumer price index as part of the actuarial valuation of the settlement amount of pension obligations."
"For the purpose of 
servicing share-based payment programs, Siemens AG also delivers Siemens shares, which have been granted by affiliated companies."
"Stock Awards 
Siemens AG grants stock awards to members of the Managing Board, members of the senior management and other eligible employees."
"Share Matching Program  
Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously 
held over a vesting period."
"Exceptions were those shares which 
represented plan assets and therefore were not accessible by all other creditors."
"These shares are held exclusively for the purpose of 
settling liabilities arising from post-employment obligations or comparable obligations with a long-term maturity, and are to be offset 
against such liabilities."
"In addition, the items included indemnifications issued in connection with dispositions 
of businesses."
"Such indemnifications, if customary to the relevant transactions, may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other 
risks in conjunction with the purchased business."
Warranty obligations included obligations of Siemens AG towards affiliated companies totaling €1.0 billion.
"For this reason, Siemens AG considered it not probable that it will 
be called upon in conjunction with any of the guarantees and commitments described above."
"Object of these contracts were mainly 
real estate and other non-current assets."
"Payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements amounted to €1,334 million, of which €201 million resulted from transactions 
with affiliated companies."
"Payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements due within the next fiscal year amounted to €247 
million."
"NOTE 25 Other financial obligations 
Approximately €1.5 billion were outstanding as of September 30, 2023, from an outsourcing agreement with a maturity of several years."
Obligations for equity contributions to affiliated companies amounted to €491 million.
Siemens AG has entered into a contract to pay its affiliated company Siemens Trademark GmbH & Co.
"KG, Germany, a running royalty for 
the use of the Siemens trademark rights."
The fee is calculated by applying business-specific royalty rates to brand-related revenue.
"The 
contract has an indefinite duration."
"For fiscal 2023, the corresponding expenses amounted to €988 million."
"For fiscal 2024, the royalty is 
expected to be in the same magnitude."
"In the course of its normal business operations, Siemens AG is involved in numerous legal and regulatory proceedings as well as 
governmental investigations (legal proceedings) in various jurisdictions."
"These legal proceedings could result in particular in the Company 
being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or criminal or civil sanctions, fines or disgorgements of 
profit."
"In individual cases, this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or 
permits."
"In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be expanded."
"Some 
of these legal proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens AG that may have material effects on its financial position, the 
results of its operations and/or its cash flows in the respective reporting period."
"In addition, Siemens is jointly and severally liable within 
consortia."
"As far as not recognized in the financial statements, Siemens AG did not expect any material negative effects on its financial 
position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows at balance sheet date."
"As the parent company of the Siemens Group, Siemens AG has the central role within the group-wide management of financial 
market risks."
"To manage the risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Siemens AG uses primarily foreign currency 
forward contracts, interest rate swaps as well as combined interest and foreign currency swaps."
"Thereby the operating units of Siemens 
AG are not allowed to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes."
"The contract partners of the Company for 
derivative financial instruments are banks, brokers and affiliated companies."
"The credit rating for banks and brokers is constantly 
monitored."
"Fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting expected future cash flows over the remaining term of 
the instrument using current market interest rates and yield curves."
"Using the freezing method, the hedging transactions are not recognized in the balance sheet."
"The effectiveness of the valuation 
unit is either ensured through risk management, or is demonstrated both prospectively and retrospectively based on appropriate methods 
used to demonstrate effectiveness (e.g."
"dollar offset method, regression method, sensitivity analysis)."
"Valuation gains and losses from 
derivative financial instruments and hedged items are netted for each valuation unit."
"A provision for anticipated losses on onerous 
contracts is recognized for the respective valuation unit in the amount of an existing loss surplus."
Profit surpluses are not recognized.
"Valuation unit used to hedge the foreign currency risk  
According to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction 
exposure."
"Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is 
generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury."
"Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from 
planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period 
of at least three months."
"The remaining foreign currency risk after offsetting cash flows in the same currency is hedged by the Corporate Treasury with external 
contract partners."
"The net foreign currency position (before hedging) is combined with the offsetting foreign currency exchange contracts 
to a macro valuation unit."
"For this purpose, hedged items and hedging instruments are measured with the respective underlying 
discounted cash flows."
"For foreign currency derivative financial instruments, the determination is based on the changes in relevant forward 
exchange rates."
"The existing derivative currency hedging contracts are included in the valuation unit in their entirety and had maturity 
terms until the year 2041."
"The cash in- and outflows from the foreign currency exchange contracts, firm commitments and forecast 
transactions are disclosed on a net basis in the following table."
"As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of derivative financial instruments from foreign currency hedging transactions was €(4) million, 
net."
"Positive fair values of €1,897 million were offset by negative fair values of €1,901 million."
"For derivative financial instruments with 
negative fair values, no provision for anticipated losses was recognized as part of the valuation unit."
"Valuation unit used to hedge the interest rate risk  
The interest rate hedging contracts used by Siemens AG serve to reduce interest rate risks within the framework of an integrated asset-
liability management approach and to optimize the interest results."
"Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties to hedge interest rate swaps with its affiliated companies 
against interest rate risk."
"As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate swaps with affiliated companies with a maximum maturity term until 
the year 2028 included in this macro-valuation unit had a notional amount of €2,121 million and fair values of €122 million."
"At balance 
sheet date, these underlying transactions were matched by external interest rate derivatives with negative fair values of €59 million, net, 
and a maximum maturity term until the year 2030."
"To hedge interest rate risks arising from payables to affiliated companies, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with 
external counterparties."
"As of September 30, 2023, the liabilities hedged in this micro-valuation unit had a nominal volume of €2,347 
million and a maximum maturity term until the year 2025."
"As of September 30, 2023, the positive cumulative changes in the market value 
of these payables of €86 million were offset by external interest rate derivatives with identical maturities whose negative market value 
was €78 million."
"Annual Financial Statements 
17 
The amount of interest rate risks hedged with the valuation unit, which did not lead to a provision for anticipated losses, totaled €165 
million."
"NOTE 28 Remuneration of the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board 
Remuneration of the members of the Managing Board  
Members of the Managing Board received cash compensation of €18.8 million."
"The fair value of share-based compensation amounted to 
€10.5 million for 170,111 stock awards."
"The Company granted contributions under the BSAV to members of the Managing Board totaling 
€2.2 million."
"Therefore, the compensation and benefits attributable to members of the Managing Board amounted to €31.6 million in total."
"Total remuneration of former members of the Managing Board  
Former members of the Managing Board and their surviving dependents received a total of €24.6 million according to Section 285 no."

"In addition, we have audited the 
management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the group management report, for the fiscal year from 
October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023."
"In all material respects, this 
management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately 
presents the opportunities and risks of future development."
"322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the 
annual financial statements and of the management report."
"Basis for the opinions 
We conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with Sec."
"317 HGB and the EU 
Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted 
Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
In conducting the audit of the annual financial statements we also complied with International Standards on Auditing (ISA).
"Our 
responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the annual financial statements and of the management report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the Company in 
accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German 
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Art."
"10 (2) f) of the EU Audit 
Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art."
5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.
"We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the annual financial statements 
and on the management report."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the annual financial statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial 
statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters."
"The determination of the fair values of non-current financial assets also depends to a large extent on the assessment of future cash inflows 
and the discount rate applied."
"In case of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, in which 21,0% are held directly, the market capitalization during fiscal 2023 was on 
average above the book value sometimes significantly."
"As of September 30, 2023, a reversal of impairment to the stock market price has 
been recorded, following an impairment as of September 30, 2022."
"We assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of the net realizable value in terms of methodology and reperformed 
the calculations with the assistance of internal valuation specialists."
"We further obtained explanations from management regarding 
material value drivers of the planning and examined whether the budget planning reflects general and industry-specific market 
expectations."
"Forecast accuracy was assessed on a sample basis using budget-to-actual comparisons of historically forecast data with the 
actual results."
"The parameters used to estimate net realizable value such as the estimated growth rates and the weighted average cost of 
capital rates were assessed by comparing them to publicly available market data."
"We also performed our own sensitivity analyses to assess 
the impairment risk in the case of a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions."
"With regard to the reversal of impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we have traced the development of the stock market 
price and assessed the calculation of the reversal of impairment as of September 30, 2023, considering the acquisition costs of the 
investment."
"Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures in the notes to the annual financial statements regarding the subsequent events relating to the 
investment in Siemens Energy AG."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of non-current financial assets as of September 30, 2023."
"These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on 
the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance."
"Auditor’s response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, 
we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings."
"Furthermore, we examined legal 
consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged 
compliance violations."
"Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for other provisions, 
refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements."
"With respect to the legal proceedings, 
regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations, refer to chapter 3.5 Other Disclosures, Note 25 Other financial obligations."
"In 
particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions as well as the recoverability of deferred tax assets."
"Auditor’s response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of tax law, we examined the processes installed 
by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions."
"In particular, this includes the tax implications arising 
from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company 
shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities."
"In order to assess measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, 
we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors."
"Further, we evaluated management’s assessments with respect to the prospects 
of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current 
tax case law."
"Independent Auditor’s Report (Siemens AG) 
4 
In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management’s assumptions with respect to tax planning 
strategies and projected future taxable income and compared them to internal business plans."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the assessment of the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets."

FISCAL 2023 
4 
A."
Siemens AG began fiscal 2023 spurred by a strong performance in fiscal 2022.
"However, the economic and political 
environment still contained a large number of uncertainties."
"Although new variants of the coronavirus did not produce the 
negative impacts feared and a crisis in gas and electricity supplies failed to materialize, the economic situation began to 
weaken – particularly in Germany, the Company’s home market."
"The war in Ukraine continued as did tensions between the 
western democracies and China."
"On the other hand, supply chain pressures eased."
"Due to a sharp increase in inflation, all 
major central banks raised their interest rates to levels not seen since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008."
"In Europe, 
high energy prices burdened economic development, while, in the U.S., consumption and the labor market in particular 
proved to be very resilient despite the interest rate increases."
"Growth in China – which had been strong following the 
relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in Q1 of fiscal 2023 – slowed due to the normalization of inventories, which had built 
up during the pandemic, and as a result of the burdens imposed by the crisis in China’s real estate market."
"Siemens AG’s 
markets benefited from high order backlogs, positive price developments and customers’ efforts to become more resilient, 
more competitive and more sustainable."
"As a leading technology company, Siemens partners closely with other companies, industries and innovators in order to 
combine the real and the digital worlds."
"In this context, the Company focuses on accelerated, high-value growth."
"The 
Managing Board compensation determined by the Supervisory Board fosters the implementation of the Company’s strategic 
targets by providing incentives for increasing profit, capital efficiency and cash generation."
"Incentives are also provided for 
driving the Company‘s digital transformation and developing its sustainability-related business."
"In addition, sustainability – as a strategic goal and an expression of Siemens’ social responsibility – is a high priority at 
Siemens."
Sustainability is managed using the DEGREE framework.
"Introduced in fiscal 2021, this framework addresses 
sustainability from every angle and determines Siemens’ ambitions in the sustainability area with systematized, measurable 
and specific long-term targets for environment, social and governance (ESG) dimensions."
"DEGREE is an acronym that stands 
for decarbonization, ethics, governance, resource efficiency, equity and employability."
"The DEGREE framework is 
continuously developed and adapted to the commitments that Siemens has made, such as the Science Based Targets 
initiative."
"The key performance indicators applied in long-term variable compensation are part of this DEGREE framework 
(CO2 emissions and digital learning hours per employee) and/or reflect the Company’s priorities (Net Promoter Score as an 
expression of customer satisfaction)."
Fiscal 2023 was another very successful year for Siemens.
"We raised our outlook during the fiscal year after the 
first and the second quarters."
We then reached or exceeded all the targets set for our primary measures for fiscal 2023.
"Revenue was higher in nearly all our industrial businesses and rose to €77.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year."
"Smart 
Infrastructure and Digital Industries contributed double-digit growth with all businesses posting increases."
"Excluding 
currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens rose 11%."
"Profit Industrial Business exceeded the record 
high of a year earlier and rose 11% to €11.4 billion."
"The profit margin of our Industrial Business rose to 15.4%, up from 
15.1% a year earlier, reaching its highest level ever."
"Net income nearly doubled year-over year to a historic high of €8.5 billion and corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) 
more than doubled to €10.04."
Earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA) increased to €10.77.
"Return on capital employed (ROCE) for fiscal 2023 rose to 18.6%, up from 10.0% in fiscal 2022."
"This increase was due to 
sharply higher income before interest after tax year-over-year."
"We thus exceeded the forecast for ROCE, which was to come 
close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%."
"Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2023 was €10.0 billion, reaching a record high."
"The 
cash conversion rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net

→

"Fiscal 2023 in retrospect

income, was 1.17."
"We thus achieved a cash conversion rate that contributed strongly to the average required to reach our 
target of 1 minus annual comparable revenue growth rate over a cycle of three to five years."
"Siemens’ strong operating performance in fiscal 2023 is reflected in the Managing Board’s variable compensation, which 
takes into account not only financial success but also environmental and social aspects."
"As a result, the compensation of 
the Managing Board members is also oriented toward the interests of the shareholders as well as the other stakeholders of 
Siemens AG."
"Composition of the Managing Board and the Compensation Committee 
There were no changes in the composition of the Managing Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2023."
"In fiscal 2023, the Managing 
Board comprised Dr. Roland Busch (President and CEO), Cedrik Neike, Matthias Rebellius, Prof. Dr. Ralf P."
"Thomas and 
Judith Wiese."
"Grazia 
Vittadini has been a new member of the Compensation Committee since February 2023."
"As of September 30, 2023, the 
Compensation Committee comprised Matthias Zachert (Chairman), Harald Kern, Jürgen Kerner, Jim Hagemann Snabe, 
Birgit Steinborn and Grazia Vittadini."
1 and 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).
"The Compensation Report on the compensation individually 
awarded and due to the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2022 was 
approved by a majority of 92.09% of the valid votes cast at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on February 9, 2023."
"In view of the high level of approval, the Compensation Report for 2023 is basically unchanged in structure and scope."
"In 
addition, no changes to the compensation system were deemed necessary for fiscal 2023."
"Pursuant to Section 120a para.1 
sent."
"1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the compensation system for Managing Board members must be 
submitted for regular approval by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in February 2024."
"In this connection, the compensation 
system has been subjected to a comprehensive review and adjusted."
"The compensation system as of fiscal 2024 is available 
on the Company website as part of the Notice of Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."

The compensation of the Managing Board members consists of fixed and variable components.
"Fixed compensation, which 
is not performance-based, comprises base salary, fringe benefits and a pension benefit commitment."
"Short-term variable 
compensation (Bonus) and long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) are performance-based compensation and 
thus variable."
The Share Ownership Guidelines are a further key component of the compensation system.
"They obligate Managing Board 
members to permanently hold Siemens shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to purchase additional 
shares in the event that the value of their shares falls below the defined amount."
"The Managing Board compensation system is also supplemented by commitments granted in connection with the 
commencement and termination of appointments to the Managing Board as well as any change in the regular place of 
work."

"Compared to the companies in the STOXX Europe 50, which is also 
used for a market comparison due to Siemens’ international footprint, direct target compensation was actually below the 
customary market range."
"Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board approved an increase in the total target 
compensation of all Managing Board members as of October 1, 2022."
"This increase was implemented by raising the 
individual members’ Stock Awards target amounts."
"The Stock Awards target amount for Dr. Roland Busch was raised to 
€3,340,000 from €2,954,000, the target amount for Prof. Dr. Ralf P."
"Thomas was raised to €2,145,000 from €2,000,000, 
the target amount for Cedrik Neike was raised to €1,470,000 from €1,259,000, and the target amounts for the remaining 
Managing Board members were raised to €1,380,000 from €1,259,000."
"Due to the increase in the Stock Awards target amounts, variable compensation is structured on a more long-term basis, 
while compensation as a whole is oriented even more toward sustainable Company development."
"Regarding compensation, all components of the compensation of the position of President and CEO are differentiated."
"The 
target amount of Prof. Dr. Ralf P."
Thomas’s Stock Awards is differentiated due to his particular responsibilities as CFO.
"The 
target amount of Cedrik Neike’s Stock Awards is also differentiated due to the outstanding business results of Digital 
Industries, the strategic importance of this Business for the further development of Siemens AG and Cedrik Neike’s five-
years of membership on the Managing Board."

B.2.2 Maximum compensation 
The maximum compensation of each Managing Board member is determined annually by the Supervisory Board in 
accordance with Section 87a para."
1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).
"Maximum compensation is 
equal to the total of the maximum amounts of all compensation components that can possibly be paid out to each 
Managing Board member for the relevant fiscal year."
"It is calculated by adding base salary, maximum fringe benefits and 
the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) as well as two times the Bonus target amount and three times the 
Stock Awards target amount."
"Twice the Bonus target amount and triple the Stock Awards target amount also correspond 
to the respective limits (individual caps) on the amount of variable compensation."

"In no case did the fringe

"The Bonus cap was 
not reached in fiscal 2023."
"Since the 2023 Stock Awards tranche is not due until November 2026, compliance with the maximum limit of the Stock 
Awards for fiscal 2023 can be finally assessed only in November 2026, when the 2023 Stock Awards tranche is settled."
"The final assessment of compliance with the maximum compensation for fiscal 2023 will be included in the Compensation 
Report for fiscal 2027."
"B.2.3 Appropriateness of compensation 
The Supervisory Board conducted the annual review of Managing Board compensation in order to determine the latter’s 
appropriateness and conformity with market conditions."
"For this purpose, the Supervisory Board assessed the 
compensation’s level and structure relative to the companies included in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, 
and relative to the companies included in the STOXX Europe 50 (horizontal comparison)."
"In the course of its review, the 
Supervisory Board also assessed the development of Managing Board compensation relative to the compensation of Senior 
Management and Siemens’ total workforce in Germany (vertical comparison)."
"Senior Management comprises executive 
employees."
"The total workforce comprises Senior Management as well as the Siemens employees who are covered by 
collective bargaining agreements and those who are not."
"In addition to a status quo analysis, the vertical comparison took 
into account the development of compensation ratios over time."
"Since Siemens Healthineers is a separately managed, 
publicly listed company, its workforce was not included in the vertical comparison."
"The appropriateness review of Managing Board compensation for fiscal 2023 has shown that Managing Board 
compensation is appropriate."

B.3 Variable compensation in fiscal 2023 
Variable compensation is tied to performance and accounts for a significant proportion of the total compensation of 
Managing Board members."
"It consists of a short-term variable component (Bonus) and a long-term variable component 
(Stock Awards)."
"The performance criteria and the key performance indicators used to measure performance for variable compensation in 
fiscal 2023 are derived from the Company’s strategic goals and operational steering and are in line with the compensation 
system applicable for fiscal 2023."
"As a rule, all the performance criteria measure successful value creation in all its different 
forms, as strategically envisioned."
"In line with Siemens’ social responsibility, sustainability is also included in the 
performance criteria."
"The performance criteria relevant for fiscal 2023, the key performance indicators, the focus topics and the explanations of 
how these foster the Company’s long-term development are shown in the following table."
"This key performance indicator provides a comprehensive perspective that 
encompasses all units of the Siemens Group."
"The consideration of EPS pre PPA 
strengthens the focus on Siemens’ operating performance."
"The adjustment 
of ROCE places the focus on Siemens’ operating performance."

The Supervisory Board aims to ensure that the targets for variable compensation are demanding and sustainable."
"If they 
are not reached, variable compensation can be reduced to zero."
"If the targets are significantly exceeded, target achievement 
is capped at 200%."
"One financial performance criterion is assigned to the “Siemens Group” 
dimension and another to the “Managing Board portfolio” dimension."
"The fulfillment of these criteria is measured on the 
basis of key performance indicators."
"Within the “Individual targets” dimension, the financial performance criteria “growth” 
and “liquidity” can be employed as can additional, non-financial performance criteria."
"In the case of non-financial 
performance criteria, the Supervisory Board considers the degree to which a Managing Board member has fulfilled so-called 
focus topics, which comprise operations-related aspects of the execution of the Company’s strategy as well as sustainability-
related aspects."
"At the end of the fiscal year, target achievement for the individual key performance indicators and the achievement of the 
Managing Board members’ individual targets are determined and aggregated to form a weighted average."
"The percentage 
of weighted target achievement multiplied by the individual target amount yields the Bonus payout amount for the past 
fiscal year."
"The payable Bonus is capped at two times the target amount and is paid in cash, at the latest, together with the 
compensation paid at the end of February of the following fiscal year."
"For this reason, 
“profit” is measured in terms of basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA)."
"EPS pre PPA is 
defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business 
combinations and related income taxes."
It includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG.
"To take account of the Company’s long-term performance and provide incentives for a sustainable increase in profit, the 
average EPS pre PPA of three consecutive fiscal years was used for target setting."
"The portfolio of Siemens AG changed 
significantly due to the spin-off of Siemens Energy at the end of fiscal 2020."
"Against this backdrop, target setting for fiscal 
2023 was defined on the basis of comparable EPS pre PPA values."
"The following EPS pre PPA values were used for this 
purpose: the EPS pre PPA value of continuing operations was used for fiscal 2020, and the EPS pre PPA values of continuing 
and discontinued operations were used for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022."

“Individual targets” target dimension 
The “Individual targets” target dimension comprises four equally weighted individual targets, achievement of each of which 
may be between 0% and 200%."
The cash conversion rate (CCR) was defined as the first individual target for all Managing Board members.
"The CCR reflects 
a company’s ability to convert profit into available cash."
"For the President and CEO and the Managing Board members with 
primarily functional responsibility, the CCR target was defined on the basis of the Siemens Group in order to support 
Siemens’ voluntary commitment to generate cash at Group level."
"CCR Siemens Group is defined as the ratio of free cash 
flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net income."
"For the Managing Board members with business 
responsibility for Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, the CCR targets are business-specific and defined as the ratio 
of free cash flow to profit at each business."
The target amounts for CCR were based on the budget plans.
"In addition to CCR, “comparable revenue growth” was defined as the second individual target for fiscal 2023 for all members 
of the Managing Board."
"It indicates the development in Siemens’ business net of currency translation effects arising from 
the external environment outside of Siemens’ control and the portfolio effects that involve business activities that are either 
new to or no longer a part of the relevant business."
"For the President and CEO and the members of the Managing Board 
with primarily functional responsibility, the growth target was determined on the basis of continuing operations (c/o) 
related to the Siemens Group (Siemens c/o)."
"For the Managing Board members with business responsibility for Digital 
Industries and Smart Infrastructure, growth targets are based on their respective businesses."

Total target achievement for the Bonus for fiscal 2023 
Total target achievement and the resulting Bonus payout amount for each Managing Board member are summarized in the 
following table."
"B.3.2 Long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) 
B.3.2.1."
"BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING 
Siemens grants long-term variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards."
"A Stock Award is the claim to one share – 
conditional on target achievement – after the expiration of a defined vesting period."
"The vesting period is, accordingly, the 
term of each Stock Awards tranche."
"At the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on 100% target achievement 
for each Managing Board member."
"This target amount is extrapolated to target achievement of 200% (“maximum allocation 
amount”)."
Stock Awards for this maximum allocation amount are then allocated to the Managing Board members.
"The 
number of Stock Awards is calculated by dividing the maximum allocation amount by the price of the Siemens share on the 
allocation date, less the estimated discounted dividends (“allocation price”)."
"An approximately four-year vesting period begins with the allocation of Stock Awards, after the expiration of which Siemens 
shares are transferred."
The beneficiary Managing Board members are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
"Total shareholder return – TSR is indicative of the performance of one share over a specified period of time – in the case of 
Siemens, over the approximately four-year vesting period."
"It takes into account changes in the share price and the dividends 
paid during this period."
"To reflect the Company’s international footprint, the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of 
the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index, the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index."
"Target achievement for TSR is concretely determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR 
reference value for the sector index."
"The TSR reference value is equal to the average of the end-of-month values over the 
first 12 months of the vesting period (reference period)."
"In order to determine at the end of the vesting period how well the TSR of Siemens AG has performed relative to the TSR of 
the sector index, the TSR performance value is calculated over the subsequent 36 months (performance period)."
"The TSR 
performance value is the average of the end-of-month values during the performance period."

"Compensation of Managing Board members

At the end of the vesting period, the change in Siemens’ TSR as well as that of the sector index is determined by comparing 
the TSR reference values with the TSR performance values."
The following applies for the determination of target achievement.
"Environment, social and governance – The Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is based on three equally weighted, 
structured and verifiable ESG key performance indicators."
"At the beginning of each tranche, the Supervisory Board defines 
the target values for each of the ESG key performance indicators."
"Target measurement is based on defined interim targets 
for each fiscal year."
"Target achievement for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is finally determined at the end 
of the approximately four-year vesting period on the basis of the weighted average of the target achievement values 
calculated for each of the key performance indicators."
"Determination of total target achievement 
At the end of the approximately four-year vesting period, the Supervisory Board determines the degree of target 
achievement."
"The target achievement range for TSR and for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is between 0% 
and 200%."
"If target achievement is less than 200%, a number of Siemens Stock Awards equivalent to the shortfall are 
forfeited without refund or replacement and a correspondingly smaller number of shares is transferred."
"The value of the Siemens shares transferred after the expiration of the vesting period is also capped at 300% of the target 
amount."
"If this cap is exceeded, a corresponding number of Stock Awards is forfeited without refund or replacement."
"• If the change in the TSR of Siemens AG is equal to
that of the sector index, target achievement is 100%."
"• If the change in the TSR of Siemens AG is at least
20 percentage points below that of the sector index,
target achievement is 0%."
"If the change in the TSR of Siemens AG is between
20 percentage points above and 20 percentage points
below that of the sector index, target achievement is
calculated using linear interpolation."

The remaining number of Stock Awards is settled by the transfer of Siemens shares to the relevant Managing Board member."

on the Company’s strategic sustainability planning, which is described in detail in Siemens’ sustainability reporting."
"Sustainability

our day-to-day working environment while continuously 
increasing learning hours."

The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters."
Customers that rate Siemens high on the scale are promoters.
Customers that find it unlikely to recommend Siemens to others are named detractors.
Example: promoters (55%) minus detractors (10%) = NPS (45%).
"The Supervisory Board set the allocation date for the 2023 Stock Awards tranche at November 18, 2022."
"The timeline of 
this tranche is as follows."
"The target amounts, the maximum allocation amounts, the maximum number of Stock Awards allocated and the fair value

"The Bonus is reported under “Short-term variable compensation” as “due compensation” since the underlying services were 
fully rendered by the end of each period (September 30)."
"Therefore, the Bonus payout amounts for the reporting year are

comprehensible and in order to guarantee a connection between performance and compensation in the reporting period."
"Furthermore, in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Stock Awards from the 2019 and 2018 tranches allocated in fiscal 2019

"The compensation

"Comparative information on profit development 
and annual change in compensation 
The following table shows, in accordance with Section 162 para."
"2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), 
Siemens’ profit development, the annual change in the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members’ compensation 
and the annual change in average employee compensation on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five fiscal years."
"Profit development is presented on the basis of the Siemens Group’s key performance indicators revenue, comparable 
revenue growth and basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations."
"Through fiscal 2021, the latter 
was also one of the financial targets for the short-term variable compensation (Bonus) of the Managing Board and thus had 
a significant influence on the amount of the compensation of the Managing Board members."
"Since fiscal 2022, the 
comparative information has also included basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation."
"This key performance 
indicator supersedes basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations in the Bonus in accordance with 
the Siemens Financial Framework, which has been in effect since fiscal 2022."
In accordance with Section 275 para.
"16 
of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB), the development of the net income of Siemens AG is also 
shown."
"The compensation awarded and due to the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members in each fiscal year is presented 
in accordance with Section 162 para."
1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).
"Pension payments to former 
members of the Managing Board are not listed here since they do not depend on Siemens‘ profit development."
"The presentation of average employee compensation is based on the size of the workforce, including trainees, employed 
by Siemens in Germany."
"In fiscal 2023, this workforce comprised on average 70,984 employees (full-time equivalent)."
"By 
way of comparison, the Siemens Group had about 254,000 employees and trainees worldwide as of September 30, 2023."
"The figures exclude the workforce of Siemens Healthineers, which is not included in the presentation since it is a separately 
managed, publicly listed company."
"Average employee compensation comprises the personnel costs for wages and salaries, fringe benefits, employer 
contributions to social insurance and any short-term variable compensation components attributable to the fiscal year."
"For 
compensation in connection with share plans, the amounts received in the fiscal year are taken into account."
"Therefore, 
employee compensation is also equivalent, in principle, to awarded and due compensation within the meaning of 
Section 162 para."

"Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board 
Management and the Supervisory Board of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the preparation of the

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Compensation Report and the related disclosures based on our audit."
"We 
conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated 
by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Those standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Compensation 
Report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the Compensation Report and the 
related disclosures."
"The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error."
"An audit also includes evaluating 
the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory 
Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures."
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
"Opinion 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the Compensation Report for the fiscal year from 
October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 and the related disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial 
reporting provisions of Sec."

"The Company also made major invest-
ments to drive its innovative power and enhance its 
manufacturing capacities – while further strengthening 
its regional diversification."
"Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board focused 
intensively in fiscal 2023 on the execution of Siemens’ 
growth strategy."
"Siemens Xcelerator, our open digital 
business platform, gained more and more momentum 
and is the key element of Siemens’ strategy to combine 
the real and the digital worlds."
"The business opportunities 
created by ­
digitalization and sustainability as well as the 
DEGREE sustainability framework were likewise priorities."
"In ­
addition, the elections at the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting enabled the Supervisory Board to successfully 
further develop its own profile of skills and expertise, 
particularly in the areas of technology and sustainability."
"Today, our Supervisory Board is more global and more 
diverse than ever before – and, as a result, excellently 
positioned to optimally support the Company also in the 
next phases of its development."
"In fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board performed in full 
the duties assigned to it by law, the Siemens Articles 
of Association and the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board."
"On the basis of detailed written and oral reports provided 
by the Managing Board, we monitored the Managing 
Board and advised it on the management of the Company."
"In my capacity as Chairman of the Super­
visory Board, 
I regularly exchanged information with the ­
President and 
Chief Executive Officer and other Managing Board mem-
bers."
"As a result, the Supervisory Board was always 
kept up to date on projected business policies, Company 
­
planning – including financial, investment and personnel 
planning – and the Company’s profitability and business 
operations as well as on the state of Siemens AG and the 
Siemens Group."
"We were directly involved at an early 
stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to the 
Company and discussed these decisions with the Man-
aging Board intensively and in detail."
"A special focus of our activities in fiscal 2023 was the fur-
ther implementation of the Company’s growth strategy."
"At our meetings and in additional informational sessions, 
we concerned ourselves intensively with the goals and 
priorities of Siemens’ businesses and with the Managing 
Board’s technology and personnel strategy."
"In this connec-
tion, we focused our attention on the accelerated trans-
formation toward digitalization and sustainability and on 
business and technological innovation and the related 
opportunities for growth."
"Together with the Managing 
Board, we discussed markets, trends and growth fields."
"A 
further focus of our activities in fiscal 2023 – in addition to 
Siemens Xcelerator, our platform for driving the digital 
transformation – was Siemens AG’s sustainability ­
strategy."
"We focused on s­
ustainability-related topics in the environ-
ment, social and governance (ESG) area."
"At the center was 
not only DEGREE, our Companywide sustainability frame-
work – with the aspects of decarbonization, ethics, gover-
nance, resource efficiency, equity and employability – but 
also the positive impact the Company creates for customers 
with its port­
folio."

and opportunities for the Company connected with social 
and environmental factors as well as the environmental 
and social impact of the Company’s activities."

portunities for the Company connected with social and en-
vironmental factors as well as the environmental and social 
impact of the Company’s activities."
"The Supervisory Board

"Topics at the plenary meetings of the 
Supervisory Board
We held a total of six regular plenary meetings in fiscal 
2023."
"We also held an extraordinary constituent meeting 
of the Supervisory Board immediately after the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting on February 9, 2023."
"Six meetings 
were held in person and one in a so-called hybrid format – 
that is, as an in-person meeting with the possibility of 
­
virtual participation."
"No meetings were held via telephone 
conference or in an exclusively virtual format."
"We also 
made one decision using other customary forms of com-
munication."
"In addition, we concerned ourselves, as occasion required, 
with acquisition and divestment projects and with risks to 
the Company."
"In addition, we 
regularly met in sessions without the Managing Board in 
attendance."
"In these closed sessions, we dealt with agenda 
items that concerned either the Managing Board itself or 
internal Supervisory Board matters."

Board reported to us on the Company’s current business

firmed the appropriateness of this compensation."
"We 
had already defined the performance criteria for the Man-
aging Board’s variable compensation for fiscal 2023 at our 
meeting on September 23, 2022."
"On this basis and on a 
recommendation by the Compensation Committee, we 
made a decision regarding target setting for Managing 
Board compensation for fiscal 2023 at our meeting on 
­
November 16, 2022."
"At this meeting, we also  approved

fiscal 2022 and 
endorsed a decision by the Managing Board regarding 
­
financing measures."

the basis of recommendations by the Nomi­
nating Com-
mittee, we concerned ourselves with proposals regarding

tives and seven shareholder representatives on the 
­
Supervisory Board, a constituent meeting of the Super-
visory Board was held immediately after the Annual

"At this meet-
ing, the Supervisory Board confirmed Birgit ­
Steinborn 
as the Supervisory Board’s First Deputy Chairwoman and 
Dr. Werner Brandt as the Supervisory Board’s Second 
Deputy Chairman, effective the beginning of their re-
spective new electoral periods."

to consider and discuss in detail topics of strategic 
­

neers and about progress in the integration of Varian."

selves with the Company’s strategic orientation and with

discussed the Company’s business opportunities con-
nected with sustainability-related factors and concerned

eas of decarbonization, energy efficiency and resource

also topics of our discussions."
"In addition, we discussed 
the Siemens Energy investment and the format of the

with Managing Board compensation and approved a pro-
posal regarding the engagement of the auditors of the

"At the meeting, the Managing

"The person-
nel strategy of Siemens AG was again a focus of the meet-
ing."
"Following up on its reporting on December 7, 2022, 
the Managing Board informed us about the strategic 
­
approach to systematic workforce training, which aimed 
to drive the organization’s transformation and empower 
its employees to continuously learn and grow."

cussed the Managing Board’s considerations regarding the

ing Board compensation, whose appropriateness had

tee, we approved an adjustment of the compensation

"Sustainability is one of the 
focus topics of the Supervisory Board’s work."
"Sustain­
ability is of such central importance for Siemens that it 
is discussed regularly and in detail at the Supervisory 
Board’s plenary meetings."
"As a cross-cutting issue, 
­
sustainability touches on the areas of responsibility of 
several committees."

sustainability-related questions in detail and reports on 
these matters at the Supervisory Board’s plenary meet­

of external consultants  – in order to determine how 
­
efficiently they perform their duties."
"In fiscal 2023, the 
Supervisory Board conducted an internal self-assess­
ment."

it."

this ­
requirement."

quirement, the consideration of women is an essential 
aspect of the Supervisory Board’s long-term succession 
planning for the Managing Board."

Managing Board takes diversity into account and, in partic­
ular, aims for an appropriate consideration of women and 
internationality."

­
German legal requirements set out in Section 76 para."
"On the basis of projected 
employee figures, women will, accordingly, hold a total 
of four of the 13 positions at Siemens AG at the first 
­
management level below the Managing Board and a 
t­
otal of 32 of the 126 positions at Siemens AG at the 
­
second management level below the Managing Board."
"For the Siemens Group worldwide, the targets set out in 
the Companywide DEGREE sustainability framework 
continue to apply without change."
"The composition of the Supervisory Board fulfilled the 
­
legal requirements regarding the minimum gender quota 
in the reporting period."
"Statutory provisions on the equal participation of men and 
women in management positions that may be applicable to 
Group companies other than Siemens AG remain unaffected."
"Diversity with respect to such charac­
teristics as age and gender as well as professional and 
educational background is an important selection cri­
terion for appointments to Managing Board positions."
"As a group, the Managing Board shall have experi­
ence in the business areas that are important for 
Siemens – in particular, in the industry, infrastruc­
ture, energy, mobility and healthcare sectors."
Diversity also means gender diversity.
"According to 
the legal requirement applicable to Siemens AG 
(Section 76 para."
"3a of the German Stock Corpora­
tion Act), the Managing Board must include at least 
one woman and at least one man (minimum partic­
ipation requirement)."

visory Board has defined an age limit for the mem­
bers of the Managing Board."

limit, the members of the Managing Board are, as 
a rule, to be not older than 67 years of age."

and / or making proposals for the appointment of Manag­
ing Board members, the Supervisory Board and / or the 
Chairman’s Committee of the Supervisory Board take into 
account the requirements defined in the diversity con­
cept for the Managing Board."
"In its current composition, the Managing Board fulfills all 
the requirements of the diversity concept."
"The Managing 
Board members have a broad range of knowledge, expe­
rience and educational and professional backgrounds as 
well as international experience."

for the Managing Board
Jointly with the Managing Board and with the support of 
the Chairman’s Committee, the Supervisory Board con­
ducts long-term succession planning for the Managing 
Board."

based on the strategic target setting of the Company."
"Taking into account the concrete qualification require­
ments and the diversity concept that the Supervisory 
Board has approved for the Managing Board’s compo­
sition, the Chairman’s Committee prepares ideal profiles."
"When a concrete decision regarding succession is to be 
made, the Chairman’s Committee compiles a shortlist of 
the available candidates on the basis of these profiles."
"Structured interviews are then conducted with these 
­
candidates."
"After the interviews, a recommendation is 
submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval."
"When 
developing the profile of requirements and selecting 
­
candidates, the Supervisory Board and / or the Chairman’s

shall be performed to determine which of the areas 
of expertise deemed desirable for the Supervisory 
Board are to be strengthened."

Taking the Company’s international orientation into 
account, care shall be taken to ensure that the Super­

grounds, experiences and ways of thinking are also to 
be promoted."
