"Despite 
numerous successes, the year was marked above all by an unsatis-
factory share price."
"The Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Trans-
formation of Industry Business Areas met or exceeded their targets."
"Strong orders, reflecting the increased demand for energy transition 
technologies, was accompanied by a significant increase in revenue, 
supported by the consistent execution of the high order backlog."
"As a 
result of our operational improvements, we have significantly improved 
the margin in these businesses."
"The quality of our products, our global 
reach and the commitment of our employees are the basis to capitalize 
on the opportunities in the energy market together with our customers."
"On the other hand, we clearly fell short of our goal of returning the 
wind business to profitability by integrating it into Siemens Energy."
"Our 
company suffered an unexpected and severe setback in the past fiscal 
year at Siemens Gamesa."
"This had a serious impact on our overall 
results and thus also on our share price."
"The transaction had started as 
planned."
"In May 2022, we announced a voluntary cash tender offer to 
acquire the outstanding shares of Siemens Gamesa to delist the com-
pany and gradually integrate it into Siemens Energy."
"Siemens Gamesa's 
shareholders approved the offer at an Extraordinary General Meeting 
on 
January 25, 2023."
"The 
delisting 
became 
effective 
on 
February 14, 2023."
"Today, Siemens Energy is the sole owner of 
Siemens Gamesa."
"However, in the summer of 2023, serious quality 
problems emerged in parts of the onshore fleet coupled with higher 
product costs and challenges in ramping up the offshore business, that 
led to a material negative impact on the company’s earnings."
"To address 
the quality issues with the 4.X and 5.X onshore platforms, we set up a 
task force staffed with experts, both internal and external to 
Siemens Energy."
"The task force has developed a corrective action plan, 
which is now being systematically implemented."
"We remain convinced 
that wind energy will be an attractive business in the medium term."
"Our business opportunities as an energy technology company are 
excellent."
"After all, the world's energy infrastructure needs to undergo 
a fundamental transformation."
"Only then will humanity be able to meet 
the growing challenges of climate change and rising energy demand."
"We firmly believe that Siemens Energy can and will benefit from this 
transformation."
"An important prerequisite is that each business 
contributes to our mid-term profitability target."
"In fiscal year 2023, the excellent performance of the majority of 
Siemens Energy’s businesses was overshadowed by the unsatisfactory 
performance in the wind business."
"Gas Services, Grid Technologies and 
Transformation of Industry showed an excellent performance through-
out the fiscal year, characterized by strong orders, successful project 
execution and operational improvements leading to increased profita-
bility 
in 
these 
business 
areas."
"All 
businesses, 
except 
for 
Siemens Gamesa, either met or exceeded their full year guidance as 
announced at the beginning of the year."
"Siemens Energy met its full-year guidance for fiscal 2023, which was 
adjusted in the third quarter."
"Orders exceeded the high level of the prior 
fiscal year by 33.8% on a comparable basis and rose to €50.4 billion 
(2022: €38.3 billion)."
"The order backlog at the end of the year was at a 
record level of €112 billion (2022: €97 billion)."
"Revenue of €31.1 billi-
on was up by 9.9% on a comparable basis."
"Siemens Energy’s Profit 
before special items decreased to negative €2,776 million (2022: posi-
tive €225 million) due to the loss at Siemens Gamesa."
"Special items 
amounted to negative €184 million (2022: negative €413 million) 
largely related to restructuring costs at Siemens Gamesa and costs in 
connection with the integration of Siemens Gamesa."
"Profit for 
Siemens Energy came in at negative €2,960 million (2022: negative 
€188 million)."
"Net loss of Siemens Energy was €4,588 million 
(2022: €712 million)."
"Corresponding EPS were negative at €5.47 
(2022: negative €0.65)."
"Free cash flow pre tax decreased to 
€784 million (2022: €1,503 million)."
"For Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2024, we expect comparable revenue 
growth in a range of 3% to 7% and a Profit margin before special items 
between negative 2% and positive 1%."
"Furthermore, we expect a Net 
income of up to €1bn including impacts from disposals and the 
acceleration of the portfolio transformation."
"Free cash flow pre tax is 
expected to be around negative €1.0 billion."
"We expect proceeds in a 
range of positive €2.5 billion to €3.0 billion from disposals and the 
acceleration of the portfolio transformation."
"A difficult geopolitical environment and the resulting increase in 
volatility will remain the new “normal” in the future."
"Siemens Energy 
must prepare for this by further focusing its portfolio, innovating new 
products, diversifying its supply chains, streamlining processes, and 
focusing on data and digitalization."
"The global energy transition is just 
beginning."
We have a lot of work ahead of us.
"We are in an excellent 
position, thanks in large part to our 94,000 employees in more than 90 
countries, who are dedicated and passionate about the challenges of 
transformation."
"They are all working hard to ensure that we at 
Siemens Energy will see far more light than shadow in the future."
"I am 
delighted that you are with us on this journey and thank you for your 
trust."

performance, mainly group management costs (management and 
corporate functions) and other central items, Treasury activities as well 
as eliminations."
"Other central items include Siemens brand fees, 
corporate services (e.g., management of the Group’s real estate 
portfolio (except Siemens Gamesa), which was allocated to the GP 
segment in the prior year), corporate projects, centrally held equity 
interests and other items."
"For further information, see Note 25 
Segment information in 3.6 Notes to Consolidated Financial State-
ments."
Siemens Energy supports its customers around the globe.
"2.1.2 Business model 
Siemens Energy is active along the entire energy technology and 
service value chain with comprehensive and differentiated products, 
solutions and service offerings."
"Our broad product portfolio, comprising efficient conventional as well 
as renewable energies, enables us to meet the increasing demand for 
energy and support efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the 
same time."
"We also offer digital business and intelligent service models 
to our customers."
"Therefore, we consider ourselves well positioned to 
shape the energy transition toward decarbonized energy technologies 
and promptly react to customer needs worldwide thanks to our global 
footprint."
"As already communicated in November 2020, Siemens Energy no 
longer participates in new tenders for pure coal-fired power plants."
"Siemens Energy will still fulfill existing commitments for coal-fired 
power plant projects, including binding offers submitted at the time of 
this decision."
"Also continued are the carbon-reducing service and 
solutions businesses, as well as combined heat and power (CHP) 
projects."
"A significant share of our business is executed via high-volume projects 
and characterized by multi-year customer orders, especially in our 
service and solutions businesses."
"While orders for large projects may 
lead to volatility in order intake from one reporting period to the next, 
revenue is generally less affected by such volatility."
"Large projects 
typically have longer development and construction phases."
"This, 
coupled with our often long-term service contracts, leads to stable and 
recurring revenue recognition over several reporting periods."
"Hence, 
our order backlog gives us a high degree of transparency regarding 
future revenues."
Our profitability level differs among our portfolio elements.
"Therefore, 
our results of operations are affected by the portfolio mix sold in each 
segment."
"Our service business typically has higher margins than the 
product and solutions businesses."
"Hence, our results of operations and 
margins depend on our ability to generate revenue from servicing our 
large installed fleet as it becomes subject to wear and tear, in particular 
the rotating equipment."
"We aim to maintain and expand the long 
lifespan of our installed fleet to secure orders for service contracts, 
primarily focusing on long-term service programs."
"Therefore, we see the service business as a major pillar of the 
sustainable business success of Siemens Energy and are seeking to 
enlarge and leverage this further in the future."
"Gas Services 
The Gas Services Business Area consolidates all the business activities 
relating to gas and large steam turbines, large generators, and heat 
pumps, as well as the associated control technology."
"The GS portfolio 
includes products, solutions, and services for central and distributed 
power generation."
"The business is focused on servicing the installed 
fleet of gas and steam turbines."
"The wide-ranging service portfolio 
includes 
maintenance, 
performance 
enhancements, 
operation 
services, digitalization, and professional consulting."
"GS supports a broad spectrum of customers: utilities, independent po-
wer producers, municipal energy producers, EPC (engineering, procure-
ment, and construction) companies, industrial customers, and cus-
tomers in the oil and gas industry."
"Reliable, efficient, and low-emission turbines enable the integration of 
renewable energy into grids by delivering the base load and/or supple-
menting the fluctuating supplies from renewable energy sources."
"GS is 
contributing to the decarbonization of power generation, thus support-
ting the achievement of its customers’ net zero targets."
"To this end, 
individual gas turbines are being equipped with greater capabilities to 
use hydrogen and green fuels simultaneously (current levels already as 
high as 75%)."
"Moreover, the portfolio includes further measures for 
reducing emissions from gas turbines and power plants by as much as 
100%, e.g., through partnerships for carbon separation solutions."
"Heat 
Combined Management Report 10 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
pumps represent another key lever for reducing emissions, contributing 
to the decarbonization of district heating and industrial heat 
generation."
"Competitors to GS include a small number of multinational original 
equipment manufacturers (OEMs), some of which hold strong market 
positions in their home markets."
"Grid Technologies 
The activities of the Grid Technologies Business Area are focused on 
the key market trends of demand growth, electrification, decarboniza-
tion, and digitalization."
"The products, systems, solutions, and services offered by GT overcome 
the challenges arising from the increasing complexity of the grid infra-
structure as a result of integrating renewable energy and the trend 
toward distributed energy generation."
"Due to its extensive technological 
expertise, a global manufacturing network, its own marketing 
organization, and marketing partners, GT is supporting its customers on 
their path to decarbonization."
"Competitors of GT consist mainly of a small number of large multi-
national companies, increasingly joined by smaller, fast-growing 
manufacturers in countries such as China, India, and South Korea."
"The 
Business Area’s activities are focused primarily on reducing energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in industrial processes."
"TI 
is therefore supporting industrial customers in reducing their carbon 
footprint and achieving their individual decarbonization targets."
"Its 
portfolio includes integrated systems and solutions for various process 
industries (e.g., oil and gas, chemicals, petrochemicals, and fibers), as 
well as for the shipping industry."
"TI concentrates on industrializing novel decarbonization technologies 
and has consolidated these activities with a view to achieving industrial 
scaling, especially in respect of hydrogen, Power-to-X, and photo-
voltaics."
"Another key focus is the delivery of integrated industrial decar-
bonization solutions based on electrification and process optimization 
(automation and digitalization)."
"TI develops and supplies products in 
new fields of technology spanning the entire product life cycle, for 
example, heat recovery solutions, compressed air storage, special 
hydrogen compressors, and CO₂ compressors for separating, using, and 
storing carbon."
"Overall, TI is benefiting from the rising demand for carbon-optimized 
energy technologies, the transition toward a hydrogen-based 
economy, as well as the electrification, automation, and digitalization 
of industry."
"Reducing industrial emissions requires investment in 
decarbonization solutions, including electrification and efficiency 
enhancement, in the optimization, improvement, and modification of 
processes, as well as in the reduction and use of volatile emissions."
"TI’s main competitors are a number of OEMs, some of which have a very 
strong position in their home markets, EPC suppliers, as well as entities 
of industrial enterprises and start-ups that focus on clean technologies 
and hydrogen."
"Depending on customer requirements, 
Siemens Gamesa’s scope of involvement may include delivering either 
a full EPC project or, in some cases, just the supply of components for 
wind turbines."
"Siemens Gamesa comprises the Wind Turbines (Onshore 
and Offshore) as well as Operation and Maintenance (Service) business 
fields."
"For global onshore markets, Siemens Gamesa delivers wind turbine 
design, engineering, manufacturing, and installation solutions focused 
mainly on geared technology, which can be adapted to regional and 
local needs."
"Global offshore markets are provided with customer-
specific wind turbine equipment design, manufacturing, and installa-
tion based on direct drive technology."
"In addition, Siemens Gamesa provides services for the operation and 
maintenance of wind farms, including a comprehensive and flexible 
portfolio for the maintenance and optimization of wind turbines, thus 
delivering holistic lifetime care."
"Complete asset management as well as 
technical assistance is provided for Siemens Gamesa’s wind turbines 
and is also being expanded for third-party platforms."
"Siemens Gamesa’s 
primary 
customers 
are 
large 
utilities 
and 
independent power producers, as well as project developers."
"Competi-
tion in wind power differs in the two major market segments."
"In the 
markets for onshore wind farms, competition is leading to ongoing 
concentration – starting from a relatively dispersed supply side with no 
single company currently holding a dominant market share."
"By 
contrast, the markets for offshore wind farms are already served by just 
a few experienced players."
"Consolidation is constantly moving forward 
in both onshore and offshore markets, driven mainly by scale as well as 
technology and market access challenges."
"The share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is widely 
expected to increase continuously."
"However, the growing number of 
auctions for wind power development represent a constant challenge 
for both developers and turbine suppliers."
"Moreover, competition with 
other power sources is putting additional pressure on life-cycle costs."
"To master this challenge, Siemens Gamesa is focusing on innovation, 
productivity, asset management, operational excellence, sustainability, 
and employee development."
"It is also investing in digitalization, which 
is seen as a key differentiator."

Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
2.1.3 Research and development 
In fiscal year 2023, we reported research and development (R&D) 
expenses of €1,123 million (2022: €1,078 million)."
"The resulting R&D 
intensity, defined as the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, was 3.6% 
(2022: 3.7%)."
"Additions 
to 
capitalized 
development 
expenses 
amountted to €190 million in fiscal year 2023 (2022: €193 million)."
"As 
of September 30, 2023, Siemens Energy held approximately 18,700 
granted 
patents 
worldwide 
in 
its 
continuing 
operations 
(2022: around 18,300)."
"In fiscal year 2023, Siemens Energy employed 
an average number of around 4,300 people in the R&D area."
"Our revenue is driven by our ability to deliver innovative products, 
integrated systems, solutions, and services, and to develop deep 
relationships with customers and partner companies."
"We are convinced 
that sustainable economic value is created through continuous 
innovation and that investment in R&D is fundamental to our success."
"Siemens Energy steers the R&D activities based on a clearly defined 
strategy."
"R&D expenses are subject to regular review in line with 
Business Area requirements and may be reallocated."
"We are seeking to 
develop our portfolio with a clear focus on decarbonized energy 
technologies, service, and new growth fields."
"Another key objective is 
improving the leverage of our large service potential and the 
competitiveness of our current products based on strict quality criteria."
"Furthermore, we will enhance our electrolyzer product line to grow 
revenues."
"In the GT business, R&D activities are focused on accelerating the 
development of the SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride)-free blue portfolio, as well 
as digital products, systems, and solutions – including battery energy 
storage – to better support the energy transition."
"The GS business’ R&D 
activities are focused on transitioning to a carbon-neutral portfolio by 
developing new services, distributed power generation applications, 
and carbon-neutral products and solutions."
"To this end, products being 
developed include grid stabilizers, large-scale heat pumps, and hybrid 
solutions."
"In the traditional GS businesses and in the TI business, R&D 
activities are strongly focused on decarbonization to support our 
customers in the changed market environment."
"Here, the main levers 
are increasing the efficiency, availability, and flexibility of the 
equipment used, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including 
increasing the use of hydrogen."
"Siemens Gamesa focuses its R&D 
activities on the technical development of products and production 
processes, with the goal of reducing electricity generation costs and 
facilitating the integration of wind turbines into hybrid solutions."
"Other 
R&D activities are aimed above all at modularizing and standardizing 
the technologies, tools, and processes for the entire wind portfolio, as 
well as at optimizing product costs and the quality of both products and 
manufacturing processes."
"In January 2023, the Siemens Gamesa R&D 
organization was transitioned to a platform-based model that console-
dates the expertise in onshore and offshore technologies and gives the 
product platforms full responsibility for the costs, timing, and quality of 
their products."
"As a result, necessary product quality improvements can 
be implemented quickly and systematically."
"A key milestone was 
achieved in March 2023 with the successful commissioning of the SG 
14-236 DD prototype, an offshore wind turbine that produces up to 
30% more electricity than its predecessor and thus contributes greatly 
to ensuring competitiveness in the growing offshore wind market."
"A number of major projects are evidence of the success of our R&D 
activities in the areas of energy transition and carbon-neutral techno-
logies."
"One example is our collaboration with Danish energy company 
Ørsted to build a commercial production facility for carbon-neutral 
marine fuels in northeastern Sweden."
"The plant, which 
is being built in the Swedish coastal town of Örnsköldsvik, will be able 
to produce up to 50,000 tons of e-methanol per year from renewable 
energy and biogenic carbon dioxide from 2025."
"As a substitute for fossil 
fuels, this can avoid 100,000 tons of carbon emissions in shipping each 
year."
"Moreover, Siemens Energy and French industrial gas company Air 
Liquide have established a joint venture to build and operate a multi-
gigawatt factory for the industrial series production of our electrolysis 
modules (stacks) in Berlin, Germany."
"These stacks are also based on 
PEM electrolysis technology, making them highly efficient and ideal for 
operation with volatile renewable energy."
"The pooled expertise of this 
Franco-German partnership aims to pave the way for establishing a 
sustainable hydrogen economy in Europe and creating a European 
electrolysis and hydrogen technology ecosystem."
"Production began in 
the second half of 2023."
"In accordance with our R&D strategy, we 
allocate our R&D resources selectively towards products and services in 
market growth segments."
"Siemens Energy is intensifying R&D in innovative materials and 
advanced manufacturing methods."
"Innovations focus on product 
digitalization, power electronics, software-driven power control, 
environmentally friendly products and systems, and grid stabilization."
"Additive manufacturing is another of the innovation fields in which 
Siemens Energy has been active for many years."
"As of September 30, 
2023, we can look back on more than 15 years of user experience and 
development cooperation with, among others, Werner-von-Siemens 
Centre for Industry and Science e.V., Göteborg Energi and Equinor."
"Siemens Energy works with other industry participants and research 
institutions to advance research projects."
"Prominent partners include 
the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), DTU Copenhagen, 
the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the Georgia Institute of 
Technology, Khalifa University, the University of Sheffield, AGTurbo, 
and EUTurbines."
"The four global innovation centers in Berlin, Orlando, 
Abu Dhabi, and Shenzhen, whose aim is to nurture innovation and 
accelerate the energy transition, also work with both academic and 
industrial partners within the framework of a partnership model."
"Combined Management Report 12 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
2.2 Financial performance system 
2.2.1 Financial Framework 
Siemens Energy’s Financial Framework includes performance indicators 
(PIs) and targets that we aim to achieve over a three-year period or 
beyond (mid-term)."
The reporting and analysis of PIs are related to our strategic goals.
"The 
PIs are designed to help achieve these goals on an operational level and 
aim to strike a balance between the factors of growth, profitability, and 
liquidity."
"They serve as a measure of target attainment for managers 
and thus can influence Executive Board remuneration."
"The most 
important of these PIs (key performance indicators, KPIs) are forecast 
for the next fiscal year."
"For more details see 2.7 Report on expected 
developments."
"Some of the PIs described below are alternative performance measures 
(APMs), which are not defined or listed in IFRS (non-GAAP measures)."
"We believe that our APMs offer additional and useful information for 
our stakeholders helping them to assess the business performance of 
Siemens Energy."
"Other companies may report similarly named indica-
tors, but they are not always comparable due to possibly different 
calculation methods."
"2.2.2 Growth 
Siemens Energy measures, manages, and controls the development of 
its business volume using comparable growth figures for orders and 
revenue."
"The KPI comparable revenue growth shows the develop-
ment of revenue net of currency translation effects that result from the 
external environment outside of our control and portfolio effects that 
relate to business activities that are either new to our business or no 
longer a part of it."
"Currency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the 
current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period 
and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates 
of the comparative period."
"To calculate the percentage change year-on-
year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparative 
period."
"A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition or a disposal and is 
calculated as the year-on-year change in revenue resulting specifically 
from the transaction."
"To calculate the percentage change, the absolute 
change is divided by revenue for the comparative period."
"At Group level, Siemens Energy focuses on profitable growth and aims 
to achieve a compound annual growth rate for revenue (based on fiscal 
year 2023, excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in the 
mid-single-digit percentage range by fiscal year 2026 and 2028."
"For orders, we apply the same approach to the calculation of currency 
translation and portfolio effects as described above."
"The order backlog 
is calculated by adding the new orders from the current reporting 
period to the order backlog at the end of the previous reporting period 
and then subtracting the revenues realized in the current reporting 
period."
"Direct order value adjustments such as modifications, currency 
translations and portfolio effects are also considered."
"The book-to-bill 
ratio is the ratio of orders to revenue."
"2.2.3 Profitability 
In fiscal year 2023, we used the KPI Profit margin before Special items 
to measure the profitability of operating activities of Siemens Energy, 
replacing our previous KPI Adjusted EBITA margin before Special items."
"To calculate the Profit margin before Special items, Profit before Special 
items is divided by total revenue."
"Profit is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, interest income 
and expenses, and other financial income (expenses), net, adjusted for 
amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
and goodwill impairments."
"To increase comparability year-on-year, we use Profit before Special 
items."
"Special items refer to the following topics: 
• Restructuring and integration costs: Restructuring costs refer to 
personnel measures leading to severance charges, including costs 
for terminating service contracts with Siemens Group (Siemens AG 
and its subsidiaries)."
"Due to the further integration of 
Siemens Gamesa and the objective of a consistent presentation 
within the Group, only personnel-related measures for restructuring 
will be included for Siemens Gamesa from fiscal year 2023, in 
contrast to the past."
"Integration costs that occur at Siemen Gamesa 
are related to the integration of companies as well as in the course 
of the integration of Siemens Gamesa into the Group and the 
corresponding transaction costs."
"• Stand-alone costs relate to the separation from Siemens Group and 
the formation of Siemens Energy as an independent enterprise."
"• Major asset impairments and write-downs (as well as any sub-
sequent reversals) related to strategic portfolio decisions."
"For both Profit margin and Special items, prior year information is 
presented on a comparable basis."
"Profit margin before Special items is one of the targets used in deter-
mining the short-term variable compensation of the Executive Board."
"We aim to achieve a Profit margin for the Group of 5 - 7% for fiscal year 
2026 and at least 8% in the fiscal year 2028."
"For the purposes of managing and controlling profitability at Group le-
vel, we also use Net income as a KPI and aim to achieve Net income of 
€ 1.0 - 1.5 billion for fiscal year 2026."
"This KPI is the main driver of Basic 
earnings per share (Basic EPS), which is defined as net income attribu-
table to shareholders of Siemens Energy AG divided by the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding without any dilution."
"Basic

earnings per share also influence the long-term variable compensation 
of the Executive Board."
"2.2.4 Liquidity 
To provide an assessment of the Group’s ability to generate cash we use 
Free cash flow pre tax as a KPI and aim to achieve a cumulative Free 
cash flow pre tax of € 1.0 - 2.0 billion for fiscal years 2024 to 2026."
"Free 
cash flow pre tax of the Group is defined as cash flows from operating 
activities before income taxes paid, less additions to intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment."
"Free cash flow of the segments 
constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to 
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment."
"It excludes 
financing interest, except for cases where interest on qualifying assets 
is capitalized or classified as contract costs; it also excludes income 
taxes and certain other payments and proceeds."
"Consequently, Free 
cash flow pre tax demonstrates the extent to which we are able to meet 
both recurring and specific cash outflows, such as payments for acquisi-
tions, dividends, debt servicing or taxes, etc."
"Free cash flow pre tax is one of the targets used in determining the 
short-term variable compensation of the Executive Board."
"To provide an assessment of our ability to generate cash, we use the 
operational Cash conversion rate (CCR) as an ancillary measure until 
the end of fiscal year 2023 This is defined as the ratio of Free cash flow 
pre tax to Profit, which has replaced Adjusted EBITA since fiscal 
year 2023."
"According to its financial policy, Siemens Energy aims for a capital 
structure that is in line with an investment grade profile."
"The PI used to 
assess our capital structure is Adjusted net debt/ (net cash), which is 
shown in 2.6.3 Financing and liquidity analysis."
"We also use the ratio 
Adjusted net debt to EBITDA."
"This ratio indicates the approximate 
number of years that would be needed to cover the Adjusted net debt 
through EBITDA."
"The EBITDA measure represents income (loss) before 
income taxes, before financial result and before amortization, 
depreciation and impairments."
"Starting in fiscal year 2023, Receivables 
from and Payables to Siemens Group from financing activities were no 
longer included in calculating Adjusted net debt/ (net cash) due to 
materiality."
"Finally, we aim to provide an attractive return to our shareholders."
"Under the Siemens Energy Financial Framework, our intention is to 
propose a dividend in the mid-term whose distribution volume is 40 to 
60 % of the Group’s Net income attributable to shareholders of 
Siemens Energy AG."
"For this purpose, the Net income may be adjusted 
for extraordinary non-cash effects."
"We will use ROCE to manage our capital efficiency from fiscal 
year 2024."
"ROCE is calculated as operating income (loss) after tax 
divided by average capital employed."
"Average capital employed, as the 
sum of Adjusted net debt and total equity, is defined as a five-point 
average of capital employed at the beginning of the reporting period, 
the respective balances on the quarterly reporting dates and the capital 
employed at the end of the reporting period."
"At Group level, we aim to achieve a ROCE of more than 15% for the 
fiscal year 2028."

2.3 Business performance in fiscal year 2023
2.3.1 Overall assessment by the Executive Board  
of the current 
 
economic situation 
The past fiscal year was a year of light and shadow for Siemens Energy."
"The segments GS, GT and TI delivered an excellent performance."
"Our former Gas and Power businesses achieved or exceeded their targets for the fiscal year and are now well on track to attain their mid-term 
targets."
"Strong order intake reflecting increased market demand was accompanied by significant revenue growth built on the systematic processing 
of the high order backlog."
"Thanks to our operational improvement measures in recent years, we also grew our margins substantially."
"Here, we 
benefited from the quality of our products, our global reach and the opportunities arising from the energy market transformation."
"By contrast, Profit before Special items of the Siemens Gamesa segment was at negative €4.3 billion."
"Therein were charges totaling €2.7 billion 
due to quality issues in particular of the 4.X and 5.X onshore turbines, as well as increased product costs and ramp-up challenges in the offshore 
business."
"We immediately established a Group-wide task force with members from all functions and external experts that has been working flat 
out to resolve the problems and their consequences."
"Although revenue growth was largely unaffected by the problems at Siemens Gamesa, the impact on Profit was considerable, which resulted in a 
clearly negative Profit margin."
This resulted in our inability to achieve the profit guidance we originally issued for Siemens Energy Group.
"Including 
the negative tax effects also associated with Siemens Gamesa, the Net loss in the past fiscal year amounted to €4,588 million."
"The wind power business is essential for a successful global energy transition and is therefore strategically extremely attractive whilst challenging 
operationally."
We are convinced that we can achieve the turnaround at Siemens Gamesa and be successful in this market.
"The strong performance 
of the former Gas and Power businesses gives us confidence in our ability to return business operations to commercial success."
"Notwithstanding 
the resolution of the current problems, we successfully implemented our plan to delist Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
"in the past fiscal 
year."
"Thus, we established a key basis for enabling Siemens Gamesa not only to benefit from close collaboration in day-to-day business operations 
and the corresponding synergies but also to leverage the expertise of the other Business Areas more effectively."
"The current situation at Siemens Gamesa is a great strain on all Siemens Energy employees and, of course, especially on the employees of 
Siemens Gamesa itself."
"It is impressive to see how the entire Siemens Energy team is dealing with the situation and applying their dedication and 
skills to help address the challenges, identifying solutions and implementing measures and this makes us confident to overcome the challenges 
that are ahead of us."
"Siemens Energy’s business performance 
In contrast to the prior year, the business performance in the past fiscal 
year benefited overall from external factors."
"Despite the subdued 
macroeconomic development throughout the year as a whole, the 
market environment for Siemens Energy remained positive due to the 
positive momentum in the energy market."
"Comparatively high energy 
prices and persisting energy security risks continued to drive the 
transformation of the energy market."
"The resulting and growing market 
potential benefited Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2023 and had a 
positive effect on order intake."
"At €50 billion, orders at Siemens Energy increased substantially year-
on-year."
"As a result, the order backlog again exceeded the prior-year 
record to reach €112 billion at the end of the fiscal year."
"Revenue at 
Siemens Energy amounted to €31 billion, increasing clearly on a 
comparable 
basis 
due 
to 
growth 
in 
all 
segments 
except 
Siemens Gamesa."
"Revenue development for the Siemens Energy 
service business was largely in line with the trend for total revenue."
"Profit before Special items at Siemens Energy declined to negative 
€2,776 million from the prior-year value of positive €225 million."
"The 
main reason for this was the loss at Siemens Gamesa, which was largely 
caused by quality issues in particular of the 4.X and 5.X onshore 
turbines and offset the sharply increased Profit of the other segments."
"The negative impacts from Special items declined sharply because, in 
the prior year, there had been considerable impacts from strategic 
portfolio decisions in connection with the restructuring of business 
activities in Russia."
"As a result, the absolute decline in Profit before 
Special items was more substantial than that of Profit."
"Profit for fiscal 
year 2023 was negative €2,960 million, compared with negative 
€188 million in the prior year."
"This resulted in a Net loss for Siemens Energy Group of €4,588 million 
(2022: €712 million) and correspondingly Basic earnings per share of 
negative €5.47."
See 2.4 Results of operation for further information.
"Due to the Net loss and a swing to a negative Other comprehensive 
income, net of income taxes, as well as the acquisition of the out-
standing shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A., Equity 
declined sharply compared to the end of fiscal year 2022."
"For this 
reason, the equity ratio at the end of the past fiscal year amounted to 
18% (2022: 34%)."
"See 2.5 Net assets, liabilities and equity for further 
information."
"Free cash flow pre tax at Siemens Energy was €784 million in the past 
fiscal year, compared with €1,503 million in the prior year."
"A negative 
contribution from Siemens Gamesa played a significant role in this 
development."
"The development of liquidity, substantially influenced by 
the aforementioned acquisition of shares, and the year-on-year in-
crease in debt resulted in adjusted net debt of €759 million at the end 
of fiscal year 2023 (2022: net liquidity of €2,089 million)."
"See 2.6 
Financial position for further information."
"In the course of 
evaluating its installed fleet, Siemens Gamesa identified an unusually 
negative trend in the failure rates of certain components, which led to 
higher assumptions warranty and maintenance costs."
"This had a 
negative 
impact 
on 
profit 
of 
approximately 
€0.5 billion."
"Siemens Gamesa management, therefore, no longer assumed that it 
could achieve profitability in line with the business plan for fiscal 
year 2023, making it necessary to update the profit guidance for 
Siemens Energy."
"Due to the fact that cash flow trended above 
expectations in the first quarter of the fiscal year, buoyed by advance 
payments from customers in connection with the substantial increase 
in orders, the forecast for Free cash flow pre tax was raised."
"On May 15, 2023, guidance for Siemens Energy Group was adjusted 
once more."
"Given that the business volume had increased more 
substantially than anticipated in the first half of the year, the forecast 
for comparable revenue growth was increased on the basis of higher 
assumptions for all segments."
"On account of the weak performance by 
Siemens Gamesa in the first half of the year, the Profit margin before 
Special items was then expected to be at the lower end of the guidance 
range."
"As a result, it was believed that the Net loss would be higher than 
before."
"The guidance for Free cash flow pre tax was confirmed and 
refined."
"In response to 
the substantially higher failure rates of various wind turbine 
components, an extended technical review showed that achieving the 
target product quality would entail considerably higher costs than 
previously assumed."
"Other expenses also occurred, primarily in 
connection with increased product costs and challenges associated 
with the ramp-up of offshore activities."
"On August 7, 2023, an updated 
forecast was issued in the context of regular reporting for the third 
quarter."
"As a result of the changed expectations for revenue and profit 
at Siemens Gamesa, the forecast for comparable revenue growth at 
Siemens Energy was reduced and a clearly negative Profit margin 
before Special items was assumed."
"The expected Net loss was once 
more adjusted upward by a considerable amount."
"In addition to the 
negative impacts already described in the ad hoc release of 
June 22, 2023, the new forecast reflected the lower profit 
contributions by Siemens Gamesa from processing its order backlog."
"Moreover, the outlook for Free cash flow pre tax was reduced to a 
negative figure."
"We met the updated forecasts with the positive exception of the 
withdrawn forecast for Free cash flow pre tax, which was overachieved 
by a clear margin."
"Dividend 
Our dividend policy is to pay out 40% to 60% of our Net income 
attributable to shareholders of Siemens Energy AG."
"In view of the 
earnings in fiscal year 2023, the Executive Board, in agreement with the 
Supervisory Board, has decided to propose to the Shareholders’ Meeting 
not to distribute a dividend."
"For fiscal year 2022, no dividend was paid."
"Over the course of the year, the economy was further influenced by the 
effects of the war in Ukraine and the resulting geopolitical 
uncertainties."
"Besides the energy crisis (see below), which was associated with 
higher energy prices than before the Ukraine war, a general increase in 
prices led to high inflation rates, especially in the U.S."
Inflation peaked in the first months of calendar year 2023.
"Interest 
rates, as an instrument supporting a decline in inflation, started to 
increase in 2022, especially in the eurozone and the U.S."
"This develop-
pment continued in fiscal year 2023."
"As a result, inflation declined to 
5.5% in the EU and 3.3% in the U.S."
"by mid-2023 but remained at a 
higher level than usual."
"Overall, global inflation is forecast at 6.9% in 
calendar year 2023, after 8.7% in calendar year 2022."
"Global imports and exports remain tied to economic activity and, 
despite some regional dynamics, industrial and private demand 
declined during the fiscal year."
"Given these conditions, expectations for global GDP growth in calendar 
year 2023 have been revised downward to 3.0%, a decline from the 
3.5% growth observed in calendar year 2022."
"Industrial nations are 
expected to achieve a growth rate of 1.5%, while emerging and deve-
loping economies are projected to grow at a rate of 4.0% over the same 
period."
"These GDP projections are based on the data published by the 
International Monetary Fund in their World Economic Outlook report 
titled ""Navigating Global Divergences"", October 2023."
"Energy crisis and energy market 
Although some of the tensions in energy markets have subsided in 
2023 following an extended period of turbulence since 2020, there are 
still several risk factors to consider."
"The relatively warm winter in 
2022/2023 coupled with a slowdown in industrial demand and 
production, led to a relative stabilization of energy prices at slightly 
higher levels than values before the Ukraine war."
"The war continues to 
show no signs of ending and keeps the energy market uncertain."
"Global 
LNG markets at the beginning of 2023 were dominated by fierce 
competition for available LNG, that increased the price in several APAC 
countries that relied strongly on imports."
"However, towards mid-2023, 
as the global export, transport and capacity for gas reserves increased 
worldwide, LNG prices have stabilized and are expected to have a 
milder dynamic compared to last year."
"The energy crisis and its effects accelerate the transition of the energy 
market away from fossil fuels towards the use of renewable energy 
sources and increased energy efficiency and savings."
"The transition of 
the energy market started to accelerate even more in calendar 
year 2023."
"One of the factors supporting the accelerated energy 
transition is the Inflation Reduction Act, introduced in the U.S."
"Another example is the updates to the existing European 
REPowerEU initiative."
"Supply market conditions 
In the past fiscal year, the situation regarding the raw material and 
supply markets eased comparatively, with the risk situation also 
stabilizing to some extent, however, at a higher level than in previous 
years."
"The increase in demand due to the recovery in consumption and 
the inventory replenishment following the COVID-19 pandemic initially 
continued."
"In addition, in the first half of the past fiscal year, on the 
supply side high inflation, particularly with high energy prices and the 
impact of the Ukraine war overlapped with an already weakened supply 
base caused by the extended COVID-19 measures."
"Additional pressure 
was exerted by increasing economic and political tensions between the 
U.S."
"and China, which, coupled with high inflation, is likely to have 
longer lasting effects on value chains."
"In addition to the risks from 
political tensions, the relative scarcity of special raw materials (e.g."
"rare 
earths) as well as cybersecurity and shortages of road transport drivers 
remain among the biggest risks in the supply markets."
"Over the course of the year, prices on the supply markets initially 
remained at the elevated level of the previous year, as idled capacities 
took time to come back into operation."
"As production levels rose again, 
the momentum in raw material prices went flat towards the middle of 
fiscal year 2023."
"In the second half of the year demand and prices fell 
on a broad basis."
"This was particularly the case for steel used in wind 
towers and wind turbine components, as prices for steel raw materials 
such as iron ore and cocking coal were below the average level of fiscal 
year 2022."
"Prices also stabilized for base metals such as aluminum and 
copper."
"Rare earths used for magnets continued to record high price 
levels until a clear downward trend began towards the end of the fiscal 
year."
"Global logistics costs in air, ground, and sea freight have reached 
historical lows after peaking by the end of calendar year 2022, 
continuing their downward trend as overall capacity increases, port 
congestion eases and fuel prices normalize."
"However, pricing pressures 
remained in specific markets for equipment and components used in 
energy-related solutions, as these markets showed strong growth 
decoupled from markets overall."
"Impact on business performance at Siemens Energy 
In the past fiscal year, Siemens Energy faced a favorable environment 
in its sales markets due to the situation with the energy market."
"The 
further accelerated transformation of the energy market in calendar 
year 2023 had a positive effect on the associated market opportunities 
for Siemens Energy and, in addition, also benefited our current orders 
in fiscal year 2023 particularly."
"For example, our grid business 
benefited from the expansion of renewable energy through the 
required grid connections as well as energy storage and grid 
stabilization measures."
"In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act and 
updates to the REPowerEU initiative began to have a positive impact on 
Siemens Energy's business performance in the past fiscal year."
The same applies to our supply chain.
"Siemens Energy benefited from 
the overall improvement in economic environment."
"In GT, in particular, 
the easing of the supply chain situation and declining material and 
logistics costs had a positive impact on earnings."
"However, there were 
supply bottlenecks for certain components (e.g."
"turbine blades in the 
GS 
segment)."
"Despite 
a 
relative 
easing 
of 
the 
situation, 
Siemens Gamesa continued to be impacted by comparatively high 
procurement costs tied to customer projects to which it was already 
contractually committed."
"Even though greater attention was placed on 
implementing price escalation clauses in fiscal year 2023 and successes 
were achieved in renegotiating customer contracts, Siemens Gamesa 
continues to focus on adequate risk diversification in customer 
contracts."
"We continue to take account of the ongoing risk situation and 
challenges in supply markets through a wide range of monitoring and 
assessment programs which allow timely countermeasures."
"As a result of this 
reorganization, we reassigned the former divisions of the reportable 
segment GP to three Business Areas and introduced leaner structures 
and flatter hierarchies."
"These measures are to be complemented by the 
full integration of Siemens Gamesa which is part of the continuing 
strategic development of Siemens Energy."
"The voluntary cash tender offer to acquire outstanding shares in 
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
"announced on May 21, 2022, 
was publicly launched on November 8, 2022, and successfully 
completed in the first quarter of the past fiscal year resulting in 
Siemens Energy's total shareholding of 92.7%."
"Following the acquisi-
tion of additional shares under a further tender offer from Decem-
ber 23, 2022 to February 7, 2023, Siemens Energy's shareholding in 
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
"On 
January 25, 2023, the shareholders of Siemens Gamesa Renewable 
Energy S.A."
"approved the delisting of the company from the Spanish 
stock exchanges at an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting."
"Following 
the approval by the Spanish National Securities Market Commission 
(CNMV), delisting was effective on February 14, 2023."
"With the 
subsequently approved capital reduction and compensation of the 
remaining 
minority 
shareholders, 
Siemens Energy 
fully 
owns 
Siemens Gamesa effective July 12, 2023."
"Accordingly, the company 
will operate under the name Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A.U."
"We have thus created the legal preconditions for the full integration of 
Siemens Gamesa."
"Accordingly, we immediately began to implement 
step by step an integration program set up at the beginning of fiscal 
year 2023."
"This primarily involves implementing structures and 
processes to integrate Siemens Gamesa more closely into the Group's 
central and global functions."
"The full integration of Siemens Gamesa will further simplify 
Siemens Energy's corporate structure and enable its holistic market 
approach."
"This should enable synergies to be realized in a number of 
areas, e.g."
corresponding cost savings.
"In addition, Siemens Gamesa 
can be supported even more strongly in overcoming the current 
challenges and benefit from our company's ability to return businesses 
to an economically successful path."
"Optimization of operational structures and processes 
In fiscal year 2023 we continued our “Accelerating Impact” program 
(AIP) in the new organizational structure."
"The aim of AIP is to 
permanently reduce our costs and thereby strengthen our competitive-
ness in a difficult market environment."
"Most of the announced cost 
reduction measures have either already been implemented and the rest 
to be implemented by fiscal year 2025 latest."
"AIP envisaged a reduction of approximately 7,800 jobs worldwide by 
the end of fiscal year 2025."
"Due to improved market conditions and 
volume growth, the Executive Board's assessment of the program's pro-
gress has changed."
"For Germany, the company has therefore decided 
to end the job cuts agreed in the AIP framework prematurely."
"To this 
end, we are focusing mainly on training measures to fill vacant 
positions in Germany internally wherever possible."
"This resulted in a 
positive effect on profit in the amount of €78 million, which affected 
the GS segment, the TI segment and the Reconciliation to Consolidated 
Financial Statements."
"In fiscal year 2022, Siemens Gamesa introduced the ""Mistral"" strategy 
program."
"This 
contained 
a 
new 
operating 
model 
effective 
January 1, 2023, which created clear responsibilities, particularly for 
the areas of production and technology."
"The manufacturing and technology expertise of Onshore and Offshore, 
which had previously been separate, was merged under the leadership 
of the Chief Technology Officer (Technology) and the Chief Operating 
Officer (Manufacturing)."
"The aim was and is to create synergies in order 
to optimize the products in the entire portfolio."
"As offshore only 
operates in a few countries and is a centralized business, while onshore 
operates at a regional level, the sales and project execution activities of 
both business fields remained separate."
"In addition to the project and process-
oriented operating model, ""Mistral"" comprises many activities that are 
carried out in parallel and pursue various approaches aimed at short, 
medium and long-term improvements."
"The focal points of activities in 
fiscal year 2023 were: 
• Improvement in margins by renegotiating customer and supplier 
contracts."
"In particular, prices for customer contracts were raised and 
more favorable conditions were agreed in order to be better 
prepared for cost increases and risks beyond Siemens Gamesa's 
control."
• Focus on Siemens Gamesa's target markets.
"For the onshore busi-
ness, this entails streamlining the portfolio and focusing on select 
target markets to reduce complexity and drive economies of scale."
"Newly acquired projects preferably include long-term service com-
mitments."
"For the offshore business, the main target is to maintain 
Siemens Gamesa’s leadership position in the market by driving next-
generation wind turbines with lower maintenance demand."
"Against the background of quality problems, in particular of the 4.X and 
5.X onshore turbines as well as increased product costs and ramp-up 
challenges in the offshore business, the strategic framework of “Mistral” 
was updated immediately."
"Ongoing remedial measures include regular 
analyses of forecast cost savings (including the assessment of reasons 
for deviations) and the continuous development of existing and the 
creation of new productivity measures."
"Quality issues, higher product costs and ramp-up 
challenges at Siemens Gamesa 
During fiscal year 2023, Profit at Siemens Gamesa was affected by 
substantial negative impacts in connection with quality issues in 
particular of the 4.X and 5.X onshore turbines."
"In addition, 
Siemens Gamesa suffered from increased product costs and ramp-up 
challenges in the offshore business."
"In the course of the regular annual evaluation of the entire installed 
wind turbine fleet (validation process) in the first quarter of fiscal 
year 2023, Siemens Gamesa identified a negative trend in the failure 
rates of certain components."
"The process uses a 
complex statistical model to forecast trends in the failure rates 
throughout the operating life of the respective components by 
extrapolating empirical data (based on technical conditions and 
influencing factors, practical experience, etc.)."
"The failure rates 
anticipated as a result are then linked with the cost and volume data for 
deployment factors (e.g."
"operating hours, ship/crane days, tools and 
spare parts required together with the associated costs) for any 
necessary maintenance/repairs."
"In addition, a technical assessment 
based on a root cause analysis is carried out to determine the extent to 
which the issues relate to individual cases or the entire fleet."
"The 
statistical model is based on numerous parameters, such as technical 
assumptions, experience gained from many years of operating wind 
turbines, meteorological conditions and information about suppliers."
"The results were considered when valuation of provisions or when 
measuring the planned costs of ongoing projects."
"This resulted in an increase of assumed 
warranty and maintenance costs, which had a negative impact of 
€0.5 billion on Profit of Siemens Gamesa in the first quarter affecting in 
particular the Siemens Gamesa service business which holds the 
associated maintenance contracts."
"Following this scheduled update of the forecast failure rates, first signs 
of further quality issues with the 4.X and 5.X onshore platforms were 
identified later in fiscal year 2023."
"A technical task force was 
established for each of these two platforms with the aim of identifying 
technical defects and their root causes."
"Measures in this connection 
included inspecting the wind turbines on site and in the 
Siemens Gamesa factories."
"On the basis of the working groups’ 
provisional technical findings, an extraordinary validation process was 
performed."
"Due to the defects found in the rotor blades and main 
bearings, it was necessary to make a sharp upward adjustment to the 
forecast failure rates of these components for the 4.X and 5.X 
platforms."
"The expected disruptions to turbine operation based on the 
predicted failure rates may occur after a certain period of operation, but 
this does not necessarily have to be the case."
"Consequently, the 
turbines can continue to be operated for the most part in the meantime."
"However, 
to 
ensure 
long-term, 
incident-free 
operation, 
Siemens Energy is seeking to rectify the issues within the normal 
service intervals."
"In conjunction with the objective of guaranteeing the target product 
quality, raising the forecast failure rates resulted in considerably higher 
expected costs than had been assumed previously."
"This had a negative 
impact of €1.6 billion on Profit of Siemens Gamesa in the third quarter 
of fiscal year 2023."
"Part of these charges resulted from revenue 
reversals, as the percentage of completion in project accounting is 
based on the ratio of actual to planned costs and declined in part due 
to the increased planned costs."
"The majority of cash outflows are 
expected to occur over the next ten fiscal years, with approximately one 
third expected in the next two fiscal years."
"A Group-wide task force with members from all functions and external 
technical experts has been established to resolve the quality issues with 
the 4.X and 5.X platforms."
"Siemens Energy is currently evaluating 
whether claims for damages can be asserted against third parties for 
selected problems."
"Certain suppliers have already been excluded from 
further deliveries."
"In addition to the quality-related impacts in the onshore area, there 
were further charges of €0.6 billion in the third quarter of the fiscal 
year, mainly due to higher product costs and challenges in the ramp-up 
of offshore activities."
"In order to fulfill the EU’s targets for renewable energy, it is necessary 
to dramatically accelerate the pace of construction, especially of 
offshore wind turbines."
"Siemens Gamesa is currently in the process of 
ramping up various factories for offshore production or of modifying 
them to manufacture larger turbines."
"These facilities are located in 
France, Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom, among others."
"The ramp-up of the new and modified capacities has been delayed due 
to various factors."
"Due to the situation on the procurement markets, 
there were delays in completing the factory infrastructure."
"Additional 
delays resulted from the lack of human resources due to tight labor 
markets."
"These delays caused unexpected cost increases and meant 
that it was not possible to achieve the planned productivity 
improvements and efficiency gains expected from the capacity 
expansions."
"The combination of higher costs and lower productivity 
and efficiency exacerbated the negative effect of the ramp-up delays 
and impacted the product costs to be recognized."
"This not only affected 
the Profit margins of ongoing projects but also means that individual 
projects for which binding offers have been submitted can no longer be 
executed profitably if the customer signs the contract."
"The cash outflows relating to these issues are expected to be spread 
across several years."
"Moreover, the expenses at Siemens Gamesa led to negative tax effects 
due to a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately 
€0.8 billion (see also 2.4.2 Profitability)."
"As a result of the quality issues that occurred, the failure of components 
was monitored continuously in the subsequent course of the fiscal year."
"The observed failures were higher than expected for certain compo-
nents."
"This could indicate that a reassessment of the failure rate may be 
necessary."
"The root cause analysis of the quality issues identified in 
fiscal year 2023 is still ongoing and is expected to be completed during 
Combined Management Report 20 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
the first half of fiscal year 2024."
"This may lead to adjustments of the 
expected failure rates and might have material negative effects on net 
assets, financial position and results of operations."
"In view of the results 
obtained to date on failures and considering the short additional 
statistical observation period, the models updated in the third quarter 
of fiscal year 2023 continue to represent the most reliable basis for the 
best estimate of failure rates."
"In fiscal year 2023, the negative impacts on Profit (excluding tax 
aspects) due to the aforementioned quality issues in particular of the 
4.X and 5.X onshore turbines, increased product costs and ramp-up 
challenges in the offshore-activities totaled €2.7 billion."
"Of this 
amount, €0.6 billion related to the reversal of revenue, €0.7 billion to 
provisions for warranty costs and €1.2 billion to provisions for onerous 
contracts."
"This contributed to a very strong increase in negative Profit before 
Special items of Siemens Gamesa to €4.3 billion in the past fiscal year 
compared to the prior year."

"• This was benefited by the positive market environment for 
Siemens Energy, in particular by the development of demand 
resulting from the accelerated transition of the energy markets."
"• The growth in order intake was driven by increases at GT and 
Siemens Gamesa which were based on higher volumes from large 
orders."
"• Nominal order intake, i.e."
"including negative currency translation 
and portfolio effects, also increased substantially."
"• The service share of Siemens Energy’s orders amounted to 32% in 
fiscal year 2023, unchanged from the prior year."
"Gas Services 
• GS recorded a clear year-on-year increase in order intake on a 
comparable basis."
"This growth resulted primarily from large orders 
in the Americas reporting region, especially from the U.S."
"The largest 
single order concerned a combined cycle power plant project in 
Brazil with a volume of close to €400 million."
"• Due to negligible currency translation and portfolio effects, the 
nominal increase in orders corresponded to comparable growth."
"• A substantial increase in order volume in the service business offset 
the decline in the new units business."
"As a result, the service share 
of the orders at GS also expanded substantially compared with the 
prior year to 71% (2022: 59%)."
"Grid Technologies 
• GT benefited from the positive market environment and grew its 
order intake by more than half on a comparable basis year-on-year."
The largest growth came from the solutions business.
"The product 
business also recorded strong growth."
"In regional terms, the 
strongest growth came from Europe and the U.S."
"• The largest orders related to offshore grid connections in the German 
North Sea and included, among others, the largest order ever 
received by Siemens Energy for an offshore grid connection."
"• Nominal order intake, including negative currency translation and 
portfolio effects, also increased sharply."
• The new units business was crucial to the growth in order volume.
"The service business, which is usually low at GT, also recorded mode-
rate growth."
"In relation to total business, the share decreased to 4% 
in the past fiscal year (2022: 6%)."
"Transformation of Industry 
• TI slightly increased its order intake on a comparable basis following 
a strong prior year despite a low volume from large orders."
"With the 
exception of Compression, all separate businesses recorded in-
creases."
"In geographical terms, most of the increase came from the 
U.S., Europe and China."
"• Due to negative currency translation and portfolio effects, order 
intake declined slightly on a nominal basis."
"• The increase in the service business clearly exceeded the increase in 
the new units business."
"As a result, the share of the service business 
in TI orders grew year-on-year to 42% (2022: 41%)."
"Combined Management Report 22 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
Siemens Gamesa 
• Markets served by Siemens Gamesa were characterized by the 
accelerated transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy."
"Against 
this backdrop, order intake at Siemens Gamesa increased by 
approximately 50% on a comparable basis, with a higher volume of 
large orders."
"Growth in the offshore and in the service business was 
offset by a decline in the onshore business."
"In the prior year, the 
onshore business had benefited from an order intake of €613 million 
in connection with the sale of a portfolio of wind farm development 
projects in Southern Europe."
"In regional terms, the largest growth 
was recorded in the U.S., Europe and Taiwan."
• The order volume was driven by large offshore projects.
"The largest 
orders for wind farm projects came from the U.S., Taiwan and the 
United Kingdom and delivered a total volume of more than 
€5.3 billion."
"• Including negative currency translation effects, order intake on a 
nominal basis also increased sharply."
"• The service share of Siemens Gamesa’s order intake amounted to 
25% in the past fiscal year (2022: 24%)."
"Regions (location of customer) 
• In geographical terms, order intake by Siemens Energy increased in 
all reporting regions on a comparable basis."
"• The substantial growth in order intake in Europe, C.I.S., Middle 
East, Africa (EMEA) was based on the substantial increase in 
Europe, which was due to the volume of individual large orders."
"The 
largest growth was recorded in Germany, primarily due to the 
aforementioned grid connection orders received by GT."
"GS also saw 
sharp increases in Germany, although these were far smaller in 
absolute terms than those recorded by GT."
"In addition, sharp growth 
in the Western European countries contributed to the development 
in Europe."
"This was mainly due to the increases at Siemens Gamesa, 
especially as a result of large orders in UK and France."
"• The Americas reporting region also delivered a considerable 
contribution to growth."
"A large part of the substantial increase in 
order intake came from the U.S., where development was based on 
growth in all segments."
"The increase was particularly strong at 
Siemens Gamesa, followed by GS."
"Growth at Siemens Gamesa was 
mainly due to the aforementioned large orders."
"• Asia, Australia also posted substantial growth on a comparable 
basis."
"The driving force for development in this reporting region was 
the sharp growth at Siemens Gamesa in Taiwan, which offset 
declines in other areas of the reporting region, especially the 
countries of the Pacific region."
"Revenue 
Siemens Energy 
• In fiscal year 2023, revenue of Siemens Energy rose clearly year-on-
year on a comparable basis."
"This development was largely attribu-
table to the processing of the order backlog, resulting especially from 
the prior year’s strong order intake."
"• Due to negative currency translation and portfolio effects, the 
increase in nominal revenue was slightly lower than on a comparable 
basis."
"• As revenue from the service business grew more strongly than that 
from the new units business, the service share in Siemens Energy 
revenue increased to 36% (2022: 35%)."
"Gas Services 
• The significant increase in GS revenue on a comparable basis was 
based primarily on solid execution of the order backlog, especially 
for central energy generation."
"• Due to negative currency translation and portfolio effects, growth in 
the nominal revenue of GS was slightly below comparable growth."
"• As the new units business posted a higher percentage increase in 
revenue than the service business, the service share in GS revenue 
declined to 61% (2022: 63%)."
"Grid Technologies 
• On a comparable basis, GT revenue significantly increased year-on-
year."
"By far the largest contribution came from processing the order 
intake from prior years."
"Revenue rose across all businesses, with the 
strongest growth posted by the product and solutions businesses."
"• Due to negative currency translation and portfolio effects, the 
increase in the nominal revenue of GT was slightly lower than 
comparable growth."
"• As in the prior year, the service business contributed 7% to GT’s 
revenue in the past year."
"Transformation of Industry 
• The significant growth in TI revenue on a comparable basis was built 
on processing the prior years’ orders."
"All of the independent business 
operations posted gains, with the largest (absolute) contribution 
delivered by Industrial Steam Turbines & Generators, followed by 
Compression."
"• The increase in TI's revenue on a nominal basis was lower than on a 
comparable basis due to negative currency translation and portfolio 
effects, but the increase was nevertheless clear."
"• The service business saw stronger revenue growth than the new 
units business and therefore made a contribution of 46% to TI 
revenue in the past fiscal year (2022: 45%)."
"Siemens Gamesa 
• On a comparable basis, revenue of Siemens Gamesa was moderately 
lower than in the prior year."
"In addition, prior-year revenue 
had benefited from the aforementioned sale of a portfolio of wind 
farm development projects in Southern Europe."
"• Due to negative currency translation effects, there was a clear 
decline in revenue on a nominal basis."
"• Decreases in both the onshore and the service business offset the 
growth in the offshore business."
"• The service business contributed 23% to Siemens Gamesa revenue 
in the past fiscal year (2022: 22%)."
"23

Regions (location of customer) 
• The pattern of revenue development in the reporting regions 
correlated with order intake."
"All regions posted growth on a compa-
rable basis."
"• All segments, with the exception of Siemens Gamesa, contributed to 
the moderate increase in revenue in the EMEA reporting region."
"This 
gain was based above all on the significant increase in GT revenue, 
followed by the clear growth at TI."
"• The significant increase in revenue in the Americas region also 
resulted from increases in the GS, GT and TI segments that offset the 
clear decline at Siemens Gamesa, especially in Brazil."
"Growth in the 
region was driven by the substantial increases at GS, especially in the 
U.S."
"• Revenue increased significantly in Asia, Australia as well."
"The 
pattern of development matched that in the other regions."
"All 
segments, with the exception of Siemens Gamesa, posted increases 
on a comparable basis."
"The dominant factor was the substantial 
growth of GS in the region."

"This resulted in adjustments to prior year figures for 
orders in the EMEA region by minus €10 million, the Americas by minus €183 million and Asia, Australia by € 193 million."
"The prior year revenue figures were adjusted by minus €8 million in the EMEA region, by €1 million in the 
Americas and by €7 million in Asia, Australia."
"Book-to-bill ratio and order backlog 
• Due to the aforementioned developments, the book-to-bill ratio at 
Siemens Energy was 1.62."
"The increase from the prior-year value of 
1.32 was primarily attributable to the substantial increase in orders."
The book-to-bill ratio of all segments was clearly above 1.
"By 
segment, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.18 (2022: 1.24) at GS, 2.20 
(2022: 1.66) at GT, 1.25 (2022: 1.39) at TI and 1.85 (2022: 1.18) at 
Siemens Gamesa."
"• By the end of the fiscal year, the order backlog at Siemens Energy 
increased significantly to a new record of €112 billion, compared 
with €97 billion in the prior year."
"The growth was curbed by negative 
currency translation effects."
"The order backlog was €41 billion 
(2022: 42 billion) at GS, €23 billion (2022: €15 billion) at GT and 
€7 billion (2022: €6 billion) at TI."
"With €42 billion, Siemens Gamesa 
again exceeded its prior-year high (€35 billion)."

"The 
sharp rise in Profits of GS, GT and TI was based above all on higher 
revenues and operational improvements."
"In addition, GT and TI 
benefited from a decline in negative impacts from supply-related 
issues (e.g."
"global supply chain constraints and higher material and 
logistics costs)."
"This positive development was supported by lower 
negative impacts from Special items, which more than halved for 
Siemens Energy overall."
"As a result, Profit of Siemens Energy fell sharply to 
negative €2,960 million (2022: negative €188 million)."
"• Two factors in particular were critical to the decline in negative 
Special items and affected the GS, GT and TI segments."
"Moreover, the prior year’s 
Profit was impacted by Special items in the amount of €0.2 billion in 
connection with the restructuring of the Company’s business 
activities in Russia that were reported as strategic portfolio decisions."
"• Due to the declining negative Special items, Profit before Special 
items of Siemens Energy decreased more substantially in absolute 
terms than Profit."
"Consequently, the deterioration of the Profit 
margin was almost one percentage point higher than the deteriora-
tion of the Profit margin before Special items."
"Gas Services 
• GS doubled its Profit due to higher revenue, an improved cost 
structure and a more favorable business mix due to a larger contri-
bution from the service business."
"Moreover, the positive effects of 
price adjustment clauses in customer contracts more than offset the 
increased costs."
"• In addition, Profit overall included positive Special items in connec-
tion with the aforementioned change in the assessment of the 
further progress of the Accelerating Impact program."
"The elimina-
tion of impacts relating to Russia also had a favorable effect."
"• Due to the development of Special items, Profit before Special items 
of GS did not grow as substantially as Profit."
"The corresponding 
margin increased by three percentage points."
"Grid Technologies 
• GT more than tripled its Profit, which was attributable to high-margin 
volume growth and operational improvements."
"In addition, GT 
benefited from positive effects yielded by hedging transactions."
"The 
prior year Profit was affected by the strong headwind resulting from 
supply chain constraints, negative impacts in connection with higher 
material and logistics costs and negative effects from hedging trans-
actions."
"• The negative Special items declined sharply, primarily as a result of 
eliminating the impacts connected with restructuring the business in 
Russia."
"• Due to the lower negative Special items compared with the prior 
year, GT’s Profit before Special items did not grow as substantially as 
Profit although it did more than double."
"The same applies to the 
corresponding margin, which increased by four percentage points."
"Transformation of Industry 
• TI continued the positive trend begun in the prior year and achieved 
the turnaround in fiscal year 2023."
"With the exception of the invest-
ment-intensive future business Sustainable Energy Systems, all of 
the separate businesses – headed by Industrial Turbines & Genera-
tors – grew their contributions to Profit sharply, in some cases many 
times over."
"The reasons for this development were higher revenue, 
a more favorable business mix with a larger contribution from the 
service business and operational improvements that resulted in a 
better cost position."
"Added to these were positive currency effects 
and smaller positive one-time items in the Compression and Electrifi-
cation, Automation, Digitalization businesses."
"• The sharp decline in negative Special items was due on the one hand 
to the change in the assessment of the further progress of the Acce-
lerating Impact program and the end of the Russia-related charges."
"On the other hand, the prior year had included an impairment in 
connection with the sale of a business (reported as a strategic port-
folio decision)."
"• Due to the development of Special items, TI’s Profit before Special 
items increased less in absolute terms than Profit although they did 
grow more than five-fold."
"The same applies to the corresponding 
margin, which increased by four percentage points."

"Siemens Gamesa 
• In the past fiscal year, the negative Profit of Siemens Gamesa again 
increased sharply compared to the prior year."
"In addition 
to these impacts, Profit continued to reflect the effects of inflation 
and supply chain challenges."
"In the past fiscal year, favorable effects 
came from one-time revenue items in the high double-digit million 
euro range attributable to non-recurring business activities."
"The prior 
year Profit had included a positive effect of €565 million from the 
sale of a portfolio of wind farm development projects in Southern 
Europe."
"• The negative Special items were almost on a par with the prior year 
and largely consisted of restructuring costs in connection with 
implementing the Mistral program."
"• Due to the developments described above, Profit before Special 
items and the corresponding margin also deteriorated sharply."
"Other central items include 
Siemens brand fees, corporate services (e.g."
"management of the 
Group’s real estate portfolio (except Siemens Gamesa), which was 
allocated to the GP segment in the prior year), corporate projects, 
centrally held equity interests and other items."
"• The negative year-on-year change in the result of Reconciliation to 
Consolidated Financial Statements was primarily attributable to 
increased costs for the central corporate functions."
"It was offset by a 
positive one-time effect in connection with a legacy power plant 
construction project."
"• Negative Special items increased substantially, primarily due to 
integration costs in connection with the full integration of 
Siemens Gamesa."
"By contrast, the restructuring costs were impacted 
positively by the change in the assessment of the further progress of 
Combined Management Report 26 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
the Accelerating Impact program."
"Moreover, the negative impacts 
from prior-year issues relating to Russia were no longer included in 
Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements."
"• Due to the increase in negative Special items, the decline in Profit 
before Special items was slightly lower than the decrease in Profit."
"Net income (loss) and basic earnings per share 
• In the past fiscal year, the loss increased sharply."
"The increase in 
interest expenses related to increased debt and higher interest rates 
outweighed the increase in interest income attributable to higher 
interest on deposits."
"Moreover, income decreased year-on-year as a 
result of discounting in connection with non-current provisions, 
which were reported in other financial income (expenses)."
"This was 
offset by a substantial decline in the amortization of intangible assets 
acquired in business combinations as well as goodwill impairments."
"• Overall, Profit development in Siemens Gamesa was the main factor 
for the increase in the loss before income taxes of Siemens Energy."
"• The tax rate of Siemens Energy in the past fiscal year was negative 
35% (2022: negative 18%)."
"The higher negative tax rate was due to 
losses without corresponding tax relief at Siemens Gamesa and to a 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately 
€0,8 billion resulting from the changed business outlook at 
Siemens Gamesa."
"• Due to the developments described above, Siemens Energy Group 
reported a Net loss in the past fiscal year, which was sharply higher 
than a year earlier."
"• In percentage terms, the corresponding negative basic earnings per 
share increased far more substantially than the Net loss due to the 
acquisition of the non-controlling interest in Siemens Gamesa 
Renewable Energy S.A."
"(see 2.3.2 Events and developments 
responsible for the course of business)."
"As a result, the portion of 
the Net loss attributable to the shareholders of Siemens Energy AG 
increased disproportionately compared with the prior year."
"Considerable negative currency transla-
tion effects impacted both assets and liabilities."
"The acquisition of 
the outstanding shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
was also reflected in individual items of both assets and liabilities.
"• The decline on the assets side was largely driven by effects in con-
nection with the aforementioned acquisition of shares, which was 
mainly responsible for the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and 
in other current financial assets."
"Changes to the asset components 
of the operating net working capital had an offsetting effect."
"Negative currency translation effects amounted to approximately 
€ 2.2 billion."
"The proportion of non-current assets in total assets 
remained almost constant at 45% (2022: 44%)."
"Development on the 
liabilities side was affected mostly by the decrease in equity."
"The 
decline was partly offset by the increase in liability components of 
the operating net working capital and by the growth of debt and 
provisions."
"• The substantial decrease in cash and cash equivalents was mainly 
due to the above-mentioned acquisition of shares."
"• Other current financial assets decreased sharply to €720 million 
(2022: €2,509 million)."
"This was primarily attributable to the use of 
cash collateral of €1,148 million deposited with the Spanish National 
Securities Market Commission in connection with the acquisition of 
the outstanding shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
"(see 2.3.2 Events and developments responsible for the course of 
business) and to the development of fair values of derivative 
financial instruments."
"• In the operating net working capital, a clear increase in the asset 
components was accompanied by a significant rise in the liability 
components."
"The substantial increase in contract liabilities, mainly 
due to advance payments on projects, exceeded by far the growth in 
inventories, partly in connection with the processing of the order 
backlog, and in trade and other receivables."
"As a result, the negative 
operating net working capital almost doubled as of the fiscal year-
end to minus €2,991 million (2022: minus €1,520 million)."
"GT 
posted a sharp decline and Siemens Gamesa a substantial decline."
"The operating net working capital (as a percentage of revenue) was 
minus 10% at fiscal year-end (2022: minus 5%)."
"• Assets classified as held for disposal and liabilities associated 
with assets classified as held for disposal decreased following the 
completion of the underlying transactions."
"• Goodwill declined moderately due to negative currency translation 
effects."
Other intangible assets decreased significantly.
"Negative 
currency translation effects and amortization, depreciation and im-
pairments relating to intangible assets acquired in business com-
binations offset the additions to internally generated technology for 
product development at Siemens Gamesa."
"• Debt at Siemens Energy increased sharply year-on-year to 
€4,781 million (2022: €3,224 million)."
"This was primarily attributa-
ble to the placement of a green bond with an aggregate nominal 
amount of €1,500 million and the issue of securities under the 
commercial paper program."
"In addition, a syndicated bridge facility 
that was concluded to finance the acquisition of the outstanding 
shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
"was used (see 
2.6.3 Financing and liquidity analysis)."
"The proceeds of the green 
bond 
were 
used 
to 
refinance 
existing 
borrowings 
by 
Siemens Gamesa, which resulted in shifts between short-term and 
long-term debt."
"• Other current financial liabilities fell sharply to €694 million 
(2022: €1,423 million)."
"This was mainly related to the development 
of fair values of derivative financial instruments."
"• The clear rise in other current liabilities to €3,375 million 
(2022: €3,120 million) was primarily due to increases in liabilities to 
personnel and reservation fees."
"• Provisions increased sharply year-on-year to €5,583 million 
(2022: €3,928 million)."
"This applied equally to short-term and long-
term provisions."
"• Equity of Siemens Energy decreased sharply due to the decline in 
the portion of equity attributable to the shareholders of 
Siemens Energy AG."
"Alongside the negative Total comprehensive in-
come, the main factor was the acquisition of the outstanding shares 
in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
"as this was a transaction 
with owners recognized directly in equity."
"As a result, retained 
earnings decreased by €4,461 million."
"This was offset by a capital 
increase carried out in fiscal year 2023, which increased the Capital 
stock and Capital reserve by €73 million and €1,171 million, 
respectively."
"Due to the aforementioned acquisition of shares, non-
controlling interests rose to €285 million (2022: minus €4 million)."
"• As a result of the change in equity, the equity ratio (equity to total 
assets) at fiscal year-end declined to 18% (2022: 34%)."
"The protection of 
the Group’s long-term financial stability and flexibility includes the 
solvency of Group entities at any time, the reduction of financial risks 
and a balanced capital structure."
"• The Treasury & Corporate Finance organization of Siemens Energy 
manages treasury and financing activities, including guarantees, 
letters of credit, insurance, pensions, sale of receivables, leasing, and 
supply chain finance."
"• Certain treasury and financing activities are managed centrally by 
Treasury & Corporate Finance to the extent reasonable to ensure 
transparency and cost efficiency, e.g."
"liquidity and financing of the 
Group, bank relations, treasury infrastructure, as well as manage-
ment of financial risks, pensions, pension service providers, 
insurances (broking, advisory, claims management and provider 
management) and guarantees."
"• The centralized coordination and management of market risks 
(foreign currencies, interest rates, commodities), bank partners, 
insurance and pensions ensure a comprehensive risk management 
approach."
"Treasury is the central partner for derivative hedging 
transactions entered into by Siemens Energy, as far as this is 
permissible under local foreign exchange regulations."
"Treasury is 
therefore largely responsible for entering into external hedging 
transactions with banks."
"• The provision of Treasury infrastructure involves cash pooling, 
among other things."
"A centralized cash management system enables 
excess liquidity at individual Group entities to be used to cover the 
financing requirements of other Group entities, which reduces both 
the volume of external financing and interest expenses on Group 
level."
"• For further information on the extent and management of financial 
risks and on financing, see Note 21 Financial risk management in 
3.6 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Added 
to this were clearly increased cash outflows for additions to intan-
gible assets and property, plant and equipment in fiscal year 2023."
"For this reason, the sharp change in con-
tract liabilities – due to higher advance payments from customers – 
and was offset by the reduced cash outflows due to the change in 
inventories."
"An opposing effect came from the swing in the change 
in other assets and liabilities from minus €373 million in the prior 
year to plus €2,059 million in fiscal year 2023."
"• The clear increase in the additions to intangible assets and pro-
perty, plant and equipment was attributable to higher investment 
at GS and GT and for central services (included in the Reconciliation 
to Consolidated Financial Statements)."
"This was offset by a clear 
decline in investment at Siemens Gamesa."
"However, more than half 
of Siemens Energy's investments in the prior fiscal year were made 
at Siemens Gamesa."
"• Investments by GS in the past year were focused mainly on 
maintenance and replacement, mostly relating to the new units 
business."
A further focus was on market-driven innovation.
"GT 
primarily invested capital to expand its production capacities for 
certain products and within the context of selected research and 
development projects."
"One focus here was the further technological 
development and production preparation of an SF6-free product 
portfolio."
"TI concentrated on investing in the development and 
manufacture of sustainable technologies, mainly electrolyzers."
"Moreover, TI made in replacement investments – with the main 
focus on tools and equipment for deployment at all sites – to 
maintain availability and increase productivity and energy efficiency 
in both the new units and service businesses."
"Investments by 
Siemens Gamesa mainly related to leases (primarily for vessels) and 
the plants of the United Kingdom and France."
"There was also a focus 
on improvements in prototypes in Denmark, as well as maintenance 
investments in different countries."
"• At the segment level, there was a sharp increase in Free cash flow 
pre tax at GT but sharp declines at GS and Siemens Gamesa."
"The 
improvement at GT was based on the increase in profit and the sharp 
year-on-year rise in advance payments from customers."
"The increase 
in profit at GS was offset by the net cash outflow due to the change 
in operating net working capital (especially relating to contract 
assets and liabilities)."
"At Siemens Gamesa, the main factor was the 
decline in profit, the cash effect of which was partly offset by the 
change in warranty-related and onerous loss provisions as well as in 
operating net working capital."
"Added to this were cash outflows for acquisitions of 
businesses and for the purchase of investments."
"Cash outflows of 
around €0.4 billion related to the acquisition of certain equity 
interests of the Siemens Group which were not transferred to 
Siemens Energy at the time of the Spin-Off from Siemens."
"In the 
prior year, there were cash inflows from the disposal of investments, 
which were not offset by comparable cash inflows in fiscal 
year 2023."
"This includes cash outflows for com-
pensation payments to owners of non-controlling interests as a 
result of a capital reduction (see Note 3 Acquisitions, disposals and 
assets held for disposal in 3.6 Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements)."
"• There 
was 
an 
additional 
cash 
outflow 
of 
€130 million 
(2022: €– million) for the buyback of shares."
"Further information 
about the share buyback can be found in Note 15 Equity in 
3.6 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
"• By contrast, a capital increase carried out in the past fiscal year 
resulted in cash inflows of €1,243 million."
"For the most part, the cash inflows were used 
to refinance debts (see below), which resulted in corresponding cash 
outflows from the change in debt."
"2.6.3 Financing and liquidity analysis 
Debt, credit facilities and capital structure 
Debt 
• In fiscal year 2023, the debt structure changed compared with the 
prior year."
"As of September 30, 2023, notes and bonds made up 
most of the debt and resulted largely from the placement of a bond 
(see below), the proceeds of which were used to refinance existing 
debts by Siemens Gamesa."
"Refinancing took place in connection 
with the full integration of Siemens Gamesa (see 2.3.2 Events and 
developments responsible for the course of business), as a result 
of which loans from banks were largely administered by Group 
Treasury as of the end of the past fiscal year."
"• In April 2023, Siemens Energy placed a Green Bond with an aggre-
gate nominal amount of €1,500 million divided into two tranches of 
notes of €750 million each."
"One tranche has a maturity of three 
years and an interest rate of 4.00%; the other has a maturity of six 
years and an interest rate of 4.25%."
"• Siemens Energy made use of the program for the issuance of debt 
instruments (commercial paper program) in the past fiscal year."
"As 
of September 30, 2023, debt instruments to the value of 
€432 million (2022: €– million) were outstanding."
"• The unused syndicated bridge facility of €4,200 million that was 
concluded in the prior year to acquire the outstanding shares in 
Siemens Gamesa 
Renewable 
Energy 
S.A."
"was 
reduced 
to 
€620 million in fiscal year 2023 and drawn in full."
"In October 2023, 
the first of two six-month extension options was exercised."
"The 
credit line will now mature in May 2024."
"• Further information about the Company’s debt can be found in 
Note 12 Debt in 3.6 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Credit facilities 
• As of the end of the prior year, Siemens Energy had an unused 
syndicated revolving credit facility of €3,000 million for general 
corporate purposes, which was available unchanged as of Septem-
ber 30, 2023."
"In the past year, the second of two one-year extension 
options was exercised."
The credit facility now has a term until 2026.
"• As of September 30, 2023, Siemens Gamesa had a multi-currency 
revolving credit facility of €2,000 million (2022: €2,500 million)."
"This was unused at the end of the past fiscal year and has a term until 
December 2026."
"There 
are 
contractual 
interactions 
with 
Siemens Energy‘s €3,000 million syndicated revolving credit facility, 
as this provides for a restriction on credit borrowing by group 
subsidiaries."
"Due to the approval by Siemens Energy’s syndicate 
banks, the possibility for Siemens Gamesa to borrow credits after the 
delisting remained possible."
"If this approval is not extended, a 
maximum of €3,300 million could be drawn on the two credit 
facilities in total from July 2024."
"The loan may be used for general 
corporate purposes and to refinance outstanding debt."
"2 
As of September 30, 2023, the net cash position is shown with a negative sign."
"3 
The ratio cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way if the sign becomes negative."
"Therefore, no values are 
shown."
"• Starting fiscal year 2023, receivables and payables from Siemens AG 
from financing activities (2022: net receivables €92 million) are no 
longer part of the net debt/ (net cash)."
"Prior year information is 
presented on a comparable basis."
"• In light of the existing borrowing in connection with the acquisition 
of the outstanding shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy 
S.A., Siemens Energy is and remains committed to an investment-
grade rating."
"The Company achieved this general aim in both the 
past and the prior fiscal year."
"On March 7, 2023, Standard & Poor’s 
Global Ratings confirmed the short-term and long-term ratings of A-
Combined Management Report 32 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
2 and BBB, respectively, and the negative outlook."
"On July 10, 2023, 
the ratings were reduced to A-3 and BBB-, respectively, with stable 
outlook."
"End of November 2023, the outlook of the long-term issuer 
rating was changed from “stable” to “negative”."
"The investment 
grade rating BBB- remains unchanged."
"• The swing from net cash in the prior year to net debt as of Septem-
ber 30, 2023, was attributable to the increase in long-term and 
short-term debt and the decrease in cash and cash equivalents (see 
above for explanations of both)."
"The review was scenario-based and 
covered a period up to September 30, 2025."
"As Siemens Energy offers its customers 
long-term and large-scale construction projects (conventional power 
plants, transmission technology, wind turbines, etc.), the customary 
guarantee lines available to Siemens Energy were also taken into 
account."
"In addition, significant risks and uncertainties over the 
period under review, as set out in Siemens Energy’s risk report, were 
also taken into account."
"• At the time of the preparation of the financial statements agree-
ments for additional guarantee lines have not yet been signed."
"Significant progress has been made in the discussions with banks, 
the German government and Siemens Group so that the Executive 
Board considers the successful conclusion of the process as highly 
likely and has taken this into account in its scenario-based analysis."
"• Following this review, the Executive Board is of the opinion that 
Siemens Energy has sufficient liquidity to continue as a going 
concern for a period of at least 24 months from the balance sheet 
date in all scenarios considered."
"Financing of pension plans and similar commitments 
• Siemens Energy provides post-employment defined benefit plans or 
defined contribution plans to almost all employees in Germany and 
to most employees outside Germany."
"• The majority of pension obligations at Siemens Energy derive from 
three countries: Germany, the United States and the United King-
dom."
"• As of September 30, 2023, the defined benefit obligation (DBO) 
amounted to €2,710 million (thereof: Germany €1,316 million, 
United States €718 million, United Kingdom €187 million and other 
countries €489 million)."
"• The fair value of plan assets was €2,353 million (thereof: Germany 
€1,291 million, United States €500 million, United Kingdom 
€190 million and other countries €373 million)."
"• This led to underfunding of €384 million (2022: €487 million), a 
year-on-year decrease that was largely due to an increase in the 
weighted average discount rate."
"• Further information can be found in Note 13 Post-employment 
benefits/ Provisions for pensions and similar obligations in 
3.6 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
"One of the main 
reasons for the subdued outlook is the increases in interest rates by 
central banks to curb inflation."
"Following global GDP growth of 3.0% 
expected for calendar year 2023, growth of 2.9% is assumed for calen-
dar year 2024."
"After peaking in calendar year 2022, inflation remained at an above-
average level after a decline in 2023."
"Consumer prices in the EU are 
expected to fall to 3.6% in calendar year 2024 (compared to the 
expected value for 2023 of 6.5%)."
"An inflation rate of 2.8% is forecast 
for the U.S."
(4.1% expected for 2023).
"The development of key interest rates is likely to depend on the realiza-
tion of inflation forecasts."
"The European Central Bank is determined to 
reduce inflation to the medium-term target of 2% and believes that key 
interest rates are at a level that, if maintained for a sufficient length, 
will make a significant contribution to achieving this target."
"In the U.S., 
key interest rates reached their highest level since 2001 in July 2023."
"However, both central banks are keeping their options open for further 
increases of interest rates."
"The comparatively high financing costs are 
likely to have a negative impact on both investment and consumer 
spending, thus slowing economic development."
"The EU's gross domestic product is expected to grow by 0.7% in 
calendar year 2023, driven by strong growth in Spain and France."
"By 
contrast, growth is dampened by a slight decline in economic output in 
Germany."
"For calendar year 2024, growth of 1.5% is expected."
"The U.S., 
for which the forecasts have been raised significantly (expected growth 
for the calendar years 2023 and 2024: 2.1% and 1.5% respectively), is 
expected to be a key pillar of global economic development."
"One of the 
biggest risks for the global economy is likely to be the level of economic 
development in China."
"With expected growth of 5.0% for calendar 
year 2023 and an anticipated decline to 4.2% in 2024, China is still 
growing at an above-average rate, but an even sharper decline in 
growth would probably have a noticeably negative impact on the global 
economy."
"The forecasts for GDP and inflation are based on data from the 
International Monetary Fund (""World Economic Outlook: Navigating 
global divergences"" from October 2023)."
"Energy market 
The key trends in the energy sector are expected to persist."
"In addition 
to rising global primary energy demand, these include higher electricity 
production and correspondingly growing electricity generation 
capacities."
"This is linked to economic growth, but also to increasing 
electrification, particularly in the transportation and industrial sectors."
"This is partly due to packages of measures, most notably in the U.S."
"and 
Europe, to drive forward the transition to clean energy."
"In Europe, these 
measures are also aimed at reducing dependence on imported fossil 
fuels."
"As the global focus shifts towards low-carbon power generation 
technologies, the need for structural modernization of electrical 
infrastructure increases."
"Against this backdrop and based on the expectations for macro-
economic development outlined above, we expect demand for electri-
city to increase and return to the pre-COVID-19 growth path in fiscal 
year 2024."
"The markets related to GS are expected to further stabilize 
as a result."
"For GT, it is also assumed that the markets will develop 
positively in fiscal year 2024 because of the continued modernization 
and expansion of the existing transmission infrastructure."
"In particular, 
we expect capacity expansions and grid connections for power 
generation projects in renewable energies, increasing demand for 
energy storage and due to required grid stabilization measures."
"The 
market environment for Siemens Gamesa is likely to remain favorable 
in connection with the energy transition."
"Electricity generation from 
renewable energy is expected to grow faster in calendar year 2023 and 
beyond than achieved in calendar year 2022."
"Outside of the electricity 
sector, TI's energy markets are expected to stabilize further."
"We expect 
stable to improved development in the pipeline, downstream and other 
oil and gas-related markets, mainly in connection with a shift in supply 
from Russia to European countries, as well as the accelerated 
electrification of industry."
"Supply market environment 
The subdued forecasts for the overall economic environment are 
primarily due to higher interest rates, while material shortages are also 
likely to slow down economic development."
"In fiscal year 2024, the 
commodities market is expected to be strongly influenced by the 
development of the Chinese economy and the megatrend of decarboni-
zation."
"Investment-promoting measures in connection with climate 
neutrality targets and other purposes, e.g."
"in Europe the EU's ""Recovery 
and Resilience Facility"", the European Chips Act and the ""European 
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism"", are expected to have an 
increasing impact starting in 2024 and drive electrification in transport-
tation and heavy industry."
"This will increase the demand for specific 
materials."
"In addition, there will be a need for certain components in 
connection with the expansion of production capacities required to 
meet this demand."
"As a result, the availability of certain materials such as copper, rare 
earths, and semiconductors is expected to be limited in fiscal 
year 2024."
"Additional restrictions on metals are likely to result, for 
example, from political influence through tariffs and export bans."
"It can 
also be assumed that this situation will be exacerbated by limited new 
mining projects and primary smelting capacities, particularly for copper."
"Despite a general decline in the propen-
sity to invest due to the deterioration in financing conditions, we 
assume that the market environment will remain favorable for 
Siemens Energy, particularly due to the energy transition."
"Overcoming 
the energy trilemma - ensuring a sustainable, affordable and secure 
energy supply at the same time - remains the determining factor."
"We 
assume that Siemens Energy will be able to benefit from this situation 
in a similar way to fiscal year 2023."
"We also assume that the situation in the procurement markets will 
generally continue to ease compared to the structural challenges of 
prior years."
"Nevertheless, we expect general cost increases and material 
shortages in specific areas, e.g."
"We expect that we will 
be able to adequately manage such costs."
"We believe that 
Siemens Energy will be able to pass on most inflation-related cost 
increases in new contracts with customers and limit material shortages 
by taking appropriate countermeasures, such as through new suppliers."
"2.7.2 Strategic development, 
including solving operational issues 
With the new corporate structure effective since the beginning of the 
past fiscal year, the acquisition of the outstanding shares in 
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A."
"and the subsequent delisting 
in fiscal year 2023, we have created the structural basis for the 
consistent strategic development of Siemens Energy."
"We intend to 
achieve cost synergies of up to €300 million yearly within three years 
after full integration of Siemens Gamesa, mainly through better project 
execution as well as optimization of the supply chain."
"There will also be 
joint research and development efforts."
"We also are convinced that the 
current operational problems at Siemens Gamesa, especially the quality 
issues in particular of the 4.X and 5.X onshore turbines (see 2.3.2 
Events and developments responsible for the course of business), 
can be overcome more quickly under these conditions."
"We expect the root cause analysis for the quality issues identified in the 
past fiscal year to be completed during the first half of fiscal year 2024."
"This may lead to adjustments of the expected failure rates and might 
have material negative effects on net assets, financial position and 
results of operations."
"We assume that the temporary interruption of 
sales activities for the 4.X and 5.X onshore turbines will be lifted once 
the root cause analysis and the cause elimination has been completed."
"Irrespective of this, we are continuing general measures to increase the 
competitiveness of Siemens Gamesa with the ""Mistral"" program."
"The 
measures focus on a streamlined product portfolio, optimization of the 
global production footprint and operational activities as well as 
strengthening processes and controls."
"In addition, the ""Accelerating Impact"" program will contribute to the 
sustainable improvement of our operating performance until fiscal 
year 2025."
"The implementation of measures already agreed will lead to 
a reduction in our cost base and structural operational improvements."
"We expect our plans and measures in this regard to be implemented 
successfully."
"This relates in particular to the resolution of the 
operational problems at Siemens Gamesa."
"The book-to-bill 
ratio should remain above 1."
"It is assumed that around €8 billion of the 
order backlog at the end of the past fiscal year will result in revenue in 
fiscal year 2024."
"GS assumes comparable revenue growth of between 
negative 4% and 0% and a Profit margin before Special items of 
between 9% and 11%."
"Despite a decline compared to the past fiscal year primarily due to a 
decline in the volume of large orders, GT expects orders to remain at a 
high level."
"It is assumed that around €8 billion of the order backlog at 
the end of the past fiscal year will lead to revenue and thus account for 
the majority of the anticipated revenue; among other things, the large 
grid connection and expansion orders from fiscal years 2022 and 2023 
will lead to revenue."
"GT expects that the margin of the order backlog to 
be processed and, due to a higher volume, degression effects to have a 
positive impact on Profit."
"GT plans to achieve comparable revenue 
growth of between 18% and 22% and a Profit margin before Special 
items of between 7% and 9% in fiscal year 2024."
"In view of the expected market environment, the TI segment is 
assuming an increase in order intake, with profitability continuing to 
take priority."
"We foresee growth in revenue that will be driven by order 
intake in the past fiscal year."
"Around €4 billion from the order backlog 
at the end of the past fiscal year is expected to turn into revenue in fiscal 
year 2024."
"Profit is expected to improve, boosted by the assumed 
growth in revenue and the margins in order backlog."
"Overall, TI is 
assuming comparable revenue growth in a range of 8% to 12% and a 
Profit margin before Special items of 5% to 7%."
"The business performance of the Siemens Gamesa segment in fiscal 
year 2024 is likely to be determined by the existing internal challenges."
"Orders in the onshore business are expected to be significantly 
impacted by the temporary interruption of sales activities for the 4.X 
and 5.X onshore turbines."
"In the offshore business, orders are likely to 
be slowed down by delayed contract placements and selective order 
acceptance."
"The development of revenue is expected to remain largely 
unaffected by this, as it will be determined by the processing of the 
existing order backlog."
"Around €10 billion from the order backlog at the 
end of the past fiscal year is expected to convert to revenue in fiscal 
year 2024."
"The project margins burdened by higher planned costs due 
to the quality issues as well as the increased product costs and 
challenges during the ramp-up in the offshore area in the past fiscal 
year are expected to be decisive for the development of profit."
"For fiscal 
year 2024, Siemens Gamesa expects comparable revenue growth of 0% 
to positive 4% and negative Profit before Special items of around 
€2 billion."
"Outside the segments, we expect for Reconciliation to Consolidated 
Financial Statements a negative Profit at the level of the past fiscal 
year."
"As of September 30, 
2023, our order backlog amounted to €112 billion."
"We expect that the 
processing of our order backlog will support the recognition of total 
revenue at around €29 billion."
"Based on the expected development of profitability for our segments, 
we anticipate a Profit margin before Special items of between negative 
2% and positive 1% for Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2024."
"We assume that the expected profitability and, above all, disposals and 
an accelerated portfolio restructuring will lead to Siemens Energy 
generating a Profit after tax of up to €1 billion in fiscal year 2024."
"Expected financing and planned capital 
expenditures 
For Siemens Energy's Free cash flow pre tax, we assume a negative 
turnaround in fiscal year 2024 compared to the past fiscal year."
"We 
expect a negative Free cash flow pre tax of around €1.0 billion."
"This 
expectation takes into account our assumption regarding the 
continuation of order intake, which supported the development of Free 
cash flow pre tax in the past fiscal year due to the resulting customer 
prepayments."
"For fiscal year 2024, we also anticipate a very strong 
increase in capital expenditure in intangible assets and property, plant 
and equipment affecting Free cash flow pre tax compared to fiscal 
year 2023."
"In addition, we expect cash inflows outside Free cash flow pre tax in the 
range of €2.5 billion to €3.0 billion in fiscal year 2024 from disposals 
and accelerated portfolio restructuring."
"An essential element of these 
measures is the sale of a significant portion of our stake in Siemens 
Limited, India, to Siemens AG."
"With the Spin-Off from Siemens in fiscal 
year 2020, Siemens Energy received a 24% stake in the listed company."
We intend to sell an 18% stake in Siemens Limited to Siemens AG.
Siemens Energy will retain a 6% stake.
"The intended disposals and 
portfolio restructuring will generate a cash inflow of €2.1 billion."
"Including all measures from disposals and portfolio restructuring, this 
should result in a swing from net debt in the past fiscal year to net cash 
in fiscal year 2024."
"Overall assessment of expected developments 
We expect the global economy to grow at a subdued pace in the coming year."
"However, the conditions in our direct market environment, the 
energy market, are likely to be more important for the development of our business activities."
"We assume that overall conditions will remain 
favorable, particularly in connection with the energy transition, likely benefiting our GS, GT and TI segments."
"In addition, the focus in fiscal 
year 2024 will be on solving our issues at Siemens Gamesa."
"The forecast is based on 
the assumptions for our Business Areas set out below."
"Overall assumptions per Business Area 
• GS plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of negative 4% to 
0% and a Profit margin before Special items of 9% to 11%."
"• GT plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 18% to 22% 
and a Profit margin before Special items of 7% to 9%."
"• TI plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 8% to 12% and 
a Profit margin before Special items of 5% to 7%."
"• Siemens Gamesa expects a comparable revenue growth of 0% to 
4% and a negative Profit before Special items of around €2 billion."
"Actual developments may differ from our forecasts due to the risks and 
opportunities described in 2.8 Report on the internal control and risk 
management system and material risks and opportunities or in the 
event that our assumptions do not materialize."
"They do not 
provide absolute assurance but do provide a degree of assurance that 
the Company's business objectives are being met and that material risks 
are being appropriately addressed and mitigated."
"This includes, for 
example, that the Company’s assets are safeguarded, that financial 
reporting is reliable, and that legal or regulatory requirements are 
complied with."
"The internal control and risk management system is 
based on an ongoing process aimed at identifying and prioritizing risks 
to the achievement of business objectives and at addressing these risks 
effectively and efficiently."
"This includes the establishment of control 
objectives, the regular review of risks and control objectives, and the 
review of the achievement of control objectives and the adequacy and 
effectiveness of significant controls designed to mitigate risk."
"It provides a clear and consistent 
list of control objectives, enabling management and employees to 
exercise 
appropriate 
control in 
their 
respective 
areas of 
responsibility."
"A modified approach applies to our segment 
Siemens Gamesa, as only control objectives related to specific 
mandatory areas predefined by Siemens Energy are binding for 
Siemens Gamesa."
"Additional 
Siemens Gamesa-specific 
control 
objectives are defined and applied based on Siemens Gamesa 
management's own risk analysis."
"In the course of the further 
integration of Siemens Gamesa, it is planned to align the RCF of 
Siemens Energy and Siemens Gamesa as far as possible."
"The control objectives contained in the Risk and Control Framework 
form the basis for the annual assessment."
"Any internal control 
deficiencies identified through this process are evaluated and 
appropriate remediation actions are initiated by management."
"Among other things, this process also includes sustainability-related 
control objectives, such as the correct presentation of sustainability-
related financial data as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"In the course of the further inte-
gration of Siemens Gamesa, the use of a common IT solution is 
planned in order to also have access to Siemens Gamesa's data at 
any time and to be able to evaluate it for Siemens Energy."
"The results 
of the overall internal control process are regularly reported to the 
Executive Board."
"• Internal certification process: A quarterly certification process is in 
place that requires the management of all companies and selected 
units to confirm internally the accuracy, completeness and compli-
ance of financial reporting for their respective areas of responsibility."
"This process forms the basis for the responsibility statement of the 
Executive Board of Siemens Energy AG and for the representation 
letters of the Executive Board of Siemens Energy AG to the external 
auditor."
"Furthermore, there are 
clear responsibilities and procedures for managing these risks."
"The 
identification and management of risks are embedded in the day-to-
day management of our business."
"In addition, it complies with ISO standard 31000 “Enterprise 
Risk Management” (2018) issued by the International Organization 
for Standardization."
"• Compliance Management System: Our Siemens Energy Compliance 
System is divided into three levels of action: prevent, detect and 
respond."
"Preventive measures include compliance risk management, 
policies and procedures, and comprehensive employee training and 
counseling."
"Siemens Energy has implemented a whistleblower 
system and appointed an ombudsperson to receive information 
about compliance violations."
"To identify and resolve misconduct,

Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
Siemens Energy conducts internal investigations, compliance risk 
analyses, in-process controls and regular and ad-hoc audits."
"Appro-
priate responses follow any detected misconduct."
"The compliance 
management system is continuously updated to adequately address 
risks arising from changes in market conditions and business 
activities."
"• Internal Audit performs independent reviews of specifically selected 
audit areas based on an audit plan of identified risk areas of 
Siemens Energy AG and its affiliates."
"It reports regularly to the 
Executive Board and Audit Committee."
"• Legal and Compliance ensures, among other things, the consistent 
implementation of the Siemens Energy Business Conduct Guidelines 
and the related guidelines and controls on anti-corruption, antitrust 
law, data protection, anti-money laundering and export control."
"The 
Group Compliance Officer reports quarterly to the Executive Board 
and the Audit Committee of Siemens Energy AG on key figures and 
essential elements of the compliance management system, 
including significant developments in compliance cases."
"As part of 
the compliance management system, compliance-related control 
objectives have been defined in the Risk and Control Framework to 
support the organization in reporting and managing corresponding 
risks and in monitoring the effectiveness of internal control in this 
area."
"In addition, following the product quality issues at Siemens Gamesa 
communicated in June 2023, measures were initiated to review the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk 
management system."
"The audits described have not led to any findings that 
call into question the appropriateness and effectiveness of the 
Siemens Gamesa internal control and risk management system as a 
whole."
"Based on the above information, it is investigated whether a critical 
internal control weakness could exist."
"Critical internal control 
weaknesses are either individual internal control weaknesses that have 
been identified with critical effects or groupings of similar internal 
control weaknesses that may have critical effects in their entirety."
"A 
single definition of a critical internal control weakness is not possible."
"Deciding whether a particular weakness or group of weaknesses falls 
into this category is a matter of judgment."
"In the ERM process, we operate a systematic management of risks and 
opportunities which is integrated into the entire business organization."
"The Executive Board defines the business strategy and thus the Group-
wide risk policy and risk tolerance with the aim of managing risks and 
opportunities appropriately."
"This includes the execution of mitigation 
measures to reduce the potential impact of risks on the Company to an 
appropriate level."
"To the best of our knowledge, as of 
September 30, 2023, there is no material issue that threatens the 
achievement of key business objectives (strategic, operations, financial, 
compliance, climate) that has not been adequately addressed through 
our ERM process."
"Combined Management Report 38 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
Our accounting-related internal control system is based on the COSO 
framework “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” (2013)."
"In 
addition, our ERM process is linked to our internal control system via 
the COSO standard ""Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with 
Strategy and Performance"" (2017)."
"Both systems complement each 
other."
"At the end of the fiscal year, our management assesses both the 
appropriateness and the effectiveness of the control system in place 
based on all available information."
"For this purpose, we have a 
standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, 
documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested 
regularly for their appropriateness and effectiveness."
"Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of a 
centrally issued conceptual framework which primarily consists of 
uniform financial reporting guidelines in line with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and a chart of accounts."
"The 
need for adjustments to the conceptual framework due to regulatory 
changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis."
"Accounting departments are 
informed quarterly about current topics and deadlines from an 
accounting and closing process perspective."
"The base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the 
closing data reported by the operations of Siemens Energy AG and its 
subsidiaries."
"The preparation of the closing data of most of our entities 
is supported by external shared services organizations."
"Furthermore, 
other accounting activities, such as governance and monitoring 
activities, are usually bundled on a regional level."
"In certain cases, such 
as valuations relating to post-employment benefits, we use external 
experts."
"The reported closing data is used to prepare the financial 
statements in the consolidation system."
"The steps necessary to prepare 
the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated 
controls."
"Qualification of employees involved in the accounting process is 
ensured through appropriate selection processes and training."
"As a 
fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the “four 
eyes” principle applies, and financial statement information must 
undergo certain authorization processes."
"Additional control mecha-
nisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the 
composition of and changes in individual line items, both in the closing 
data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"In line with our information security requirements, 
accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting 
them from unauthorized access."
"The manual and system-based control 
mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling 
the IFRS closing data to the Annual Financial Statements of 
Siemens Energy AG."
"On a quarterly basis, we execute an internal certification process."
"Our Siemens Gamesa segment is also subject to our Group-wide 
principles for the accounting-related internal control and risk 
management system and is individually responsible for adhering to 
those principles."
"The management of Siemens Gamesa provides 
periodic sign-offs to the Executive Board of Siemens Energy AG, 
certifying the effectiveness of their respective accounting-related 
internal control systems, as well as the completeness, accuracy, and 
reliability of the financial data reported."
"In the course of the further 
integration of Siemens Gamesa, a complete adaptation of the certifyca-
tion process for Siemens Gamesa to the Siemens Energy standard 
process is planned."
"Our internal audit function is set up to review, among other things, 
financial reporting integrity, the effectiveness of the control and risk 
management systems, and adherence to our compliance policies."
"Regular reports are made to the Executive Board and Audit Committee 
on the results of the audits and the agreed remedial action in the event 
of findings."
"Our Siemens Gamesa segment has its own internal audit 
department and annual audit plan."
"The audit procedures for these topics will be 
generally executed in joint teams from our and Siemens Gamesa’s 
internal audit functions."
"The Audit Committee is integrated into our internal control and risk 
management system."
"In particular, it oversees accounting and the 
accounting process and the effectiveness of the internal control, risk 
management and internal audit systems."
"In addition, it is possible to submit accounting-related reports when 
there are complaints relating to compliance, e.g., anonymously and 
directly via the “Speak Up” system or via an ombudsperson."
"2.8.3 Risk management 
Basic principles of risk management 
Our risk management policy stems from a philosophy of increasing the 
enterprise value while managing appropriate risks and opportunities 
and avoiding inappropriate risks."
"As risk management is an integral part 
of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our Group-wide 
risk management policy is set by the Executive Board."
"Our 
organizational and accountability structure requires the respective 
management of our organizational units to implement risk 
management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and 
responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy."
"Enterprise risk management process 
The risk management system at Siemens Energy builds on a 
comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented enterprise risk 
management (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organization 
and addresses both risks and opportunities."
"Our ERM approach is based 
on the COSO Standard “Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with 
Strategy and Performance” (2017) and ISO Standard 31000 “Enterprise 
Risk Management” (2018) and has been adapted to Siemens Energy 
requirements."
"The frameworks connect the ERM process with our 
financial reporting process and our internal control system."
"Our ERM process aims for early identification, evaluation, and response 
to risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement 
of our strategic, operational, financial, compliance, and climate-related 
objectives."
"The time horizon is typically three years, and up to 30 years 
for climate-related risks and opportunities."
"We take a net risk approach, 
addressing the risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of 
existing control measures."
"Our ERM process is designed to ensure that 
the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about 
significant risks in a timely manner."
"If risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the 
Consolidated Financial Statements (e.g., as a provision or risk 
contingency), they are incorporated with their financial impact in the 
individual entity’s business objectives."
"As a consequence, only 
additional risks arising from the same subject (e.g., deviations from 
business objectives, different impact perspectives) are considered."
"Reporting generally follows quarterly cycles but we complement this 
periodic reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process, which aims to 
escalate critical issues in a timely manner."
"Relevant risks and opportu-
nities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering 
different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and 
regulatory requirements."
"Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant 
opportunities and risks, with the hierarchical level of responsibility 
depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity."
"Our 
general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, 
transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk."
"Our general 
response strategy with respect to opportunities is to fully “seize” the 
relevant opportunity."
"We regularly review our risk-bearing capacity on the basis of internal 
and external indicators in order to identify at an early stage any 
developments that could endanger our ability to continue as a going 
concern."
"In order to allow for a 
meaningful discussion at Group level, this organization aggregates 
individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature 
into broader risk and opportunity topics."
"This aggregation naturally 
results in a mixture of risks/opportunities, including those with a 
primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative 
risk/opportunity assessment."
"Accordingly, we do not adopt a purely 
quantitative assessment of risk/opportunity topics."
"Thematic risk and 
opportunity assessments then form the basis for the evaluation of the 
company-wide risk and opportunity situation."
"The Head of Risk 
Management and Internal Control reports quarterly to the Executive 
Board on matters relating to the implementation, operation, and 
oversight of the risk and internal control system and assists the 
Executive Board in reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory 
Board."
"Our ERM aims to identify relevant business risks throughout the 
organization as potential deviations from corporate objectives."
"The 
management of each of our defined organizational reporting units is 
responsible for providing all relevant risks for the respective unit."
"This is taken into 
account in the ERM process to the extent that it affects the risks and 
opportunities in the various areas assessed, e.g., in relation to corporate 
sustainability, EHS, supply chain or financing activities."
"2.8.4 Risks 
Below we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect 
on our business situation, financial position (including effects on assets, 
liabilities, and cash flows), results of operations, and reputation."
"The 
order in which the risks are presented in each of the five categories 
reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens Energy 
associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the risk’s 
current importance to us."
"Additional risks not known to us or that we 
currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business 
objectives and operations."
"Unless otherwise stated, the risks described 
below relate to all our reportable segments."
"Strategic risks 
Political instability and conflicts - As we are a globally operating 
Group, the imposition of barriers to free trade would negatively impact 
production costs and productivity along our value chains, as well as 
reduce the level of investment activity."
"Our business prospects and the 
execution of projects awarded to us may be negatively affected by 
political instability or international conflicts."
"Some of our current and planned projects and service activities are in 
regions, that are exposed to a higher risk in this respect e.g., in Ukraine, 
Libya, and Near and Middle East (see e.g., the Israel-Palestine conflict)."
"Furthermore, our business prospects or the processing of our order 
backlog may be negatively affected by changes in the political and 
economic framework, e.g., due to trade wars, punitive tariffs, 
sanctions, protectionist measures, or boycotts."
"We 
continuously 
monitor 
all 
relevant 
geopolitical 
developments to identify and assess potential risks to the 
Siemens Energy business in good time."
"With the Ukraine war and the 
resulting significant impact on our business, not only in this region, we 
are intensifying our monitoring capabilities and linking their results 
even more closely to our daily business activities."
"Combined Management Report 40 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
Market and price development - The worldwide markets for our 
products, solutions and services are highly competitive."
"Factors such as 
pricing, product and service quality, product development and 
introduction time, customer relationships, financing terms and the 
ability to adapt quickly to shifts in market demands and trends play an 
important role in this market environment."
"Changing energy prices and 
availability may lead to shifts in investments and alter the demand for 
our products and solutions."
"These developments are influenced by 
climate-related market transitions, macro-economic changes, and 
unforeseen geopolitical developments like the Russian war in Ukraine."
"Inflation may require that we increase prices to cover our own costs and 
maintain profit levels or it may increase the risk of lower profitability if 
we are unable to increase our prices."
"We face strong established 
competitors and new competitors from emerging markets (e.g., Asia), 
where many of them have developed their offerings locally and are now 
expanding globally."
"Industry fields in which we operate may undergo 
consolidation, which may result in stronger competition or a change in 
our relative market position."
"Decreasing demand for our offerings as a 
result of a weaker market position could lead to increases in inventories 
of finished goods or work-in-progress or to unexpected price erosion."
"In the future, our Siemens Gamesa segment may face additional 
competition from other manufacturers that might decide to enter 
global wind turbine markets."
"This may result in price decreases and/or 
a loss of market share for our Siemens Gamesa segment."
"In our service 
business, we face competition from major established players and non-
OEM suppliers targeting our turbine service business, which is a major 
source of profitable revenue."
"Some of these developments may prompt 
us to revise our strategy and product portfolio and there can be no 
assurance that such realignment will yield the intended results."
"If the 
Group is unable to compete effectively against its competitors or 
achieve satisfactory prices in negotiations with customers, this could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and 
results of operations."
"We 
continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market and industry 
information, in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in 
the competitive environment rather than merely react to such changes."
"Technology/ portfolio gap compared with competitors - The markets 
in which we operate are experiencing rapid and significant changes due 
to the introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies to meet 
the accelerating demand for sustainable (green) energy."
"Our operating 
results have in the past depended and will continue to depend to a 
significant extent on our ability to meet the evolving needs of current 
and prospective customers in a timely manner, to anticipate and adapt 
to changes in our markets, and to optimize our cost base accordingly."
"We do this by continuously creating new intellectual property as well as 
actively managing our intellectual property portfolio to secure our 
technological position."
"This could lead to 
reduced activities in certain markets."
"In our rotating equipment 
business, there is a risk of being unable to keep pace with the rapid 
changes in the market across the entire gas turbine portfolio given the 
high development costs and risks and uncertainties of the technologies 
needed in the future."
"This relates not only to the constant drive toward 
higher efficiencies but also to the need to decarbonize and increase 
operating flexibility."
"Furthermore, the pace of technological change 
may result in the economic lifecycle of certain of our products being 
shorter than anticipated as well as operating hours being reduced due 
to greater renewable capacity and generation around the world."
"There is also a risk that certain markets do 
not mature to a relevant size so we may not be able to recoup our 
investments."
"Impairment of goodwill and other assets - A significant share of our 
total assets as presented in our consolidated statements of financial 
position reflects the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible 
assets."
"The 
amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately 
as a charge to our results of operations."
"We may not realize the full 
value of our goodwill or other intangible assets in the future."
"Any 
determination of impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, 
and results of operations."
"This risk is partly influenced by external 
factors we have no influence on e.g., interest rates, or macroeconomic 
development."
"Internally, our business areas strive to adhere to their 
respective business plans in order to mitigate the risk."
"Further, the 
goodwill impairment buffer is being regularly monitored, and a regular 
annual impairment testing is taking place as well as monitoring on a 
quarterly basis."
"Requirements arising from ESG (environment, social, governance) 
standards - It is important for Siemens Energy to take a leading position 
in the area of sustainability in the industry."
"We may not be successful in identifying and adequate-
ly assessing all relevant requirements to meet stakeholder or public 
expectations on ESG standards, which could negatively impact our 
reputation."
"At the same time, compliance with certain ESG standards, 
in particular environmental standards, may lead to additional costs and 
challenges in our business."
"Besides our own efforts to comply with ESG 
requirements, we also face other ESG related risks such as a risk of 
insufficient funding or procurement of other financing instruments and 
other financial services."
"Our ability to 
realize projects in the energy industry, whether conventional or 
renewable, may be negatively impacted by ESG standards, which may 
have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial 
position, and results of operations."
"In this context, we create trans-
parency on ESG performance for stakeholders by producing our 
sustainability report or participating in relevant ESG ratings, and 
continuously monitor current and emerging regulations."
"Furthermore, 
we have defined a process for identifying critical projects early to 
ensure mitigation actions are identified and implemented in a timely 
manner."
"Operational risks 
Technical and quality issues - Certain products that we sold in the past 
had, and may in the future have, quality issues resulting from the 
design or manufacture of these products or the commissioning of these 
products or the software integrated into them."
"Such risks are 
particularly present in our engineering, production, and project sites, 
which are located all over the world and have a high degree of 
organizational and technological complexity."
"A failure or malfunction 
of one of our products may extend to other products or may affect 
whole production facilities or plants or entire product lines, which may 
already be installed or planned to be installed at customer sites."
"Potential consequences of quality issues could result in the shutdown 
of power plants, shutdown of wind farms, delays in project 
commissioning, property damage, customer claims, and detrimental 
effects on our reputation."
"Any of the described cost-
increasing effects, claims, liabilities, or reputational damages would 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and 
results of operations."
"In our Siemens Gamesa segment the risks of 
technical problems and quality incidents affecting the entire fleet or 
parts of a fleet cannot be completely excluded in the future either."
"The 
introduction of new platforms in Onshore and Offshore together with 
the factory capacity ramp-up could lead to increased Nonconformity 
Costs and execution delays."
"In addition, existing accruals may not fit to 
changing failure rates due to the long contract time of service contracts."
"Furthermore, addressing identified technical and quality-related 
problems could take longer than expected and cause higher costs than 
originally assumed due to greater complexity."
"To mitigate the 
aforementioned issues, action items are being implemented and 
monitored through e.g., cross-functional task force, weekly work-
streams and Steering Committee."
"Regarding new bids, critical serial 
defect clauses are under review by legal and our contractual position 
with suppliers will be strengthened."
"Siemens Gamesa is further 
focusing on an ambitious cost-out program."
"Business interruption due to cyberattack - Information technologies 
(IT) are deeply integrated into our business portfolio, and we depend 
on their uninterrupted and efficient functioning."
"Furthermore, we rely 
on third-party IT service providers, suppliers and vendors."
"The global 
increase in cybersecurity threats and higher levels of professionalism in 
cybercrime pose a risk to the security of products, systems, and 
networks."
"Our IT environment could be compromised, e.g., by 
advanced persistent attacks on our own or our IT service providers’ 
networks, which may also include externally hosted cloud services."
"There can be no assurance that our own or our IT service providers’ 
measures aimed at safeguarding the uninterrupted and efficient 
functioning of IT will address all of these threats under all circum-
stances."
"Any such attack or disruption may adversely affect our business 
operations."
"Risks from cyberattacks on our products and services can 
have particularly serious consequences because they are often part of 
critical infrastructure, the limited functionality or total failure of which 
can have far-reaching consequences."
"For example, we sell products and 
systems with digital capabilities and offer digital solutions such as 
instrumentation and controls for power plants."
"If such products, 
systems, and solutions are compromised or disrupted, we may be held 
liable by our customers for damages and may also suffer damage to our 
reputation."
"Cyberattacks and other disruptions could also result in 
deliberate improper access and use of our sites or systems, as well as 
production downtimes and supply shortages, with potential adverse 
effects on our reputation, our competitiveness, and results of 
operations."
"Further-
more, serious financial losses caused by a cybersecurity breach or 
cyberattack are considered by our cyber insurance policy that covers not 
only our company's first party loss, but also partly cyber liability (third 
party claims)."
"Supply chain risks - The financial performance of our operating units 
depends on reliable and effective management of our supply and 
logistics chain for components, parts, materials and services."
"Capacity 
constraints and supply bottlenecks resulting from ineffective manage-
ment of the supply and logistics chain could lead to production 
bottlenecks, delivery delays, additional inventory requirements, and 
additional costs."
"Third-party manufacturing, assembly, and functional 
testing of our products may reduce our immediate ability to influence 
quality assurance, delivery schedules, and costs."
"Unexpected increases 
in component or raw material prices due to market bottlenecks or other 
reasons could also adversely affect our results of operations."
"Since the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we have faced ongoing 
supply chain challenges and disruptions."
"Added to this are the increasing number 
of unforeseeable events (such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes), 
and an increased risk of supplier insolvencies and cyber incidents at our 
suppliers."
"In order to identify risks at an early stage, initiate measures 
to minimize risks, and ensure material availability in our production 
facilities, customer projects and service business, we have introduced 
systematic supply chain risk and resilience management."
"Since the start 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis management system and various 
task forces have also been established at top management level to 
manage the particularly challenging situation."
"With the support of the 
experts in our market intelligence team and various forecasting tools, 
we try to identify developments in the markets and supply chains at an 
early stage and take action as early as possible."
"However, the longer the 
global crises and the geopolitical conflicts continue, the more difficult 
it will be to manage and mitigate all potential risks."
"In addition to the 
challenges in material availability, we have been confronted for some 
time with material and raw material prices and logistics costs at a higher 
level."
"Costs due to inadequate delivery quality and the long 
development and qualification times for alternative suppliers due to the 
high complexity of our products represent a further risk."
"We have 
introduced several measures to improve quality and prevent losses."
"The 
increased use of quality management tools improves transparency, 
enables us to strengthen root cause analysis, and serves as a preventive 
Combined Management Report 42 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
measure."
"We continuously monitor our suppliers and supply chains to 
identify trends at an early stage and initiate countermeasures."
"Siemens Gamesa risks related to project execution - The 
Siemens Gamesa business is characterized by long-term contracts, 
carried out in and outside Europe."
"Possible risks from cost changes are 
cushioned by contractually fixed indexing, contractual risk allocation 
and/or calculated risk evaluations."
"Numerous already confirmed long-
term contracts, however, in particular in the offshore segment, contain 
fixed prices."
"We try to cover existing and potential further cost increases 
by renegotiating these contracts."
"These mechanisms mainly cover 
personnel and material cost changes."
"Productivity measures are aimed 
at further risk reduction."
"They include product cost improvement 
(mainly by reducing purchase prices for supplier parts/materials), 
factory and footprint optimization, effectiveness in operations and 
project execution, and quality enhancements as well as overall fixed 
cost reductions."
"Beyond this, technical product risks cannot be 
excluded, but they shall be successively reduced through adjustments 
to contractual terms and conditions (also through successful 
renegotiations)."
"This includes risk-adequate caps on liquidated 
damages as well as a liability limitation for Siemens Gamesa regarding 
these technical risks."
"Siemens Gamesa cost out savings - Our Siemens Gamesa segment 
has introduced the Mistral productivity program."
"The program includes 
many activities running in parallel, taking different approaches and 
targeting short-, medium-, and long-term improvements."
"These include 
restructuring through the introduction of a project- and process-
oriented operating model, increasing sales prices in conjunction with 
more selective bidding, adjusting contract clauses, and stabilizing the 
supply chain and production rate."
"In the event that the expected cost 
savings from synergy and productivity measures are not fully realized 
in a timely manner, this lack of productivity improvements or failure to 
achieve cost reductions could result in a material impact on 
Siemens Gamesa's profitability."
"Ongoing remedial actions include 
regular analysis of projected cost savings (including evaluation of 
reasons for deviations), as well as continuous development of existing 
productivity measures and the creation of new ones (including 
consideration of the degree of implementation)."
"Data leakage due to cyberattack - The confidentiality and integrity of 
our data, as well as that of our customers and business partners, are 
essential to our business operations."
"Modern cyberattack methods 
often not only lead to business interruptions, but confidential or private 
data, including that of third parties, is simultaneously exposed, stolen, 
manipulated, or otherwise compromised through data leaks."
"These 
risks are further exacerbated by the fact that potential attackers are 
increasingly sophisticated and are often supported by organized crime 
or even nation states engaged in industrial espionage or sabotage."
"If 
information relating to our intellectual property rights is leaked or 
stolen, this could adversely affect our competitive position and 
technology leadership."
"The leakage of information on current project 
terms or pricing structures may represent a direct short- to medium-
term impact on revenue."
"Our digital products and services process and 
store data from our customers and business partners."
"This includes 
particularly sensitive data that is essential, for example, for the security 
of energy networks."
"If this were to be compromised, this could have a 
particularly negative impact on our reputation as a service provider for 
critical infrastructures."
"In addition, if confidential or private data or data 
of third parties were compromised, we might have to pay contractual 
or regulatory penalties or face other sanctions in connection with non-
disclosure agreements or data protection laws and regulations."
"Mitigation of these risks include targeted protection measures for our 
IT systems, networks, and products and services based on the criticality 
of their data and business processes."
"This is complemented by 
programs for classifying data, monitoring data flows, and ultimately 
targeted prevention of data outflows, which we carry out in close 
cooperation with our IT and specialized service providers."
"Since the 
human factor often plays a decisive role in these attack scenarios, we 
support our employees with targeted training measures and recurring 
campaigns to increase awareness of the correct handling of data."
"If 
financial losses incur because of data privacy and confidentiality 
breaches, these are covered by our cyber insurance policy."
"Risks related to project execution (excluding Siemens Gamesa) - We 
regularly engage in large and complex projects up to full turnkey 
delivery that may be worth, or even exceed a value of, several hundred 
million euros and whose execution may take several years."
"These 
contracts are exposed to risks, which are identified and evaluated for 
every projects."
"Nevertheless, we may see deviations from our execution 
plan and its related calculated cost."
"This is particularly true in projects 
with untested or new technology or when we bid for projects in 
countries where we lack or have only limited experience based on 
previous projects."
"Further-
more, pandemic, geopolitical and climatic developments may constitu-
te additional risks."
"This may result in considerable increases in project 
expenses, adversely impacting project performance, and causing a 
substantial unfavorable effect on our business, financial position, and 
results of operations."
"In some cases, this also could lead to a legal 
dispute."
"In order to 
mitigate the risk of continued elevated attrition rates, Siemens Gamesa 
is working on an action plan with senior management."
"Measures 
include harmonization of Siemens Gamesa and Siemens Energy 
conditions for employees and the integration project with a focus on a 
smooth integration of Siemens Gamesa Corporate Functions into 
Siemens Energy."
"Current and future EHS laws and regulations, or amendments, may 
require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in 
significant increases in our operating or production costs."
"EHS programs establish a 
global framework that sets high-level standards and expectations, 
43 
Combined Management Report 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
including principles, behaviors, and essentials for environment, health 
and safety."
"We could also face liability for damage or remediation for 
environmental contamination at the facilities we own, lease, design, or 
operate."
"This risk is further exacerbated by the fact that much of the 
real estate used by Siemens Energy was acquired when such real estate 
had already been in industrial use."
"Siemens Energy therefore cannot 
guarantee that such real estate was always operated in line with EHS 
regulations, but may, nevertheless, be held responsible for the 
consequences of a failure to do so."
"We may incur environmental losses 
beyond the insurance limits, or outside the coverage of such insurance, 
and such losses may have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial position, and results of operations."
"Unavailability of key personnel - We currently experience a favorable 
order intake in our business areas GS, GT and TI."
"At the same time, the 
competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel remains intense 
for many talent segments and regions in which our businesses operate."
"The lead time for hiring and onboarding might delay project execution 
activities and could potentially impact business operations and 
customer satisfaction."
"We try to provide sufficient recruiting capacity, 
also via third-party providers, supported by recruiting campaigns as well 
as targeted candidate approaches."
"Based on strategic workforce 
planning of the businesses, targeted measures can be initiated, such as 
building up in growth areas, deriving and implementing retraining and 
qualification measures."
"Financial risks 
Credit Rating downgrade to sub investment grade - There is a risk of 
adverse financial performance that is not commensurate with key 
financial ratios and performance indicators needed to maintain the 
rating BBB- by our credit rating agency S&P Global."
"A one notch 
downgrade to our investment grade rating to BB+ (non-investment 
grade) could result in severely limited financial flexibility, increased 
financial costs and significant restrictions e.g., covenants, collateral."
"Capital market capacity would reduce with substantially higher costs of 
funding and a narrower investor base."
"Access to capital markets could 
even be completely shut in times of market volatility."
"Banks could end 
their relationship with Siemens Energy."
"Many banks might stop issuing 
guarantees and parent company guarantees would have a lower 
acceptance level."
"In order to mitigate the risk of a downgrade, 
Siemens Energy has announced measures to strengthen its balance 
sheet through portfolio divestments (e.g., Trench and Siemens Ltd., 
India)."
"In addition, we are in continual dialogue with S&P Global to keep 
them abreast of all the measures we are taking to maintain an 
investment grade credit rating profile."
"Our ability to obtain financing, 
guarantees, or hedging instruments from financial institutions on 
commercially acceptable terms, could depend on several factors 
beyond our control."
"In turn, this could have a 
material adverse effect on our growth prospects, our competitive 
position and our business, financial position, and results of operations."
"Due to the global scale of our business, our results of operations are 
affected to a significant extent by volatility in foreign exchange rates, 
interest rates, and commodity prices."
"Indebtedness taken on by 
our Siemens Gamesa segment/Group companies could limit the ability 
of Siemens Energy as a whole to borrow funds or to have access to 
hedging/guarantee lines, and vice versa."
"Our business activities could 
be negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not have access 
to financing on economically viable terms."
"Furthermore, we may incur 
unexpected losses on financial instruments if the credit quality of our 
contractual partners deteriorates or if they default on, or fall behind 
schedule with, their payment obligations to us, arising from trade 
receivables."
"Financial institutions demand representations in financing 
contracts regarding compliance with sanctions or other export control 
measures."
"Failure to comply with sanctions and other control regimes 
may adversely impact our financing ability."
"We believe these risks, 
including ESG risks, are particularly relevant with a view to our oil and 
gas and conventional power generation activities and will make the 
financing for such projects more difficult in the future."
"Furthermore, 
there can be no assurance that Siemens Energy will be able to maintain 
adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the 
future, which may have a negative effect on our financial position and 
results of operations."
"The provisions for pensions and similar obliga-
tions may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, including 
life expectancy and discount rates."
"Actual developments may differ 
from prior assumptions, e.g., changing market and economic 
conditions, and may therefore result in an increase/decrease in the 
actual obligations."
"Fluctuations in the financial markets or a change in 
the portfolio mix of plan assets may result in a significant increase/de-
crease in the fair value attributable to plan assets over time."
"A 
significant increase in underfunding may have a negative effect on our 
capital structure, rating, refinancing and costs."
"If legal conditions 
governing our pension obligations are subject to changes in relevant 
legislation, we may incur new or more extensive pension obligations in 
the future."
"Furthermore, we may face the risk of increasing cash 
outflows if local pension regulations require higher funding levels."
"For additional information related to the use of financial instruments, 
please see Note 20 Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
activities and Note 21 Financial risk management in 3.6 Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Compliance risks 
Impact of legal proceedings - Siemens Energy is, and potentially will 
be in the future, involved in several administrative, legal, and arbitra-
tion proceedings in various jurisdictions."
"Such proceedings may, among 
other things, relate to claims from or against project partners and 
customers regarding delays and disruptions, non-performance, labor 
disputes, antitrust issues, product liability, warranty claims, and IP 
rights."
"The significance and outcome of these proceedings can vary 
greatly and many of these cases could have considerable negative 
consequences for us."
"These proceedings could result in Siemens Energy 
being subject to, e.g., payment of contractual penalties or damages 
Combined Management Report 44 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
(including punitive damages), equitable remedies or sanctions, fines, or 
disgorgement of profit."
"In individual cases, legal disputes may also lead 
to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or refusal 
to renew or grant business licenses or permits."
"High-profile proceedings 
may also divert management attention, result in significant litigation 
and arbitration costs, negative publicity, and harm our reputation."
"In 
some cases, our reputation may suffer regardless of the merits of the 
claim and the outcome of the proceedings."
"We maintain liability 
insurance for certain liability risks at levels our management believes 
are appropriate and consistent with industry practice."
"However, 
Siemens Energy may incur losses relating to legal proceedings beyond 
the limits, or outside the coverage, of its insurance, or exceeding any 
provisions made for losses related to legal proceedings."
"For additional information related to specific litigations, please see 
Note 18 Legal proceedings in 3.6 Notes to the Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements."
"Potential compliance violations - As a diversified company with global 
businesses we are exposed to various product- and country-related 
regulations, laws, and policies influencing our business activities and 
processes."
"We monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our 
key markets to anticipate potential problem areas, with the aim of 
quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed 
conditions."
"However, any changes in regulations, laws, and policies 
could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as 
our financial position and results of operations, for example, through 
the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia."
"Siemens Energy conducts a large 
share of its business with governments and government-owned 
enterprises."
"We also participate in a number of projects funded by 
government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational 
organizations, such as multilateral development banks."
"Ongoing or 
potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust 
violations, or other violations of law could also impair relationships with 
such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts."
"Such 
investigations may also adversely affect existing private business 
relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic 
projects and transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or 
other business alliances."
"In addition, third parties, including our compe-
titors, could initiate significant litigation."
"Furthermore, we might be 
exposed to compliance risks in relation to recently acquired operations 
that are in the process of integration."
"Along with other measures, we 
have a state-of-the-art global compliance organization in place to 
mitigate these risks, which conducts, among other things, compliance 
risk mitigation processes such as comprehensive compliance trainings, 
compliance risk assessments, and internal audit activities."
These changes will be gradual over several years or decades.
"In 
particular, the trend towards decarbonization of the energy market has 
a significant impact on the strategy, organizational setup and portfolio 
of Siemens Energy."
"There is a risk that requirements will be driven in a 
much shorter timeframe than expected by regulatory measures or 
public pressure (e.g., CO₂ taxes, financing restrictions for greenhouse 
gas emitting technologies, media campaigns)."
"To mitigate related tech-
nology/ portfolio risks and ensure timely actions, we are continuously 
screening market developments and reviewing our portfolio."
"The 
products, solutions and services offered by our business areas Gas 
Services and Transformation of Industry serve, to a significant extent, 
conventional power generation using fossil fuels."
"Fossil power 
generation is currently under pressure due to the prevailing trend 
toward more sustainable power generation using renewable energy 
sources or carbon-neutral fuels."
"In addition, the trend towards 
decentralization may adversely impact markets for centralized power 
generation, including gas power plants and related power grids, e.g., 
high-voltage substations."
"If we are too slow or if we fail to adapt our 
business model and our product portfolio to specific regional demand 
in time or at all, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial position, and results of operations."
"There is a risk that the 
demand for fossil power plants and related infrastructure including 
highly efficient gas turbines will be lower than we expect due to a faster 
than expected transition toward renewables."
"An accelerated growth in 
new installations of solar and wind power due to their declining 
levelized cost of energy could result in decreasing demand for con-
ventional power generation."
"Also, a faster than expected development 
of competitive energy storage solutions could accelerate the change 
toward renewables by offsetting their disadvantage of not being able 
to respond flexibly to varying energy demands."
"These trends could result in fewer orders for new power 
plants, oil & gas products or solutions, or other industrial applications."
"Consequently, our service business might suffer from fewer opportuni-
ties to conclude new service contracts."
"Also, our service backlog may be 
adversely affected if customers decide to decommission conventional 
power plants, other assets or to cancel or postpone modernizations."
"Within renewables, we are offering wind power applications through 
our Siemens Gamesa segment, but we have only limited products and 
services related to solar power generation or other renewable techno-
logies in our portfolio."
"If other renewable fields develop more 
dynamically than expected, e.g., through increasingly declining subsidy 
levels in the wind power industry, there can be no guarantee that 
Siemens Gamesa will succeed in addressing the resulting challenges."
"Moreover, in this case, fewer orders could affect our service business."
"We are offering our customers various pathways to transform their 
existing fleet of fossil fuel-based power generation technology into a 
less carbon-intensive one."
"Depending on governmental policy support 
and regulatory implementation, such markets may pick up earlier or 
later than expected."
"If we are too slow or if we fail to adapt our business 
model and our product portfolio to specific regional demand in time or 
at all, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
position, and results of operations."
"We are constantly screening for 
climate-related developments, e.g., decarbonization programs of our 
customers, investor requirements, regulatory frameworks, and identify-
ing critical projects through a sustainability check to determine risk 
exposure."
"45 
Combined Management Report 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
Assessment of the overall risk situation 
The most significant challenges are described first in each of the five 
risk categories – strategic, operations, financial, compliance, and 
climate."
"The risk arising from technical and quality issues is the most 
significant challenge for us, following the critical supply chain risk in the 
previous year."
"At present, no risks have been identified that either individually or in 
combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern."
"2.8.5 Opportunities 
Within our ERM, we also regularly identify, evaluate, and respond to 
opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity."
Below we describe our most significant opportunities.
"Unless otherwise 
stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units."
"The order in which the opportunities are presented reflects the 
currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens Energy associated 
with these opportunities and thus provides an indication of the 
opportunities’ current importance to us."
"The opportunities described 
are not necessarily the only ones we encounter."
"In addition, our assess-
ment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our 
markets, and technologies are constantly advancing."
"It is also possible 
that opportunities we see today will never materialize."
"We have placed one 
single listed company as the head of the Group."
"This is expected to 
result in lower communication, management and reporting costs by 
reducing the costs and complexity inherent in maintaining a listed 
company."
"Also, we could 
improve the efficiency in supplier relations and the unified manage-
ment of larger purchasing volumes, facilitating further cost savings 
while improving the Group’s ability to cope with supply chain 
disruptions."
"These, together with further integration measures could 
generate estimated synergies of up to €300 million per year on a run-
rate basis within three years after full integration."
"Several initiatives 
form the basis for this estimation, such as supply chain and logistics 
synergies from integrating the purchasing activities as well as the 
service and logistics networks."
"We reduce total expenditure through 
joint and integrated R&D efforts and an optimized administrative setup, 
including the centralization of certain administrative functions and 
harmonization of IT systems."
"Furthermore, we concentrate on project 
execution excellence through improved project selection and bidding, 
the proven expertise of Siemens Energy in managing large and complex 
projects and the introduction of a more project-focused organizational 
structure."
"On top of the cost synergies, the company expects additional 
growth-related revenue synergies in the mid-triple digit million range 
by the end of the decade through a joint go-to-market approach and a 
fully integrated energy technology offering with a focus on value-added 
capabilities."
"Based on the revenue and cost synergies we expect to 
obtain due to the implementation of the targeted integration initiatives 
and under a unified management, we strive for an overall improved 
financial profile of the Siemens Energy Group."
"Climate-related opportunities from markets - We see an opportunity 
from accelerating growth in markets driven by decarbonization and net-
zero emissions goals."
"All of our Business Areas may benefit from 
accelerated decarbonization, whether through greater demand for 
wind turbines, grid transmission equipment, hydrogen-capable gas 
turbines, industrial decarbonization solutions, electrolyzers, other 
Siemens Energy technologies, or new portfolio elements."
"Our ability to 
capture these market opportunities may be limited by our ability to 
expand production and supply chain capacities, or by the other risk 
factors facing our business generally."
"Climate-related opportunities from portfolio - We see the 
opportunity to significantly accelerate growth at Siemens Energy by 
developing a green product portfolio that meets the market trend 
towards net-zero emissions."
"We strengthen our decarbonization 
portfolio and grow markets short-, mid-, and long-term, while continu-
ously adapting our business models and our product, service and 
solution portfolio to changing customer and market behaviors."
"We accompany our customers on their energy transfor-
mation journey and continuously monitor and adapt our portfolio to 
meet customer needs."
"We closely observe the market and regulatory 
developments, with a focus on applications with earlier expected 
market maturity."
"In 
addition, selected technology fields have been defined and are being 
driven forward across the company to improve the sustainability 
dimension of our product, solution, and service portfolio and to 
strengthen our core business."
"We explore market opportunities to 
create the foundation for new business, e.g., focus on building up our 
H2-related business with electrolyzer systems and solutions for the 
production of green hydrogen on the basis of renewable energy and 
water."
"Our Siemens Gamesa segment’s wind power portfolio is another 
essential element on this path to clean energy and to transform the 
future."
"As part of the implement-
ation of the new operating model, the number of management 
positions has been reduced and a flatter hierarchy has been created, 
enabling a holistic sales approach and central project execution."
"This 
continuously will lead to more efficient structures, a unified customer 
approach, and a higher net promoter score."
"The Company is also aiming 
for a significant reduction in NCC (non-conformance costs), harmo-
nized processes and IT, more accountability, and faster decision 
making."
"In addition, transparency for the capital market should be 
increased through the clear market-oriented organizational structure."
"The growing global trend to decarbonization with 
several international initiatives might result in additional demand for 
our energy generation solutions (e.g., Oman, Qatar, United Arab 
Emirates, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Mexico, Chile)."
"Various 
regions are currently still suffering from civil unrest and/or financial 
distress and/or political instability and conflicts (e.g., Yemen, Iraq, 
Libya, Afghanistan, Ukraine)."
"Stabilization in any of these countries 
holds the opportunity for us to participate in the rebuilding and 
developing of local energy infrastructure."
"Assessment of overall opportunities  
As in the previous year, the most significant opportunity for 
Siemens Energy is the achievement of all synergies from the full 
integration of Siemens Gamesa as described above."
"Siemens Energy AG is the parent company of the Siemens Energy Group 
and acts as a strategic management holding company."
"Its results are 
significantly influenced by its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries."
"The business development of Siemens Energy AG is through its share-
holdings fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as 
the Siemens Energy Group."
"The outlook of the Group directly affects 
our expectations for Siemens Energy AG."
"Therefore, the foregoing ex-
planations for the Siemens Energy Group also apply for Siemens Energy AG."
"As part of its activities as a listed holding company of the 
Siemens Energy Group, Siemens Energy AG entered into service agree-
ments with Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co KG."
"These intercompany 
services result in the recognition of revenue and cost of sales."
"As of September 30, 2023, Siemens Energy AG employed 38 employees, 
including members of the Executive Board."
"Siemens Energy AG allows employees and members of the Managing 
Board to participate in share-based payment programs."
"For the purpose 
of servicing share-based payment programs, Siemens Energy AG also 
delivers Siemens Energy shares, which have been granted by affiliated 
companies."
"In fiscal 
year 2023, Siemens Energy AG re-issued in total 6,517,873 treasury 
shares under the exclusion of subscription rights in connection with 
share-based payments and employee share programs in the Group, 
equaling a nominal amount of €6,518 thousand and 0.8% of the capital 
stock."
"On December 23, 2022, Siemens Energy announced a share buyback 
with a volume of up to €130,000, ending September 30, 2023, at the 
latest."
"To carry out the share buy-back, €50,000 thousand was 
withdrawn from the reserve account of Siemens Energy Global GmbH 
& Co."
"KG 
by 
shareholder 
resolution."
"In 
fiscal 
year 2023, 
Siemens Energy AG repurchased a total of 6,573,037 shares, thus 
completing the share buyback program on May 18, 2023."
"This 
represents a nominal amount of €6,573 thousand or 0.82% of the ca-
pital stock as of September 30, 2023."
"For this purpose, €130,000 thou-
sand were spent excluding incidental transaction charges."
"This 
represents an average stock price of €19.78 per share."
"The voluntary cash tender offer announced on May 21, 2022, to 
acquire all outstanding shares of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy 
S.A."
"was publicly placed on November 8, 2022, and completed in fiscal 
year 2023."
"Effective July 12, 2023, the Siemens Energy Group and thus 
Siemens Energy AG as the parent company indirectly became through 
its subsidiaries the sole owner of the company, which has been 
operating as Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A.U."
"since Septem-
ber 7, 2023."
"Expenses incurred at the level of Siemens Energy AG for 
consulting services in connection with the acquisition of the 
outstanding shares were charged to Siemens Energy Global GmbH & 
Co."
"KG, the owner of the shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy 
S.A.U."
"(see also 2.3.2.2 Other events influencing the course of 
business)."
"The new, registered 
shares with no-par value were placed by way of an accelerated book-
building process at a price of €17.32 per share."
"Due to the capital 
increase on March 15, 2023, the difference between the issue price of 
€17.32 per share and the notional value of €1.00 per share was 
allocated to capital reserve."
"This increased the capital reserve by 
€1,185,885 thousand."
"The cash received in the course of the capital 
increase was passed on to Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."
"KG as 
part of an interest-free loan in the amount of €1,245,964 thousand for 
the purpose of acquiring the outstanding Siemens Gamesa Renewable 
Energy S.A."
"The Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance 
with Section 252 para."
"2 German Commercial Code on the 
assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern."
"The 
continuation of Siemens Energy AG as the parent company of the 
Siemens Energy Group is directly linked to the continuation of the 
Group."
"The Executive Board arrived at this premise following a compre-
hensive review of the Siemens Energy Group's liquidity development."
"The review included the liquidity available at the balance sheet date, 
cash flow forecasts in line with general business planning, available and 
undrawn credit lines, the Group's credit ratings and the maturity profile 
of existing financial debt."
"In addition, the Group's guarantee credit lines 
were also taken into account (see also 2.6.3 Financing and liquidity 
analysis)."
"The sharp increase was mainly due to the development of cost 
of sales, as management services are billed using the cost-plus 
method in accordance with the contractual terms."
"In addition, the 
volume of fees received from Group companies for guarantees given 
to customers in connection with the provision of services increased 
sharply."
"The fees received are only offset by a low amount of cost of 
sales."
"• Cost of sales essentially included personnel expenses resulting from 
the provision of management services to affiliated companies."
"The 
substantial increase was mainly due to the higher number of 
Management Board members and therefore increased associated 
expenses to be charged compared to the prior year."
"• General administrative expenses increased sharply due to higher 
expenses for purchased consulting services compared to the prior 
year."
"The purchased services were in connection with the acquisition 
of the outstanding shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A."
"• Other operating income (expenses), net decreased clearly and 
included other operating income in the amount of €29,717 thou-
sand (2022: €15,508 thousand) and other operating expenses in the 
amount of €15,308 thousand (2022: €144 thousand)."
"The sharp 
increase in other operating income resulted from higher income 
from the recharging of expenses to Group companies."
"The recharges 
mainly comprised expenses for consulting services in connection 
with the acquisition of the outstanding Siemens Gamesa Renewable 
Energy S.A."
"The equally sharp increase in other operating 
expenses was due to transaction costs of €15,185 thousand incurred 
in connection with the capital increase carried out on March 15, 
2023."
"• The sharp increase in financial income, net was mainly due to the 
income from investments."
"In fiscal year 2023, it included a with-
drawal from Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."
"KG in the amount 
of €68,343 thousand (2022: €17,305 thousand)."
"Thereof, an 
amount of €50,000 thousand (2022: €0 thousand) was used to carry 
out the buyback of treasury shares."
"A further amount of 
€18,343 thousand (2022: €17,305 thousand) was used for the with-
drawal in accordance with the provisions in the articles of association 
to ensure the recognition of income taxes in the balance sheet of 
Siemens Energy AG."
"• Income taxes included domestic and foreign income taxes and 
decreased substantially."
"The decrease was mainly due to tax income 
from the reversal of a provision for foreign income taxes in the 
amount of €618 thousand (2022: tax expense of €3,131 thousand) 
and higher receivables against tax authorities for capital gains tax in 
the amount of €3,898 thousand (2022: €2,267 thousand)."
"The 
withdrawal from Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."
"KG, which was 
reflected in the income (loss) from investments, accounted for 
expenses amounting to €18,343 thousand (2022: €17,305 thou-
sand)."
"The surplus of deferred tax assets was not recognized due to 
the exercise of the option under Section 274 para."
"2 German 
Commercial Code."
"5 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG)."
KG and Siemens Energy Management GmbH.
"• Receivables from affiliated companies increased sharply, mainly due 
to the granting of an interest-free loan to Siemens Energy Global 
GmbH & Co."
"KG in the amount of €1,245,964 thousand."
"The loan, 
which is to be repaid in full on March 22, 2024, was granted to pass 
on the issue proceeds from the capital increase on March 15, 2023, 
for the purpose of acquiring the outstanding Siemens Gamesa 
Renewable Energy S.A shares."
"Receivables from affiliated companies 
also included a receivable from Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."
"KG in the amount of €960,000 thousand (2022: €960,000 thou-
sand)."
"The receivable resulted from the fact that the proceeds 
received in the course of the mandatory convertible note issued by 
Siemens Energy Finance B.V., Zoeterwoude, Netherlands, were 
forwarded via two group-internal loans past Siemens Energy AG to 
Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."
"KG and are reported under 
receivables from affiliated companies until the mandatory converti-
ble note matures in September 2025."
"In addition, receivables from 
affiliated companies included receivables from cash pooling with 
Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."
"KG, which were primarily rela-
ted to share-based payments granted by affiliated companies."
"• Other assets mainly comprised receivables from tax authorities in 
the amount of €5,670 thousand (2022: €4,651 thousand)."
"The 
sharp increase resulted from an applied research subsidy of 
€3,000 thousand, which 
was 
recognized 
at 
the 
level 
of 
Siemens Energy AG, as the tax group parent."
"• Shareholders’ equity increased clearly by €1,258,549 thousand due 
to the capital increase carried out on March 15, 2023, and by 
€109,534 thousand due to the issue of treasury shares under share-
based payments and employee share programs."
"This was offset by 
the share buyback with a total volume of €130,000 thousand."
"• Provisions for pensions and similar commitments increased mainly 
due to regular service cost for employees."
"• Trade payables increased substantially mainly due to consulting 
services in connection with the acquisition of the outstanding 
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A shares not yet settled on the 
balance sheet date."
"• Other liabilities decreased significantly due to lower liabilities to 
personnel amounting to €17,564 thousand (2022: €18,395 thou-
sand) and due to reporting date lower sales tax liabilities to the tax 
authorities amounting to €16,772 thousand (2022: €24,210 thou-
sand)."
"The decrease of the sales tax liabilities at Siemens Energy AG 
as the sales tax group parent is due to the inherent fluctuations in 
the long-term project business of its tax group companies."
"In 
addition, other liabilities included outstanding Supervisory Board com-
pensation in the amount of €4,105 thousand (2022: €4,100 thou-
sand)."
"Opportunities and risks 
Siemens Energy AG’s business development is largely subject to the 
same opportunities and risks like the Siemens Energy Group."
"In this 
context, the opportunity and risk potential of Siemens Energy AG with 
respect to its subsidiaries and equity investments is generally 
proportional to the respective directly or indirectly held capital shares 
in each individual case, see 2.7 Report on expected developments."
"As 
the parent company of the Siemens Energy Group, Siemens Energy AG 
is included in the Group-wide risk management system, see 2.8.3 Risk 
management."
"Alongside the opportunities and risks of the Group, Siemens Energy AG 
is also exposed to the risk of impairment of investments in subsidiaries."
"As investments in subsidiaries represent nearly the entire total assets, 
this risk is of great importance for Siemens Energy AG."
"The recovera-
bility of investments in subsidiaries is influenced by the development 
and success of the subsidiaries and their investments."
"Adverse effects 
on subsidiaries or indirect investments may consequently lead to an 
impairment of the investment in subsidiaries in Siemens Energy AG’s 
Annual Financial Statements."
"Income from investments significantly 
influences the net income of Siemens Energy AG."
"Additionally, there is 
the risk of the guarantees and other commitments assumed for 
subsidiaries being utilized."
"Outlook 
Siemens Energy AG is the sole limited partner of Siemens Energy Global 
GmbH & Co."
"KG and holds all shares in the Siemens Energy Manage-
ment GmbH as its sole general partner."
"In this structure withdrawals 
from Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."
"KG, which Siemens Energy AG 
receives, will lead to income from investments for Siemens Energy AG, 
provided the fair value of Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."

tion, increased renewables, hydrogen technologies and Power-to-X 
technologies."
"Our mission is to support our customers in this transition 
to a more sustainable world, based on our innovative technologies."
"For a successful transition, a sustainable energy landscape is required 
which is based on renewables and a strong grid infrastructure, while 
leveraging low-emission conventional power for peak loads and 
reducing energy consumption by driving efficiency improvements in 
industry."
"Combining conventional and renewable energy systems is key 
to meeting the world’s need for sustainable, reliable and affordable 
energy."
"Targets 
We are committed to decarbonization in our supply chain, our own 
operations, and the use phase of our products, and aspire net zero GHG 
emissions across the value chain (Scope-1, -2 and -3) in line with a 1.5°C 
pathway."
"Siemens Energy (excluding Siemens Gamesa) aims to be climate 
neutral by 2030."
"This includes the reduction of absolute Scope-1 and -
2 GHG emissions by at least 46% by fiscal year 2025 (from a 2019 base 
year), which is even more ambitious than the original target year of 
2030, as validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."
"As part 
of 
the 
science-based 
target 
Siemens Energy 
(excluding 
Siemens Gamesa) committed to increase annual sourcing of renewable 
electricity to 100% by fiscal year 2023 and achieved this target."
"In 2021, 
the SBTi also validated the absolute GHG reduction targets for our sold 
products (Scope-3 category 11: 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year)."
"Combined Management Report 52 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
It confirms that these targets are in line with the Paris Climate 
Agreement."
"SBTi also verified that Siemens Gamesa’s GHG emission reduction 
targets (Scope-1 and -2) are aligned to meet the Paris Climate 
Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C."
"Siemens Gamesa 
achieved carbon neutrality in its own operations in 2019, including 
offsetting unavoidable emissions."
"In order to advance climate neutrality across the entire value chain, 
Siemens Energy is also working on concepts to reduce GHG emissions 
in the supply chain."
"We encourage our suppliers to take action to 
protect the climate."
"For Siemens Energy, we intend to reduce our 
relative Scope-3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services as 
well as from transportation and distribution by 30% per procurement 
volume (€ spent) by 2030 (from a 2018 base year)."
"Siemens Gamesa commits that 30% of its suppliers by spend covering 
purchased goods and services, and transportation and distribution, will 
have science-based targets (SBTi) by 2025."
"Measures 
The biggest lever for reducing GHG emissions is in our portfolio of 
products, solutions and services."
"• Transport and storage of electricity: 
We are developing new products, services and solutions for the 
transport and storage of electricity, thereby expanding our trans-
mission and hydrogen businesses."
"• Reducing GHG footprint and energy consumption in industrial 
processes:  
We are helping our process industry customers to decarbonize their 
brownfield facilities and ensure sustainable concepts for future 
installations."
"We are committed to monitoring progress on climate action and 
reducing exposure to climate related risks."
"Therefore, we conducted an 
analysis of future markets based on three scenarios, which include 
climate implications."
"Based on this analysis, the climate implications of 
our business planning until 2030 were evaluated for the base case 
scenario."
Emission reduction levers were evaluated and decided upon.
"Our research and development (R&D) activities are key to the 
development of the three strategic pillars."
"Essential elements in 
developing our broad range of innovative technologies are partnerships 
and collaboration both within Siemens Energy and with external 
partners."
"Siemens Energy (excluding Siemens Gamesa) established 
four Global Innovation Centers in Berlin (Germany), Orlando (USA), Abu 
Dhabi (UAE), and Shenzhen (China) to nurture innovation and business 
development to drive the energy transformation."
"These centers are set 
up to co-create with customers and partner with start-ups, industrial 
partners, and universities."
"R&D at Siemens Gamesa is focused on developing the next generation 
of technology that is designed to lead to improved and more cost-
effective products, solutions and services."
"In addition, Siemens Gamesa is exploring 
opportunities in adjacent business fields, including other renewable 
energy sources, hybrid parks and storage in order to deliver solutions 
for the system integration of renewables."
"Siemens Gamesa also 
collaborates on R&D initiatives for product and technology develop-
ment, partnering with universities, customers, competitors, suppliers, 
design consultants and certifying bodies."
"For more information about 
Siemens Energy´s innovative partnerships and cooperation please also 
refer to chapter 2.1.3 Research and Development and our Sustaina-
bility Report chapter H2 Customers and Innovation."
"Another focus area across all businesses is digitalization, e.g., 
technology-based services such as remote operations or remote 
services, resulting not only in better performance throughout product 
and equipment life cycles but also more efficient operation with lower 
emissions."
"In addition to transforming our portfolio, GHG reduction measures are 
focused on our own operations."
"The strongest levers for achieving 
climate neutrality are:  
• Reducing energy consumption, including substitution and efficiency 
measures, 
• Using renewable electricity, 
• Reducing SF6 emissions, 
• New mobility concepts."
Our suppliers are an important part of the value chain.
"Performance indicators 
Scope 3 emissions from the use of sold products 
Scope 3 downstream emissions make up more than 99% of the overall 
Siemens Energy carbon footprint and are calculated on the basis of the 
GHG Protocol Standards."
"The main drivers for GHG emissions are the 
direct combustion of fuels (e.g., natural gas) in our products and the 
electricity consumption and power losses of our products."
"The 
emissions include:  
• Direct emissions: GHG emissions are basically generated through the 
direct combustion of fossil fuels."
"The level of GHG emissions varies 
depending on product type, fuel type, and application mode."
"• Indirect emissions: GHG emissions are basically generated by large 
electrical consumers (e.g., motors, drives, pumps) or by power losses 
(e.g., transformers)."
"To a minor extent, the transmission portfolio 
emits CO2 equivalents (CO2e) via SF6 gas leakages at customers’ sites."

The calculation methodology for Scope-3 emissions comprises the 
emissions from products over their expected use-phase and the expec-
ted operating hours per year."
"With the order intake, the total level of 
related emissions is determined and reported."
"GHG emissions that 
occur during other phases of a product’s lifecycle, such as in the supply 
chain, production or end-of-life disposal, are not accounted for and 
reported in Scope-3 downstream."
"During the reporting period, total Scope-3 emissions from the use of 
sold products at Siemens Energy was 1.1 billion tons of CO2e."
"This is a 
decrease of 0.2 billion tons compared to fiscal year 2022, and a 
decrease of 27% compared to the base year 2019."
"There are several 
reasons for the decrease in absolute emissions, including: 
• Emissions decreased due to lower sold capacity (Megawatt) in 
central and distributed power generation."
"• Lifetime for power generation was adjusted (27 years in fiscal 
year 2023 vs."
"28 years in fiscal year 2022): While gas turbines have 
historically been powered by fossil fuels throughout their lifetime, 
this will change in the future."
"Many countries, including our most 
relevant customer markets, have committed to a net zero economy 
in 2050 and a net zero electricity system even earlier."
"This is why this 
change was included in the calculations for the first time assuming 
that the turbines sold will not run on unabated fossil fuels after 2050."
"• Operating hours for specific gas turbine frames used in central power 
generation decreased due to increasing penetration of renewable 
energy sources."
"We also considered H2 co-firing for 
the first time in fiscal year 2022."
"The impact is minor as we only consider H2 co-firing if the customers share a 
specific time plan for using H2 and indicate to what extent H2 is going to be used."
"2  Well-to-tank emissions are included (extraction, refining and transportation of the raw fuel sources, prior to 
combustion), biogenic emissions have been excluded."
"Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions from own operations  
Siemens Energy’s total energy consumption during the reporting period 
was 5.2 million gigajoules."
"Compared with fiscal year 2022, this is a 
decrease of 11%, which is partly attributable to the implementation of 
energy efficiency projects."
"In fiscal year 2023, renewable electricity accounted for 100% of 
Siemens Energy´s electricity consumption compared with 90% in fiscal 
year 2022."
"Our reporting software enables us to further increase the automated 
collection of actuals and reduce extrapolations."
"Over the reporting 
period, Siemens Energy collected the following data regarding the level 
of Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions related to its business activities: 
• Scope-1 (direct) emissions: Direct GHG emissions arise from energy 
sources in the company’s ownership or under its control."
"• Scope-2 (indirect) emissions: Indirect GHG emissions refer to the 
consumption of purchased electrical energy and district heating."
"During the reporting period, total Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions from 
own operations at Siemens Energy was 182 thousand tons of CO2e."
"This is a decrease of 33 thousand tons compared to fiscal year 2022, 
and a decrease of 59% compared to the base year 2019."
"– Bureau of 
Economic Analysis (BEA) and the U.S."
"and European environmental 
agencies applying a spend based method."
"The calculated emission intensity for Scope-3 emissions from purchased 
goods and services and transportation and distribution for fiscal 
year 2023 at Siemens Energy was 0.414 kg of CO2e/€ which is 8.3% 
lower compared to fiscal year 2022 and 18.6% lower compared to the 
base year 20181."
"2 
325 thousand tons of the 775 thousand tons CO2e emissions were calculated using a consumption-based 
method."

"This is mandatory in the sales phase of 
projects that meet defined risk criteria."
"In these activities, 
Siemens Energy relies on external environmental, social and governan-
ce (ESG) databases focusing on country-, customer- and project-related 
risks."
"The results of the due diligence including recommendations for 
any mitigation measures guide the project’s decision-making process."
"Any violations of human rights associated with our areas of influence 
can be reported via our grievance mechanisms, including communica-
tion channels such as our “Speak Up” reporting system and ombuds-
person."
"In fiscal year 2023 we published rules of procedure for the 
handling of complaints via our grievance mechanism on Siemens Energy’s 
global website."
"In addition, Siemens Energy is committed to preventing the use of 
minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas that impose a threat 
on human rights."
"Therefore, Siemens Energy implemented its Respon-
sible Minerals Sourcing Policy which follows the risk-based require-
ments of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance."
"To determine the use, 
57 
Combined Management Report 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
sources and origin of these minerals in our supply chains, we investiga-
te the smelters involved."
"Based on risk sources identified by the EU, which cover armed conflicts, 
weak governance and human right abuses, Siemens Energy identified 
other relevant minerals apart from tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold."
"After cobalt, copper and rare earths we added mica to our supply chain 
due diligence processes according to the 5-step framework of the OECD 
Due Diligence Guidance."
"In addition to our Responsible Minerals 
Initiative (RMI) membership (Member of RMI Steering Committee) and 
strategic partnership with the European Partnership for Responsible 
Minerals (Member of Governance Board), we are actively engaging as 
member of the Copper Mark."
"2.10.2.4 Anti-corruption and bribery matters  
Siemens Energy operates globally with customers from a wide range of 
industries in both the public and private sectors."
"Consequently, the 
company is confronted with a complex regulatory framework."
"Compliance with regulations and integrity are the foundations for all 
our decisions and activities."
"Siemens Energy top management supports 
this with a strong tone from the top, which is mirrored throughout the 
entire organization."
"Anti-corruption measures, combined with strong compliance systems, 
protect companies as well as their employees and shareholders from 
the possibility of misconduct."
"The elimination of bribery and corruption 
in all forms promotes fair competition, which benefits innovation-
driven companies like Siemens Energy."
"Moreover, it fosters economic 
growth and social development, to the benefit of entire countries, 
regions, and their respective citizens."
"The Siemens Energy approach to Compliance is based on three levels of 
action: “prevent, detect, respond”."
"These are grounded in management 
responsibility and are comprised of focus areas including Anti-
Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, Antitrust, Collective Action, Data 
Privacy, Export Control and Human Rights, all of which are reflected in 
our Business Conduct Guidelines."
"Siemens Gamesa has implemented its 
own compliance system and BCG that meet the standard of 
Siemens Energy."
"The Legal and Compliance Department falls directly under the purview 
of our CEO, with a direct reporting line."
"In addition, the 
Siemens Energy Group Compliance Officer has direct access to the 
Executive Board and Supervisory Board and reports regularly on 
Siemens Energy compliance matters."
"Compliance at Siemens Energy 
combines strong central governance with a global network of qualified 
compliance officers who ensure that the compliance system is 
implemented world-wide."
"These compliance professionals work closely 
with employees and managers who assume personal responsibility for 
compliance in their respective areas."
"Targets 
Siemens Energy maintains a zero-tolerance approach to compliance 
violations."
"This approach requires continuous effort to sustain and 
develop a holistic compliance system, consisting of measures to ensure 
that business is always conducted in accordance with the law, as well 
as our internal principles and rules."
"In this way, we seek to ensure that 
our values and reputation are protected."
"Measures 
We continuously adapt and improve our compliance system and tool 
landscape to mitigate challenges inherent in our business activities and 
those arising from changing market conditions."
"Preventive measures 
include Siemens Energy’s compliance risk management, compliance 
training program, and communication channels such as our “Speak 
Up” 
reporting 
system 
and 
ombudsperson 
(excluding 
Siemens Gamesa), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
“Integrity 
Hotline” 
at 
Siemens Gamesa."
"They also include our guidelines and procedures such 
as the Siemens Energy and Siemens Gamesa Business Conduct 
Guidelines (BCGs) which lay the foundation for our internal 
regulations."
"Collectively, these measures give expression internally to 
the values, compliance-related responsibilities, and behavioral 
framework for all managers, employees, and Executive Board members 
worldwide."
"Externally, for our business partners, compliance with our 
Code of Conduct focusing on legal compliance and anti-corruption is 
mandatory, including provisions to counter anti-competitive practices 
and conflicts of interest."
Siemens Energy maintains ongoing compliance awareness.
"Our global 
compliance training program targets all managers and employees in 
positions with a specific risk profile."
"Those selected are required to 
complete mandatory compliance training."
"It consists of instructor-led 
as well as e-learning courses and is continuously adapted to the 
changing risks facing our business."
"An integral part of our compliance approach is compliance risk 
management."
"For this measure, an assessment of compliance risks 
was conducted in fiscal year 2023."
"Identified risks were addressed 
through both local and central measures monitored through dedicated 
workshops."
"Performance indicators 
Siemens Energy responds to any alleged violation of external or internal 
rules in accordance with established company-wide processes."
"Once a 
compliance investigation has been completed and a compliance 
violation has been proven, we take appropriate disciplinary action."
"In 
such circumstances our internal processes provide guidance to ensure 
that proper actions are taken with those involved."
"Proportional 
consequences are evaluated and defined through established 
disciplinary processes."
"Moreover, the implementation of consequences 
is systematically monitored."
"2 
Numbers for disciplinary sanctions in a fiscal year do not necessarily correspond to cases reported during that 
period: Sanctions are frequently not implemented in the same year in which the case was reported or the 
investigation – that follows a defined process – was completed."
"In addition, a single case may result in multiple 
sanctions, or none at all."
"3 
Includes loss of variable and discretionary compensation components, transfer and suspension, but not the 
revocation of signatory rights."
"Based on the nature of our 
businesses, the environments in which we operate and the wide range 
of different geographical regions, we do not regard the number of 
Combined Management Report 58 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
incidents as unusual."
"With respect to disciplinary sanctions the 
disproportionate number of sanctions in fiscal year 2022 is mainly due 
to cases in Siemens Gamesa India."
"Siemens Energy is not aware that it has been convicted of any 
corruption, bribery, or antitrust violations in fiscal year 2023."
"To date, 
there have been no significant issues of non-compliance resulting in 
material monetary fines or non-monetary sanctions like the withdrawal 
of trading licenses or licenses to operate in highly regulated industries."
"2.10.2.5 EU Taxonomy 
The EU Taxonomy is a central component of the European Union’s 
Green Deal and Sustainable Finance Action Plan, which aim to achieve 
climate neutrality in the EU by 2050."
"To achieve the goals of the Green 
Deal, capital flows are to be directed specifically into sustainable 
projects and companies."
"Taxonomy-eligible econo-
mic activities can be assigned to one of the activity descriptions within 
the criteria catalog of the Taxonomy Regulation."
"All companies that are obliged to prepare a non-financial statement in 
accordance with Sections 289 b and 315 b of the German Commercial 
Code must include information on EU Taxonomy in their reporting."
"In fiscal year 2023, the reporting requirement also extends for the first 
time to the taxonomy-aligned shares of revenue, capital expenditures, 
and operating expenditures."
"In addition, the complementary delegated 
act (EU) 2022/1214 with regard to the recognition of specific economic 
activities in the area of natural gas and nuclear energy was applied for 
the first time."
"Due to the simplified approach in fiscal year 2022, there is no prior year 
information on taxonomy-aligned shares available."
"A prior year 
comparison of the total taxonomy-eligible shares is only possible to a 
limited extent due to the first-time application of the complementary 
delegated act on natural gas und nuclear activites."
"The EU Taxonomy contains formulations, terms and definitions that are 
currently partly subject to interpretation uncertainties and whose 
subsequent clarification by the EU could lead to changes in reporting."
"The portfolio of the Business Area GT is considered by Siemens Energy 
to be taxonomy-eligible under economic activity 4.9 based on a 
teleological interpretation."
"A portfolio such as that of the Business Area 
GT is an absolute prerequisite for meeting the requirements of a com-
plex and global network for the transmission and distribution of electri-
city."
"The respective products are individually designed according to 
customer-specific technical requirements and are part of tailor-made 
systems or solutions, both for high-voltage transmission and for the 
voltage levels of the distribution systems."
"GT offers a wide range of 
services that enable and ensure stable and efficient operation of the 
power grid (see also 2.1.2 Business model)."
"How-
ever, the terms ""construction"" and ""operation"" are not clearly defined in 
59 
Combined Management Report 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
the activity description."
"From Siemens Energy's perspective, given the 
GT business and in view of each of the activities identified in the tech-
nical screening criteria, these terms require an interpretation."
"In 
Siemens Energy's understanding, the term ""construction"" includes 
activities such as the creation of customer-specific designs, the manu-
facture and the installation of products and solutions."
"The term ""opera-
tion"" includes activities such as commissioning, maintenance, and 
retrofitting, which are necessary for the functionality and performance 
of an efficiently operating network."
"GT’s portfolio of products and 
services includes all these activities."
"Long-term service contracts in 
particular ensure continuous grid availability."
"Significant parts of the portfolio of the Business Area GS are considered 
to be taxonomy-eligible under natural gas-related economic activity 
4.29 by analog interpretation."
"For operators of electricity generation 
facilities that generate electricity from fossil gaseous fuels using gas 
and steam turbines, the offering by the GS Business Area is an absolute 
prerequisite."
"The offering includes the design, manufacture, 
installation and commissioning of gas and steam turbines as well as 
services (see also 2.1.2 Business model)."
"The highly complex turbines 
are individually manufactured for the operator and form the basis of the 
respective power generation facilities."
"GS ensures full functionality by 
providing support during installation and commissioning as well as 
accompanying services."
"The description of the economic activity 4.29 
requires the “construction or operation of electricity generation 
facilities that produce electricity using fossil gaseous fuels”."
"The terms 
“construction” and “operation” are not clearly defined in the activity 
description and require interpretation in view of the GS business."
"The 
understanding of the terms explained in the course of the interpreta-
tion of economic activity 4.9 also applies to the GS Business Area."
"During the “construction” phase, GS is responsible for the production of 
turbines and transportation, supervision of installation, commissioning, 
and functional testing."
"During commercial “operation” by the facility 
operator, GS supports the availability, reliability, and performance of 
the turbines."
"GS ensures functionality during the regular warranty 
phase and by means of long-term service contracts over the entire 
service life of a turbine."
"Siemens Energy’s economic activities that are currently not yet covered 
by the EU Taxonomy for fiscal year 2023 are generally reported as non-
taxonomy-eligible, although these economic activities may be in line 
with the EU's environmental objectives."
"Assessment of taxonomy alignment 
Substantial contribution criteria 
To be classified as taxonomy-aligned, the taxonomy-eligible economic 
activities identified by Siemens Energy first need to make a substantial 
contribution to climate change mitigation."
"Do no significant harm (DNSH) 
In addition, economic business activities may only be classified as 
taxonomy-aligned if they do no significant harm to the other 
environmental objectives."
"Whereby Siemens Energy corporate 
functions centrally provide governance and monitoring, the implemen-
tation and execution of the DNSH assessments is done by the Business 
Areas."
"Essential evidence for the adaptation to the impacts of climate change 
includes conducting climate risk assessments and deriving measures to 
address the identified climate risks for relevant Siemens Energy sites."
"These assessments are based on the Representative Concentration 
Pathway (RCP)-4.5 scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) with a time horizon until 2060, and the identi-
fied physical climate risks are analyzed and addressed in appropriate 
adaptation plans."
"The criteria regarding sustainable use and protection of water and 
marine resources are essentially implemented in our environmental 
management system with ISO 14001 certifications, which cover all 
relevant Siemens Energy sites."
"Implementation by the Business Areas is 
supported by our Zero Harm Framework and internal EHS guidelines."
"Siemens Energy's environmental management system is an essential 
component for environmentally sound waste management in produc-
tion and customer projects on-site."
"Life cycle analyses are carried out 
for the relevant portfolio elements, covering the requirements of the 
criterion for the transition to a circular economy."
"They also address the 
prerequisites for the sustainable use of materials and consumables."
"This also includes the check of substan-
ces whose use may be exceptionally permitted if they meet the criterion 
“essential use for society”, in accordance with EU Regulation 2021/2139 
Appendix C lit."
"The requirements for the protection and restoration of biodiversity and 
ecosystems are also integrated into our environmental management 
system and Zero Harm Framework."
"Environmental regulatory require-
ments and additional requirements from the DNSH criteria have been 
assessed and defined measures are implemented."
"The monitoring systems for the aforementioned requirements include 
an Integrated Management System with reporting and measurement of 
essential parameters, as well as internal and external audits."
"In addition to 
that, we conduct annual and ad hoc human rights and environmental 
risk analyses (see also 2.8 Report on the internal control and risk 
management system and material risks and opportunities)."
"The economic activity 4.29 Electricity generation from fossil gaseous 
fuels was identified as a significant taxonomy-eligible economic 
activity."
"However, only a small proportion of Siemens Energy's activities 
reported under economic activity 4.29 are taxonomy-aligned."
"The 
manufacture of gas and steam turbines and the associated services do 
not currently make a substantial contribution to climate change mitiga-
tion according the Taxonomy Regulation, as the required technical 
screening criteria are not met."
"The activities of Siemens Energy reported under the identified 
economic activity 4.3 Electricity generation from wind power are only 
partially taxonomy-aligned."
"An increase in 
taxonomy alignment is expected in the coming fiscal years."
"The economic activity 4.9 Transmission and distribution of electricity 
was identified as a significant taxonomy-eligible economic activity."
"The 
activities of Siemens Energy reported under economic activity 4.9 are 
for the most part taxonomy-aligned."
"Determination of taxonomy key indicators 
The taxonomy key indicators are based on the consolidated financial 
statement of Siemens Energy in accordance with IFRS."
"All fully consoli-
dated Group companies are included in this analysis."
"Revenue, capital expenditures, and operating expenditures were alloca-
ted to taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities on 
the basis of the information in the financial reporting systems."
"Various 
verification steps (including the documentation of data generation and 
the reconciliation with other financial information) prevent any double 
counting of economic activities."
"Revenues are classified in terms of their 
taxonomy-eligibility or alignment when the order is accepted, capital 
expenditures when the decision on the respective investment applica-
tion is made, and parts of the operating expenditures during regular 
R&D controlling."
"In 
fiscal year 2023, not all capital expenditures were included in the 
process for determining taxonomy-eligibility and -alignment and were 
therefore classified as non-taxonomy-eligible."
"For example, some 
decisions regarding investment applications were made in previous 
financial years and the associated capital expenditures made in the 
current fiscal year were not allocated in full retrospectively."
"As a result, 
capital expenditures that may be taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-
aligned are reported as non-taxonomy-eligible in fiscal year 2023."
"An 
increase in taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned capital expendi-
tures is therefore expected for the coming fiscal years."
"The revenue reported in the consolidated income statement of 
Siemens Energy amounted to €31,119 million in fiscal year 2023 
(2022: €29,005 million, see also 3.1 Consolidated Statements of 
Income)."
"€22,834 million (2022: €16,613 million) revenue was taxo-
nomy-eligible, which corresponds to a share of 73.4% (2022: 57%)."
"Thereof, €11,678 million of revenue were additionally taxonomy-
aligned in fiscal year 2023, representing a share of 37.5%."
"Capital expenditures under the EU Taxonomy are based on additions 
to tangible and intangible assets during the fiscal year (before 
depreciation and any revaluations for the respective fiscal year), 
including those resulting from business combinations."
"Expenditure on 
acquired goodwill is not included, while acquired rights of use arising 
from leases are to be included in the EU Taxonomy key figure."
"For fiscal year 2023, total capital expenditures to be considered 
according to the EU Taxonomy amounted to €1,813 million 
(2022: €1,573 million, see also 3.6 Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Note 10 Other intangible assets and property, plant 
and equipment)."
"€1,308 million (2022: €1,239 million) capital 
expenditures were taxonomy-eligible, which corresponds to a share of 
72.2% (2022: 79%)."
"Thereof, €924 million capital expenditures were 
additionally taxonomy-aligned in fiscal year 2023, representing a share 
of 51.0%."
"The taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures are essentially 
related to additions to property, plant and equipment."
"For fiscal year 2023, total operating expenditures to be considered 
according to the EU Taxonomy amounted to €1,321 million 
(2022: €1,309 million)."
"€1,098 million (2022: €530 million) operating 
expenditures were taxonomy-eligible, which corresponds to a share of 
83.1% (2022: 40%)."
"Thereof, €534 million operating expenditures 
were additionally taxonomy-aligned in fiscal year 2023, representing a 
share of 40.4%."

"Siemens Energy is one of the largest suppliers of technology in the 
energy and electricity sector, serving the entire scope of the energy 
market."
"It provides a portfolio in both conventional and renewable 
energy along the entire energy value chain, from power generation to 
power transmission, complemented by a comprehensive set of training 
and service offerings, aimed at both the public- and private sector."
"The GS portfolio includes products, solutions, 
and services for central and distributed power generation."
"The 
business is focused on servicing the installed fleet of gas and steam 
turbines."
"The wide-ranging service portfolio includes maintenance, 
performance enhancements, operation services, digitalization (e.g., 
cybersecurity), and professional consulting."
"• The activities of the Grid Technologies (GT) Business Area are as a 
reportable segment focused on the key market trends of 
electrification, decarbonization, and digitalization."
"The products, 
systems, solutions, and services offered by GT overcome the 
challenges arising from the increasing complexity of the grid 
infrastructure as a result of integrating renewable energy and the 
trend toward distributed energy generation."
"The Business Area’s activities are focused primarily on reducing 
energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in industrial 
processes."
"Thus, TI is supporting industrial customers in reducing 
their carbon footprint and achieving their individual decarbonization 
targets."
"Its portfolio includes integrated systems and solutions for 
various process industries (e.g., oil and gas, chemicals, petro-
chemicals, and fibers), as well as for the shipping industry."
"The TI 
portfolio includes electrolyzers, industrial steam turbines with an 
output of up to 250 MW, industrial generators, turbo and reciproca-
ting compressors, compressor trains, systems and solutions, as well 
as service offerings for the entire portfolio."
"• The Siemens Gamesa Business Area as a reportable segment offers 
onshore and offshore wind turbines as well as services over the 
entire lifecycle of wind turbines."
"The service business consists of the 
management, operation and maintenance of wind farms."
"Siemens Gamesa comprises the Wind Turbines (Onshore and Offsho-
re) as well as Operation and Maintenance (Service) business field."
"The other central 
items include license fees for the Siemens brand, central services 
(e.g., management of the Group real estate portfolio (excluding 
Siemens Gamesa), which was formerly assigned to the GP segment), 
central projects and investments, as well as other items."
"At the beginning of fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITA margin before 
Special items was also replaced by Profit margin before Special items."
"Profit is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, interest income 
and expenses, and other financial income (expenses), net, adjusted for 
amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
and goodwill impairments."
"Special items refer to the following topics: 
• Restructuring and integration costs: Restructuring costs refer to 
personnel measures leading to severance charges, including costs 
for terminating service contracts with Siemens Group (Siemens AG 
and its subsidiaries)."
"Due to the further integration of 
Siemens Gamesa and the objective of a consistent presentation 
within the Group, only personnel-related measures for restructuring 
will be included for Siemens Gamesa from fiscal year 2023, in 
contrast to the past."
"Integration costs that occur at Siemen Gamesa 
are related to the integration of companies as well as in the course 
of the integration of Siemens Gamesa into the Group and the corres-
ponding transaction costs."
"• Stand-alone costs relate to the separation from Siemens Group and 
the formation of Siemens Energy as an independent enterprise."
"• Major asset impairments and write-downs (as well as any sub-
sequent reversals) related to strategic portfolio decisions."
"For both Profit margin and Special items, prior year information is 
presented on a comparable basis."
"In addition, the prior year figures in Note  2 Debt relating to potential 
outflows from arising from lease extension options and in Note 27 
Related party transactions relating to leases between related parties 
have been adjusted."
"The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the 
assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern."
"The 
Executive Board arrived at this premise following a comprehensive 
review of the Group's liquidity development."
"The review included the 
liquidity available at the balance sheet date, cash flow forecasts in line 
with general business planning, cash inflows from portfolio measures, 
available and undrawn credit lines, the Group's credit ratings and the 
maturity profile of existing financial debt."
"In addition, the Group's 
guarantee credit lines were also taken into account (for more details, 
see Note 21 Financial risk management)."
"Such critical accounting estimates could change 
from period to period and have a material impact on the net assets, 
financial position, and results of operations of Siemens Energy."
"Critical 
accounting estimates could also be based on estimates where 
Siemens Energy reasonably could have used a different estimate in the 
current accounting period."
"Siemens Energy cautions that future events 
often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require 
adjustment."
"In fiscal year 2023, there were significant changes to assumptions and 
estimates, particularly in the Siemens Gamesa segment."
"The greatest 
impact resulted from an exceptionally negative development in the 
component- and platform-specific failure rates of wind turbines."
"The 
estimate for such failure rates is derived from a statistical model."
"This 
model was updated based on the data obtained as part of an extended 
technical review."
"As a result, the failure rates for the affected compo-
nents, in particular main bearings and rotor blades, have increased 
sharply."
"In addition, expected costs for preventive measures, retro-
fitting and contractual compensation, e.g."
"for availability, were 
recognized."
The resulting expenses amounted to €2.1 billion.
"For pro-
jects already handed over to customers the expense is reflected in the 
warranty provisions as well as in planned cost increases of service 
contracts, which lead to adjustments to contract assets and liabilities 
and, in some cases, in the provisions for onerous contracts."
"For ongoing 
projects, on the other hand, the planned costs increase, which leads to 
adjustments to contract assets and liabilities and, in some cases to the 
recognition of provisions for onerous contracts."
"The expected failure rates are then 
linked to cost and quantity data of operational factors (e.g."
"working 
hours, ship/crane days, required tools and spare parts with the 
associated costs) for any necessary maintenance/repairs."
"In addition, a 
technical assessment based on a root cause analysis is carried out to 
determine the extent to which the issues relate to individual cases or 
the entire fleet."
"The statistical model is based on numerous parameters, 
such as technical assumptions, experience gained from many years of 
operating wind turbines, meteorological conditions and information 
about suppliers."
"The assumptions required for the model are subject to 
estimation uncertainties."
"Based on past experience particularly in fiscal 
year 2023, it is possible that actuals within the next fiscal year deviate 
from the assumptions as a result of new findings from the not yet 
completed root cause analysis of the quality issues identified in fiscal 
year 2023."
"This may result in material negative effects on net assets, 
financial position and results of operations."
"We are of the opinion that 
the process described above and the underlying parameters led to the 
best possible estimate of warranty costs as of the balance sheet date."
"We have commissioned an independent external technical expert to 
evaluate the statistical model for determining the failure rates; the 
preliminary results from the first indicative investigations confirm our 
assessment."
"This development was reflected on the one hand in the 
provisions for onerous contracts, in particular for projects for which 
binding offers were made, and on the other hand in the contract assets 
and liabilities of ongoing projects."
"The changed business outlook for Siemens Gamesa had an impact on 
the assumptions and estimates for the impairment test of goodwill and 
non-current assets."
"In addition, the above had also an impact of around €0.8 billion on the 
measurement of deferred tax assets, as their realizability no longer 
appeared sufficiently certain."
"Further information can be found in Note 6 Income taxes, Note 7 
Contract assets, liabilities and revenues, Note 9 Goodwill and 
Note 14 Provisions in the notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"In addition, the Management Board has changed its assessment of the 
further progress of the Accelerating Impact program (AIP) restructuring 
program due to improved market conditions and volume growth."
"Further information can be found in Note 23 Personnel costs in the 
notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Ongoing political instability and conflicts continue to pose a significant 
geopolitical risk, resulting in complex uncertainties with negative 
effects on the availability and price development of materials, energy 
or supplier products, including their logistical capacities."
"The resulting 
effects can primarily affect production costs, pricing, product and 
service quality, investment activities, customer relationships, financing 
conditions and market requirements and trends."
"To counter geo-
political risks, competitive, market and industry data and developments 
are continuously monitored and analyzed in order to better anticipate 
changes instead of merely reacting to them."
"This information is taken 
into account when determining cash flows, discount rates, recoverable 
amounts of assets and provisions, among other things."
"However, a 
renewed deterioration of the situation with corresponding effects on 
the net assets, financial position and results of operations cannot be 
ruled out."
"With regard to the war in Ukraine, there were no material 
actual effects on Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2023."
"The macroeconomic environment in fiscal year 2023 was primarily 
characterized by the effects of the initially maintained zero COVID-19 
policy in China, the uncertainties due to the war in Ukraine and the 
development of interest rates and inflation."
"These factors have been 
considered in the critical accounting estimates and have a particular 
impact on the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers, 
employee benefits, and financial instruments, as well as on the asset 
impairment testing."
"Siemens Energy assumes that technical equipment and 
machinery will be used over their entire planned economic life and can 
generate corresponding benefits for the company, so that the remain-
ing useful lives used as a basis adequately reflect the economic use."
"Furthermore, as a globally active company, Siemens Energy assumes 
that the achievement of certain climate targets is subject to regional 
differences."
"For example, not all countries worldwide are currently 
committed to the strict EU climate targets."
"Accordingly, Siemens Energy's 
global customers are at different stages of maturity in the energy 
transition and have different technological requirements."
"Moreover, 
part of Siemens Energy's product portfolio can already be operated with 
other fuels."
"This applies in particular to hydrogen, which is especially 
important from a climate perspective."
"In addition, some of the technical 
equipment is also used for longer-term service contracts."
"Assumptions 
related to climate change and decarbonization trends and their impact 
on Siemens Energy's business development are screened constantly by 
the Company."
"The consequences of the geopolitical and regulatory environment 
require complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions 
that may be subject to change over time."
"Siemens Energy believes that the assumptions applied appropriately 
reflect the current situation."
"In addition to the aforementioned explanations, further critical 
accounting estimates are mentioned in the sections on material 
accounting policies."
"Basis of consolidation – The Consolidated Financial Statements 
include the accounts of Siemens Energy AG and its subsidiaries over 
which the Company has control."
"Control exists when Siemens Energy 
has power over the investee."
"In addition, Siemens Energy is exposed to, 
or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the investee 
and Siemens Energy is able to use its power over the investee to affect 
the amount of the Company’s return."
"Business combinations – The cost of an acquisition is measured at the 
fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the 
date of exchange."
"Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in 
a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the 
extent of any non-controlling interest."
"Non-controlling interests are 
measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed (partial goodwill method)."
"If there is no loss of control, 
transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity 
transactions not affecting profit and loss."
"At the date control is lost, any 
retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value."
"In case of a written put option on non-controlling interests, the 
Company assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present 
ownership interest are fulfilled at the reporting date."
"If the Company is 
not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the 
exercise of the put option will be assumed at each reporting date and 
treated as an equity transaction between shareholders with the 
recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price."
"The 
non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the 
reporting period."
"Associates – Associates are companies over which Siemens Energy AG 
has the ability to exercise significant influence regarding operating and 
financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of 20% 
to 50% of the voting rights)."
"These are recorded in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recogni-
zed at cost."
"The Company’s share of an associate’s post-acquisition 
profits or losses is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of 
Income, and its share of post-acquisition changes in equity that have 
not been recognized in the associate’s profit or loss is recognized 
directly in equity."
"The cumulative post-acquisition changes are adjusted 
against the carrying amount of the investment in the associate."
"When 
the Siemens Energy ‘s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds 
its interest in the associate, the Company does not recognize further 
losses, unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the 
associate."
"The interest in an associate is the carrying amount of the in-
vestment in the associate together with any long-term interests that, in 
substance, form part of the Company’s net investment in the associate."
"Joint ventures – Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens Energy 
and one or more parties have joint control."
"Joint control requires 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on 
relevant activities."
"Joint Ventures are also recorded in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements using the equity method."
"Differences arising 
from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to 
Net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary 
is recognized."
"The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are trans-
lated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and 
cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of 
the reporting period."
"Foreign currency transaction – Transactions that are denominated in 
a currency other than the functional currency of an entity are recorded 
in that functional currency, applying the spot exchange rate at the date 
when the underlying transactions are initially recognized."
"At the end of 
the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a 
foreign currency are revalued to functional currency, applying the spot 
exchange rate prevailing at that date."
"Gains and losses arising from this 
foreign currency revaluations are recognized in Net income."
"Those 
transactions denominated in a foreign currency which are classified as 
non-monetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate."
"Siemens Energy applies hyperinflation accounting in Argentina and 
Turkey."
"Revenue is the trans-
action price Siemens Energy expects to be entitled to."
"The amount of a 
variable consideration is calculated by using either the expected value 
or the most likely amount, depending on which is expected to better 
predict the amount of variable consideration."
"Consideration is adjusted 
for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods 
or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and 
there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or 
Siemens Energy."
"Non-cash consideration in the form of goods, services, 
financial instruments or property, plant and equipment is measured at 
fair value."
"If the fair value of the non-cash consideration cannot be 
estimated reasonably, the consideration is measured indirectly by 
reference to the stand-alone selling price of the goods or services 
promised to the customer in exchange for the consideration."
"An 
estimation of variable consideration is generally constrained and is only 
included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant 
reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are 
resolved."
"If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, 
the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based 
on relative stand-alone selling prices."
"If stand-alone selling prices are 
not directly observable, Siemens Energy reasonably estimates them."
"Discounts and variable considerations are allocated proportionately to 
all performance obligations within a contract unless allocation to one 
or more, but not all, performance obligations is a more accurate 
representation."
"Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation 
either at a point in time or over time."
"Sales from construction-type contracts – Revenues from long-term 
construction contracts are recognized over time based on measuring 
progress."
"Siemens Energy determines the progress using an input 
method that considers the percentage of costs incurred to date 
compared to total estimated costs."
"An expected loss on the contract is 
recognized as an expense immediately."
"Payment terms are usually 30 
days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms."
"When measuring progress using an input method, estimating the 
progress of the transfer of control to the customer is particularly impor-
tant and may include estimates of the amount of work and services 
required to fulfill the contractual obligations."
"These significant 
estimates include total estimated revenues, total estimated costs, 
contract risks, including technical, political, and regulatory risks, as well 
as other judgments."
"These deviations may result in a significant 
increase in project costs, a negative impact on project results, a material 
adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of opera-
tions, and, in some cases, litigation."
"As a result, changes in estimates 
may increase or decrease revenue."
"In addition, it is necessary to assess 
whether the continuation or termination of a contract is the most likely 
scenario."
"For this assessment, all relevant facts and circumstances are 
considered individually for each contract."
"Separate special purpose entities are set-up for the development and 
sale of wind farms."
"The non-current assets of the wind farms, the shares 
of which are fully consolidated, are presented as inventories."
"Revenue from services – Revenues are recognized over time on a 
straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-
line, as services are provided (i.e., measuring progress as described 
above)."
"Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice 
issued according to the contractual terms."
"Sale of goods – Revenues are recognized at a point in time when 
control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the 
goods."
"Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable 
within 30 days."
"For licensing transactions granting the customer a right 
to use Siemens Energy’s intellectual property, payment terms are 
usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the 
contractual terms."
"Income from interest – Interest is recognized using the effective 
interest method."
"Functional costs – In general, operating expenses by types are 
assigned to the functions in accordance with the functional area of the 
corresponding profit and cost centers."
"Amortization, depreciation and 
impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are 
included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets."
"Government grants – Government grants are recognized when there 
is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to the grants are 
complied with and the grants will be received."
"Grants awarded for the 
purchase or the production of fixed assets (grants related to assets) are 
generally recognized as a reduction of the acquisition or construction 
costs of the respective assets and reduce future depreciations 
accordingly."
"Grants awarded for other than non-current assets (grants 
related to income) are reported in the Consolidated Statements of 
Income under the same functional area as the corresponding expenses."
"They are recognized as income over the periods necessary to match 
them on a systematic basis to the costs that are intended to be 
compensated."
"Government grants for future expenses are recorded as 
deferred income."
"Product-related expenses – Provisions for estimated costs related to 
product warranties and onerous contracts are recorded in the line item 
Cost of sales."
"Research and development costs – Costs of research activities are 
expensed as incurred."
"Costs of development activities are capitalized 
when the recognition criteria in accordance with IAS 38, Intangible 
Assets, are met."
"Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization 
period of generally three to ten years."
"Earnings per share – Basic earnings per share are computed by 
dividing 
Net 
income 
attributable 
to 
the 
shareholders 
of 
Siemens Energy AG by the weighted average number of outstanding 
shares of Siemens Energy AG."
"Diluted earnings per share are calculated 
by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities 
and share-based payment plans."
"Goodwill – Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes 
in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable."
"Goodwill is carried at cost less accumu-
lated impairment losses."
"The goodwill impairment test is performed at 
the level of a cash-generating unit, generally represented by an opera-
Consolidated Financial Statements 96 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
ting segment."
"This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for 
internal management purposes."
"For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to the cash-generating unit that is expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the business combination."
"If the carrying 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated 
exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill 
allocated to this cash-generating unit is recognized."
"The recoverable 
amount is the higher of the cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs 
of disposal and its value in use."
"If either of these values exceeds the 
carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values."
"These values are generally determined on the basis of discounted cash 
flow calculations."
"Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in 
future periods."
"The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit 
to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by 
management."
"The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced, 
for example, by the successful integration of acquired entities, the 
volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign 
exchange rate fluctuations or the anticipated economic trends."
"In determining recoverable 
amounts, discounted cash flow calculations use generally five-year 
projections that are based on financial forecasts."
"Cash flow projections 
take into account past experience and represent management’s best 
estimate about future developments."
"Cash flows after the planning 
period are extrapolated using individual growth rates and an expected 
long-term inflation rate."
"Key assumptions on which management has 
based its determination of fair value less costs of disposal and value in 
use include estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of 
capital."
"These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a 
material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of 
any goodwill impairment."
"Other intangible assets – Siemens Energy amortizes intangible assets 
with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their respective 
estimated useful lives."
"Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses, and 
other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for 
intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired in business combi-
nations."
"Intangible assets acquired in business combinations primarily 
consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and technology."
"Useful 
lives in specific acquisitions range from six to 20 years for customer 
relationships and from five to 20 years for technology."
"Property, plant and equipment – Property, plant and equipment, 
including right-of-use assets, is valued at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses."
"Depreciation expense is re-
cognized using the straight-line method."
"Extension options are included in the lease term, and thus in the 
measurement of the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, 
if their exercise is reasonably certain."
"Remeasurements reflect changes 
in the assessment of options."
"Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible 
assets – Siemens Energy reviews property, plant and equipment and 
other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable."
"In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are 
subject to an annual impairment test."
"Impairment testing of property, 
plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of 
estimates in determining the assets’ recoverable amount, which can 
have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately on the 
amount of any impairment."
"Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell."
"The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the 
use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain."
"Income taxes – Tax positions under respective local tax laws, relevant 
court decisions, and tax authorities’ views can be complex and subject 
to different interpretations by taxpayers and local tax authorities."
"Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax 
reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax 
payments for prior years and are taken into account based on 
management’s considerations."
"Under the liability method, deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences 
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying 
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases."
The so-called initial recognition exemption is also considered.
"As a 
significant application of the initial recognition exemption, no deferred 
taxes were recognized for deductible temporary differences arising in 
connection with issuing the mandatory convertible note."
"Deferred tax 
assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, 
including income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of 
existing taxable temporary differences, and established tax planning 
opportunities."
"As of each period-end, Siemens Energy evaluates the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets, generally based on five-year 
projections of future taxable profits."
"As future developments are 
uncertain and partly beyond Siemens Energy’s control, assumptions are 
necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in 
which deferred tax assets will be recovered."
"Estimates are revised in the 
period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption."
"In 
some countries in which Siemens Energy operates, statutory tax law on 
global minimum taxation has been adopted in accordance with the 
OECD guidelines on global minimum taxation (BEPS Pillar 2)."
"According 
to IAS 12 Income Taxes, Siemens Energy did not recognize any potential 
effects regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities."
"Contract assets, contract liabilities, receivables – When either party 
to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens Energy recog-
nizes a contract asset, a contract liability, or a receivable depending on 
the relationship between Siemens Energy’s performance and the 
customer’s payment."
"Contract assets and liabilities are recognized as 
current since they arise in the normal operating cycle."
"Receivables are 
recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional."

Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for Contract assets and 
receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets 
measured at amortized cost."
"A refund liability, as a component of con-
tract liabilities, is recognized when Siemens Energy receives considera-
tion from a customer and expects to be required to refund some or all 
of that consideration to the customer."
"A refund liability is measured at 
the amount of the consideration received for which Siemens Energy 
does not expect to be entitled."
"Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or 
production costs and net realizable value, costs generally being 
determined on the basis of an average or first-in, first-out method."
"Net 
realizable value corresponds to the estimated selling price net of 
remaining costs of completion and selling."
"Determining net realizable 
value of Inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity, techni-
cal, and price risks."
"Trade and other payables – Siemens Energy invites suppliers to 
participate in Supply Chain Financing Programs in order to benefit from 
accelerated payment compared with Siemens Energy’s regular payment 
terms."
"Such payables represent payables for goods and services that are 
incurred within the Company’s normal operating cycle and are part of 
the Company’s working capital."
"Suppliers must formally agree to partici-
pate in such programs."
"Therefore, the corresponding payables are still 
shown in the line item Trade and other payables."
"Defined benefit plans – Siemens Energy measures the entitlements by 
applying the projected unit credit method."
"This approach reflects an 
actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitle-
ment for services already rendered."
"In determining the net present 
value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered 
(Defined Benefit Obligation, DBO), the expected rates of future salary 
increase and expected rates of future pension progression are 
considered."
"The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of 
the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the 
calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the 
following year."
"The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year 
will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by 
the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding fiscal year’s 
period-end date."
"Service cost, past service cost, and settlement gains (losses) for 
pensions and similar obligations, as well as administration costs 
unrelated to the management of plan assets, are allocated to functional 
costs."
"Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized 
immediately in profit or loss."
"For unfunded plans, the amount of the 
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations line item equals the DBO."
"For funded plans, Siemens Energy offsets the fair value of the plan 
assets with the DBO."
"Siemens Energy recognizes the net amount, after 
adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling."
"Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the 
difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included 
in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)."
"They are 
recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes."
"Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions, including discount rates, 
expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression, and 
mortality rates."
"The discount rates used are determined by reference to 
yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and 
currency at the end of the reporting period."
"In case such yields are not 
available, the discount rates are based on government bonds yields."
"Due to changing market, economic, and social conditions, the under-
lying key assumptions may differ from actual developments."
"Entitlements resulting from plans based on investment returns from 
underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the 
underlying assets at period-end."
"If the performance of the underlying 
assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by 
projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and 
discounting back to a present value."
"If 
the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money."
"When a 
contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is 
recognized as a provision."
"Significant estimates are involved in determining provisions related to 
warranty costs, onerous contracts, legal and regulatory proceedings, as 
well as governmental investigations (legal proceedings)."
"The measurement of warranty provisions reflects whether the under-
lying obligation results from a single obligation or a larger population 
of items."
"In 
particular, the assumptions and estimates regarding failure rates are, as 
previously mentioned, sometimes subject to significant uncertainties 
insofar as they relate to new technologies for which hardly any 
operating data is available."
"Siemens Energy records a provision for onerous contracts with 
customers when the current estimated total costs exceed the estimated 
revenues."
"Uncertainties regarding asset retirement obligations include the 
estimated costs of decommissioning because of the long timeframe 
over which future cash outflows are expected to occur, including the 
respective interest accretion."
"Legal proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to 
substantial uncertainties."
"Internal and external counsels are generally part of the 
determination process."
"Due to new developments, it may be necessary, 
to record a provision for an ongoing legal proceeding or to adjust the 
amount of a previously recognized provision."
"Upon resolution of a legal 
proceeding, Siemens Energy may incur charges in excess of the 
recorded provisions for such matters."
"The outcome of legal proceedings 
may have a material effect on Siemens Energy’s financial position, its 
results of operations and (or) its cash flows."
"The determination of expenses is based on various 
assumptions that also require judgements and estimates and may 
therefore contain uncertainties in this respect."
"These include in 
particular the acceptance rate, the underlying salary, and length of 
service."
"If employees are offered severance packages, the benefits are 
measured on the basis of the expected number of employees who will 
accept the offer."
"Termination benefits – Termination benefits are provided as a result 
of an entity’s offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy 
before the regular retirement date or of an entity’s decision to terminate 
the employment."
"Termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19, 
Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when 
the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits."
"Cash and cash equivalents – Siemens Energy considers all highly 
liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the 
date of acquisition to be cash equivalents."
"Cash and cash equivalents 
are measured at amortized cost."
"Financial instruments – A financial instrument is any contract that 
gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity."
"Regular way 
purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade 
date."
"Siemens Energy does not use the option to designate financial 
assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss at 
inception (fair value option)."
"Initially, financial instruments are 
recognized at fair value and net of transaction costs, if they are not 
categorized at fair value through profit or loss."
"Subsequently, financial 
assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which 
they are assigned."
"Equity instruments are measured at 
FVTPL unless the option to recognize fair value changes in other 
comprehensive income has been exercised."
"Valuation allowances are recognized for expected credit losses, 
representing a forward-looking estimate of future credit losses 
involving significant judgment."
"Expected credit loss is the gross carrying 
amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a 
factor reflecting the loss in the event of default."
"Valuation allowances 
are not recognized when the gross carrying amount is sufficiently 
collateralized."
"Probabilities of default are mainly derived from rating 
grades."
"A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade 
receivables and Contract assets by applying their lifetime expected 
credit losses."
"Financial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears 
unlikely."
"Generally, the limitation period has expired if a debtor’s sworn 
statement of affairs has been received, or if the receivable is not 
pursued due to its minor value."
"Receivables are written off when bank-
ruptcy proceedings close."
"A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire 
or when the financial asset is transferred to another party."
"Significant 
modifications of the contractual terms of a financial asset measured at 
amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new 
financial asset; for insignificant modifications, the carrying amount of 
the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition."
"Credit guarantees – Credit guarantees are recognized at the higher of 
consideration received for granting the guarantee and expected credit 
losses determined."
"Financial liabilities – Except for derivative financial instruments, 
Siemens Energy measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method."
"Hybrid instruments are analyzed to determine whether these should be 
accounted for entirely as debt or split into an equity component and a 
debt component."
"For the mandatory convertible note issued in 
September 2022, Siemens Energy’s early conversion right, which 
allows conversion of the nominal amount into a fixed number of shares, 
was identified as an important criterion."
"Siemens Energy considers the 
early conversion right to be economically substantial for capital and 
rating management purposes and hence accounts for the mandatory 
convertible note as a compound financial instrument."
"The debt com-
ponent corresponds to the present value of the coupons and is reported 
under financial liabilities."
"Proportionate directly attributable transaction 
costs allocated to the debt component are amortized to interest 
expense over the term to maturity."
"The remaining amount, after deduc-
tion of proportionate directly attributable transaction costs, is the equi-
ty component, which is reported in capital reserves."
"Lease liabilities – Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of 
the lease payments payable over the lease term, generally discounted 
using the incremental borrowing rate unless the rate implicit in the 
lease can be readily determined."
"Lease liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method."
"They 
are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease."
"Derivative financial instruments – Derivative financial instruments, 
such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap 
contracts, are measured at fair value."
"Changes in the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments are recognized either in Net income or, 
in the case of a cash flow hedge, in the Other comprehensive income 
line item, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax)."
"Certain 
derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted 
for separately as derivatives."
"Cash flow hedges – The effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recogni-
zed in Other comprehensive income line item, net of income taxes, and 
any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in Net income."
"Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into Net income in the 
same periods in which the hedged item affects Net income."
"Share-based payment – At Siemens Energy, share-based payment 
awards are classified as equity-settled."
"The fair value is measured at the 
grant date and expensed over the vesting period."
"The fair value is 
determined as the market price of the underlying shares, considering 
dividends during the vesting period to which the grantees are not 
entitled, as well as market and non-vesting conditions, if applicable."
"These amendments 
had no material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"On May 21, 2022, Siemens Energy announced a voluntary cash tender 
offer for all outstanding shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A., 
i.e., approx."
"32.9% of the entity’s share capital not yet owned by

and the carrying amount of all individually non-material joint ventures 
amounted to €101 million (2022: €108 million)."
"The increase in indivi-
dually non-material associates is primarily due to the acquisition of the 
investment in Shanghai Electric Power Generation Equipment Co."
as described in Note 27 Related party transactions.
"Summarized 
financial information for all individually non-material associates and 
joint ventures, adjusted for the percentage of ownership held by 
Siemens Energy, is presented below."
"Items included in the Statements 
of Comprehensive Income are presented for the twelve-month period 
reported using the equity method."
"In fiscal 
year 2022, other operating income mainly arose from the sales of 
intangible assets as well as property, plant and equipment and other 
outputs."
"In fiscal year 2023, other operating expenses were mainly incurred in 
connection with share-based payments from the Direct Match Program 
as well as with sales of intangible assets and property, plant and equip-
ment."
"The de-
ferred tax in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 include tax effects of the origi-

"In Germany, the calculation of current tax in fiscal year 2023 is based 
on a combined tax rate of 32%, as in the prior year, consisting of a 
corporate tax rate of 15%, a solidarity surcharge thereon of 5.5%, and 
an average trade tax rate of 16%."
"For foreign subsidiaries, current taxes 
are calculated on the basis of local tax law and applicable tax rates in 
the individual foreign countries."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities in 
Germany and abroad are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled."
"The item consists of €1,270 million and €300 million, 
respectively, for non-recognition and of €845 million and €23 million, 
respectively, for change in realizability of deferred tax assets and tax 
credits."
"As a consequence, for companies with a recent loss history in

Other loss carryforwards mainly include interest carryforwards.
"The net deferred tax assets of companies in a current loss situation 
amount to €43 million and €644 million, respectively."
"The decrease 
compared to the previous year is due to the changes in realizability of 
deferred tax assets and tax credits as a result of the changed business 
outlook at Siemens Gamesa and due to companies, which are no longer 
in a current loss situation."
"In fiscal 
year 2022 there was an offsetting effect resulting from a reclassifica-
tion of assets and liabilities held for disposal."

taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the cumulative earnings of sub-
sidiaries of €6,620 million in fiscal year 2023 (2022: €5,946 million)

"NOTE 7 Contract assets, liabilities and 
revenues 
As of September 30, 2023, amounts expected to be settled after twelve 
months were €948 million for Contract assets (2022: €901 million) and 
€3,419 million for Contract liabilities (2022: €3,325 million)."
"In fiscal year 2023, €25 million were included in revenue, relating to 
performance obligations satisfied in previous periods (2022: €7 million)."
"In fiscal year 2023, revenue included €10,122 million which was 
included in Contract liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal year 
(2022: €6,700 million)."
"Compared with the prior year, write-downs increased by €101 million 
(2022: decreased by €143 million)."
"The goodwill of the former GP segment was reallocated to the 
reorganized corporate structure using on relative values."
"The reallo-
cation did not result in any goodwill impairments."
"Prior year disclosures 
are based on the corporate structure before reorganization."
"Siemens Energy performs the mandatory annual impairment test in the 
three months ending September 30."
"In the annual impairment test 
2023, the recoverable amounts for the Group’s cash-generating units 
were estimated to be higher than the carrying amounts."
"For the pur-
pose of estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units, cash 
flows were projected for the next five years based on past experience, 
actual operating results, and management’s best estimate about future 
developments as well as market assumptions."
"In order to reflect an 
appropriate period necessary to reach a steady state, the planning pe-
riod for Wind Turbines and Operation and Maintenance was extended 
from five years last year to seven years."
"The values in use are mainly driven by the terminal value, which is 
particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions about the terminal 
value growth rate and discount rate."
"Both assumptions are determined 
individually for each cash-generating unit."
"Discount rates are based on 
the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)."
"The discount rates are 
calculated on the basis of a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk 
premium."
"In addition, the discount rates reflect the current market 
assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit by taking 
into account specific peer group information on beta factors, leverage, 
and cost of debt."
"The parameters for calculating the discount rates are 
based on external sources of information."
"The peer group is subject to 
an annual review and adjusted, if necessary."
"Terminal value growth 
rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data 
and industry specific trends."
"The aggregate carrying amount of this goodwill amounted to 
€1,667 million as of September 30, 2023."
"The average revenue growth rate in the planning period for these goodwill-carrying units was 9.8% as a 
whole."

Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
In fiscal year 2022, for Wind Turbines and Operation and Maintenance the fair value less cost of disposal, and for Gas and Power the value in use 
were calculated."
"In addition to the key assumptions presented in the table below, a long-term Adjusted EBITA margin approaching 8% was applied 
for Gas and Power, and long-term Adjusted EBITA margins at around 20% and around 8% were applied for Operation and Maintenance and Wind 
Turbines, respectively."
"During the five-year planning period expected 
profit margin ranges which, on average, are based on the respective 
target profit ranges for fiscal year 2026 as detailed in the table below 
were applied."
"Considering geopolitical develop-
ments, also with regard to gas supply, the Group is dealing with 
challenging structural global energy market trends, in particular for 
large gas turbines as a result of continuing decarbonization."
"For the goodwill-carrying units Operation and Maintenance as well as 
Wind Turbines, Siemens Energy anticipates, based on the current 
challenging market environment in the wind industry, marked margin 
improvements in the coming years."
"Profit margins of around 5% and 
around 19% were applied for Wind Turbines and Operation and Main-
tenance, respectively."
"In this case, the planning was based on improve-
ments in the ramp-up of production in the offshore business and 
existing quality issues of certain onshore platforms as well as ongoing 
progress in product costs within the planning period."
"In addition, 
however, the Group is also dealing with challenging structural global 
energy market trends."
"As part of the planning process various external studies 
such as those from S&P Global and the International Energy Agency 
regarding scenarios for the development of the global energy system 
were considered."
"The sensitivity analysis for the cash-generating units was based on a 
reduction of 10% in future cash flows, or an increase of one percentage 
point in discount rates, or a reduction of one percentage point in the 
terminal value growth rate."
"Siemens Energy concluded that no impair-
ment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill in any of the cash-
generating units."
"and Siemens Gamesa 
business acquisitions."
"The customer relationships that relate to the 
Dresser-Rand acquisition will be amortized over a period of 20 years."
"Through the Dresser-Rand acquisition, Siemens Energy has a compre-
hensive portfolio of equipment and capability for the oil and gas 
industry and a much-expanded installed base, allowing Siemens Energy 
to address the needs of the market with products, solutions, and ser-
vices."
"Technology related to the Dresser-Rand acquisition will be amor-
tized primarily over a period of 20 years."
"Intangible assets associated with the Siemens Gamesa acquisition 
mainly relate to technology und customer relationships and are being 
amortized primarily over a period of eight to 20 years."
"As of September 30, 2023, the gross carrying amount of advances to 
suppliers and construction in progress included mainly machinery and 
equipment under construction."
"As of September 30, 2023, contractual 
commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment were 
€375 million (2022: €330 million)."
"In fiscal year 2023, government grants awarded for the purchase or the 
production of property, plant and equipment amounted to €4 million 
(2022: €2 million)."
"The award of further government grants of 
€69 million in fiscal 2023 (2022: €39 million), related to costs incurred 
and future costs."
"In fiscal year 2023, expenses recognized for short-term and low-value 
leases not accounted for under the right-of-use model were 
€343 million (2022: €240 million)."
"In fiscal year 2023, the second of two one-
year extension options was exercised."
"The credit facility will now matu-
re in 2026."
"As of September 30, 2023, Siemens Gamesa had a multi-currency revol-
ving credit facility amounting to €2,000 million (2022: €2,500 million)."
"As of September 30, 2022, the credit facility included a fully drawn 
term loan tranche of €500 million, which was fully repaid in 
fiscal year 2023."
The credit facility has a term until December 2026.
"There are contractual interactions with Siemens Energy‘s €3,000 mil-
lion syndicated revolving credit facility, as this provides for a restriction 
on credit borrowing by group subsidiaries."
"Due to the approval by 
Siemens Energy’s syndicate banks, the possibility for Siemens Gamesa 
to borrow credits after the delisting remained possible."
"If this approval 
is not extended, a maximum of €3,300 million could be drawn on the 
two credit facilities in total from July 2024."
"As of September 30, 2023, 
Siemens Gamesa has not drawn any amounts under the credit line 
(2022: €200 million)."
"The credit facility may be used for general cor-
porate purposes and to refinance outstanding debt."
"Additionally, to finance the acquisiton of all outstanding shares in 
Siemens Gamesa, Siemens Energy signed a syndicated bridge credit 
facility amounting to €4,200 million in May 2022, which was reduced 
to an amount of €620 million by the end of fiscal year 2023."
"As of 
September 30, 2023, the credit line had been drawn in full 
(2022: €0 million)."
"In October 2023, the first of two six-month ex-
tension options was exercised."
"The credit line will now mature in May 
2024."
"In fiscal year 2023, the weighted average interest rate for loans from 
banks was 4.41% (2022: 2.40%)."
"Notes and bonds 
On September 14, 2022, Siemens Energy issued a subordinated man-
datory convertible note in the aggregate nominal amount of 
€960 million, which will be converted into no par value shares of the 
Company at maturity."
"The net proceeds were used to partially fund the 
purchase of all outstanding shares in Siemens Gamesa."
"The mandatory 
convertible note was accounted for as compound financial instrument."
"Only the present value of the coupons of 5.625% was recognized as 
financial liability."
"As of September 30, 2023, the financial liability 
amounted to €103 million (2022: €152 million)."
"On April 5, 2023, Siemens Energy issued a so-called Green Bond in the 
aggregate nominal amount of €1,500 million."
"The Green Bond compri-
ses notes in the amount of €750 million with a term of three years, ma-
turing on April 5, 2026, and an annual coupon of 4.00% and notes in 
the amount of €750 million with a term of six years, maturing on 
April 5, 2029, and an annual coupon of 4.25%."
"The proceeds were used 
to refinance Siemens Gamesa‘s existing debt."
"This qualifies as eligible

green expenditure according to Siemens Energy’s Green Bond Frame-
work."
"Siemens Energy has a program for the issuance of debt instruments 
(commercial paper program) in place under which, as of Septem-
ber 30, 2023, and September 30, 2022, up to €3,000 million can be 
issued."
"As of September 30, 2023, €432 million were outstanding 
(2022: €0 million)."
"Lease liabilities 
In fiscal year 2023, the expenses relating to variable lease payments not 
included in the measurement of lease liabilities amounted to 
€38 million (2022: €83 million)."
"Since both the use and volume of the 
leases are constant, no significant increase in variable future lease 
payments is expected."
"NOTE 13 Post-employment benefits/ 
Provisions for pensions and similar 
obligations 
Siemens Energy provides post-employment defined benefit plans and 
defined contribution plans to almost all employees in Germany and the 
majority of employees outside Germany."
"Defined benefit plans 
Defined benefit plans which are open to new entrants are based 
predominantly on contributions made by Siemens Energy."
"Only to a 
certain extent are those plans affected by longevity, inflation, and 
compensation increases and consider country-specific differences."
"Siemens Energy’s major plans are mostly funded with assets in 
segregated entities."
"In accordance with local laws and bilateral agree-
ments with benefit trusts (trust agreement), those plans are managed 
in the interest of the beneficiaries."
"In fiscal year 2023, the defined 
benefit plans covered an average number of 62.000 participants, 
including 46.000 actives, 6.000 deferreds with vested benefits, and 
10.000 retirees and surviving dependents in around 50 countries."
"The majority of Siemens Energy pension liabilities relate to Germany, 
the United States of America and the United Kingdom."
"The pension 
landscapes in these three countries are described in detail below."
"Germany 
In Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: 
BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), closed legacy 
plans, and deferred compensation plans."
"The majority of active employ-
ees participate in the BSAV."
"The benefits are predominantly based on 
notional contributions and their respective asset returns, subject to a 
minimum return guaranteed by the employer."
"At inception of the BSAV, 
benefits provided under the legacy plans were modified to substantially 
eliminate the effects of compensation increases."
"However, the legacy 
plans still expose Siemens Energy to investment risk, interest rate risk, 
and longevity risk."
"The pension plans are funded via contractual trust 
arrangements (CTA)."
"In Germany, no legal or regulatory minimum 
funding requirements apply."
"United States of America 
The majority of the defined benefit plans in the U.S."
"have been closed 
to new entrants and frozen to future benefit accruals."
"Siemens Energy 
has appointed the Benefits Committee as the named fiduciary for the 
management of the assets of the plan."
"The plan’s assets are held in the 
Trust and the Trustee of the Trust is responsible for the administration 
of the assets of the Trust, taking directions from the Benefits 
Committee."
"The plans are subject to the funding requirements under 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 as 
amended."
"There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum 
funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid 
benefit restrictions."
"At their discretion, sponsoring employers may 
contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement."
"Annual required 
contributions are calculated by independent actuaries."
"United Kingdom 
Pension benefits are mainly offered through the VA Tech U.K."
"The scheme provides benefits on retirement and death of its 
members and is closed for new entrants and frozen to future accruals."
"The required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out 
every third year based on legal requirements."
"From April 2013, the 
Trustee arranged investments in insurance policies covering pension 
payments due to members, which significantly reduced the longevity 
and investment risks for the scheme and provided additional security 
for members."

The changes during fiscal year 2023 and 2022 relate to remeasurement effects.
"2 
 Includes past service benefits/costs, settlement gains/losses and administration costs related to liabilities."
Net interest expenses related to provisions for pensions and similar obligations in fiscal year 2023 amounted to €26 million (2022: €19 million).
"In 
fiscal year 2023, the DBO attributable to active employees stood at 56% (2022: 58%), the DBO attributable to former employees with vested rights 
stood at 9% (2022: 8%), and the DBO attributable to retirees and surviving dependents stood at 35% (2022: 34%)."
"The yield curve approach builds on a spot rate 
yield curve which is derived from the yield of high-quality corporate 
bonds in the respective currency zone."
"The discount rates are obtained 
by combining the spot rate yield curve with the applicable duration of 
the liability."
"In currency zones with no deep market for high-quality 
corporate bonds the discount rate is directly determined based on yields 
for government bonds."

"During the periods presented, sensitivity determinations apply the 
same methodology as applied for the determination of the post-em-
ployment benefit obligation."
"Sensitivities reflect changes in the DBO 
solely for the assumption changed."
"Asset liability matching strategies 
A decline in the plans’ funded status due to adverse developments of 
plan assets and/ or defined benefit obligation resulting from changing 
parameters is considered a significant risk."
"For this reason, the 
investment strategy for the plan assets is derived from the structure and 
characteristics of the defined benefit obligation and is based for most 
plans on asset liability management studies."
"As part of a liability-driven 
investment (LDI) concept, interest rate hedge ratios are defined for 
most plans to reduce the volatility of the funding level."
"The investment 
strategy, the hedging requirements, and the development of the 
funding level are regularly reviewed with the involvement of external 
experts in order to assess the overall picture of the interaction between 
plan assets and defined benefit obligation."
"Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and 
qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evalua-
tion."
"Derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of the risk manage-
ment."
"The 
fair value of fixed income securities is based on prices provided by price 
service agencies."
"The majority of the fixed income securities are traded 
in active markets and are rated investment grade."
"Multi strategy funds 
invest in various asset classes depending on market environment."
"They 
aim to generate a certain absolute return at a given risk."
"Future cash flows 
Employer contributions expected to be paid to defined benefit plans in 
fiscal year 2024 amount to €50 million."
"Over the next ten fiscal years, 
average annual benefit payments of €196 million were expected as of 
September 30, 2023 (2022: €195 million)."
"The weighted average 
duration of the DBO for Siemens Energy defined benefit plans was 11 
years as of September 30, 2023 (2022: 12 years)."
"Defined contribution plans and state plans 
The amount recognized as expense for defined contribution plans 
amounted to €250 million in fiscal year 2023 (2022: €239 million)."
"Contributions to state plans amounted to €495 million in fiscal 
year 2023 (2022: €477 million)."
"For the majority of 
non-current provisions, cash outflows during the next five years are 
expected."
"The majority of provisions for warranties as well as for 
onerous contracts and risks in connection with quality problems at 
Siemens Gamesa wind turbines are expected to impact cash in the next 
ten fiscal years, with approximately one third expected for the next two 
fiscal years."
"Warranties relate to completed projects and products sold and are cal-
culated on the basis of expected repair and replacement costs through 
projected failure rates determined using a statistical model."
"This 
anticipates product defects or functional failures that may arise during 
the warranty period and require repair."
"In addition, the recognition of 
non-recurring provisions is derived from various factors, such as cus-
tomer complaints and quality issues, where the expected failure rates 
are above normal."
"Thus, provisions for warranties also include provisions for the repair of 
specific components due to exceptional technical problems."
"They are 
recognized as soon as the technical problem has been identified and 
the specific scope can be assessed."
"This includes issues such as serial 
defects, major repair cases of specific components and potentially 
derived customer claims."
"The increase in provisions for warranties is mainly due to the very sharp 
rise in the expected failure rates for main bearings and rotor blades of 
various wind turbine models and the associated cost increases at 
Siemens Gamesa."
"The 4.X and 5.X onshoreturbines were primarily 
affected."
"In fiscal year 2023, the first 
5.X platform was handed over to the customer and corresponding 
warranty provisions were recognized."
"As a result of the quality issues 
Consolidated Financial Statements 114 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
that occurred, the failure of components was monitored continuously 
in the subsequent course of the fiscal year."
"The observed failures were 
higher than expected for certain components."
"This could indicate that 
a reassessment of the failure rate may be necessary in the future."
"The 
root cause analysis of the quality issues identified in fiscal year 2023 is 
still ongoing and is expected to be completed during the first half of 
fiscal year 2024."
"This may lead to adjustments of the expected failure 
rates and might have material negative effects on net assets, financial 
position and results of operations."
"In view of the results obtained to 
date on failures and considering the short additional statistical 
observation period, the models updated in the third quarter of fiscal 
year 2023 continue to represent the most reliable basis for the best 
estimate of failure rates."
"As of September 30, 2023, provisions for warranties amounted to 
€2,992 million 
(2022: €2,425 million), 
of 
which 
€1,961 million 
(2022: €1,408 million) related to the Segment Siemens Gamesa."
"Contract-related provisions for onerous contracts and risks are 
recognized for expected losses and risks from uncompleted construc-
tion contracts and sales."
"The higher failure rates for the above-mentioned wind turbine 
components led to significantly higher planned costs than previously 
assumed and, in some cases, to provisions for onerous contracts."
"In 
addition, increased product costs in connection with the challenges in 
the ramp-up of offshore activities led to the recognition of provisions 
for onerous contracts, particularly for projects for which binding offers 
were submitted."
"As of September 30, 2023, provisions for onerous 
contracts amounted to €1,847 million (2022: €1,067 million), of which 
€1,628 million 
(2022: €626 million) 
related 
to 
the 
Segment 
Siemens Gamesa."
"Other includes provisions for legal proceedings, as far as the risks that 
are subject to such legal proceedings are not already covered by project 
accounting."
"Provisions for legal proceedings as of September 30, 2023, 
amounted to €289 million (2022: €93 million)."
"The increase is mainly 
due to a reclassification of risks previously recognized in project 
accounting with no effect on income."
"NOTE 15 Equity 
Issued capital and capital increase 
As of September 30, 2023, the issued capital of Siemens Energy was 
divided into 799,309,712 registered shares with no-par value and a 
notional value of €1.00 per share (2022: 726,645,193 registered shares 
with no-par value)."
The shares are fully paid in.
"At the Shareholders’ 
Meeting, each share has one vote and accounts for the shareholders’ 
proportionate share in the Company’s Net income."
"In principle, all 
shares confer the same rights and obligations."
"Shares held by 
Siemens AG (directly and indirectly) are subject to the restrictions 
arising from the existing deconsolidation agreement (“Entherrschungs-
vertrag”)."
"The new, registered shares with no-par 
value were placed by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process at a 
price of €17.32 per share."
"The difference between the issue price and 
the notional value of €1.00 per share was allocated to capital reserve 
after deduction of transaction cost of €15 million."
"This increased the 
capital reserve by €1,171 million."
"Following the capital increase on March 15, 2023, Siemens Energy AG’s 
authorized capital of up to €291 million was divided into up to 
290,658,077 shares as of September 30, 2023 (2022: €363 million di-
vided into up to 363,322,596 shares)."
"Based on the authorization 
approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting, the shares can be issued accor-
ding to the details set out in the authorization."
"The Conditional Capital 2023 serves 
the purpose of issuing shares to holders/ creditors of convertible bonds 
or warrants under warrant bonds issued on the basis of the renewed 
authorization in accordance with the resolution of the Shareholders’ 
Meeting."
"On December 23, 2022, Siemens Energy announced a share buyback 
with a volume up to €130 million but not more than 72,664,519 
shares, ending September 30, 2023, at the latest."
"The share buyback 
started on January 2, 2023, and was completed on May 18, 2023."
"The main performance 
measure used to assess the capital structure of Siemens Energy is the 
Adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio."

"Starting fiscal year 2023, receivables and payables from Siemens AG 
from financing activities (2022: net receivables €92 million) are no 
longer part of the net debt/ (net cash)."
"Prior year information is presen-
ted on a comparable basis."
"Credit guarantees 
generally provide that, in the event of default or non-payment by the 
primary debtor, Siemens Energy will be required to settle such financial 
obligations."
"The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the 
maximum amount of the underlying lines of credit that can be drawn."
"The credit guarantees shown in the table are mostly guarantees for the 
external financial liabilities of an associated company."
"The remaining 
term of these credit guarantees is up to five years."
"Siemens Energy also issues guarantees for third-party performance, 
which mainly include guarantees of advance payments and 
performance bonds in consortium arrangements."
"In the event of a claim 
under the guarantees, Siemens Energy will be required to pay up to an 
agreed maximum amount."
"These agreements typically have terms of 
up to ten years."
"Besides the guarantees issued by Siemens Energy 
during the periods presented, Siemens Group has provided additional 
guarantees for the Siemens Energy business for which Siemens Group 
has a right of recourse against Siemens Energy in case the guarantees 
are invoked."
"In addition, Siemens Energy issued other guarantees, including indem-
nifications in connection with the disposal of businesses."
"The table 
above shows the maximum future payments from these obligations to 
the extent that future claims are not considered unlikely."
"Moreover, Siemens Energy acts as a partner in commercial partner-
ships, has capital contribution obligations and is jointly and severally 
liable for the partnerships’ liabilities."
"Besides that, some subsidiaries abroad have significant potential tax 
risks that were not recognized in the statement of financial position due 
to insufficient probability of occurrence."
"The potential tax risks result 
from a large number of individual cases involving indirect and direct 
taxes."
"Taken individually, the risks are not significant."
"In total, they 
amount to a mid three-digit million euro range."
"NOTE 18 Legal proceedings 
The following legal proceedings relate to the Siemens Energy business 
even if Siemens AG is, for procedural reasons, in some cases still 
mentioned as party to the proceedings."
"Allegedly, these 
four gas turbines had been sold by OAO VO TechnoPromExport to OOO 
VO TechnoPromExport, and had then been locally modified and moved 
to Crimea, a location subject to sanctions."
"In July 2018, the Hamburg 
public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against former and 
current Siemens AG and Siemens Energy employees in respect of 
alleged violations of the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act."
"Siemens AG has been cooperating with the authorities and both 
Siemens AG and Siemens Energy intend to do so going forward."
"Siemens Gamesa has investigated some allegations and indications of 
potential violations of internal policies and procedures, as well as of 
statutory laws, that had emerged from the investigations closed during 
the last fiscal year."
"These investigations did concern the Indian 
subsidiary."
"The respective internal investigations have been completed 
during this fiscal year and revealed no violations with material impact 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2023."
"Siemens Energy is involved in numerous legal proceedings in various 
jurisdictions and is conducting internal investigations with regards to 
allegations of compliance violations which could lead to such legal 
proceedings."
"These legal proceedings could result, in particular, in 
Siemens Energy being subject to the payment of damages and punitive 
damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines, or disgorgement of 
profit."
"In individual cases, this may also lead to, among other things, 
formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of 
business licenses or permits."
"In addition, further legal proceedings may 
be commenced or the scope of pending legal proceedings may be 
extended."
Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates.
"Some of these legal proceedings could result in adverse decisions for 
Siemens Energy, which may have material effects on its business 
activities as well as its financial position, results of operations, and cash 
flows."
"For legal proceedings, information required under IAS 37, Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, is not disclosed if the 
Company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously 
prejudice the position of the entity in a dispute with other parties."

Siemens Energy measures the fair values of derivative financial 
instruments in accordance with the specific type of instrument."
"The fair 
values of derivative interest rate contracts are estimated by discounting 
the expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and 
yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument."
"The fair values 
of foreign currency derivatives are based on current forward exchange 
rates and yield curves."
"Compensating effects from underlying transac-
tions (e.g., firm commitments and forecast transactions) are not taken 
into consideration."
"The fair values of equity instruments measured at 
fair value are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current 
market interest rates."
"The fair values of debt instruments are estimated 
by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates."
"Net gains/ (losses) on financial assets and financial liabilities measured 
at fair value through profit or loss mainly consist of changes in the fair 
value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is 
not applied."
"Offsetting 
Siemens Energy enters into master netting agreements and similar agreements for derivative financial instruments providing protection from the 
risk of a counterparty’s insolvency."
"Particularly, Siemens Energy entered 
into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability 
of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well 
as firm commitments."
"Hedge ineffectiveness can occur when the characteristics between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item do not exactly match."
"In prin-
ciple, sources of ineffectiveness are the effect of credit risk on the fair 
value and timing differences between hedging instrument and hedged 
item."
"In the reporting period, no material ineffective portions were re-
cognized in Net income."
"The hedged foreign currency risks at the reporting date were mainly 
related to foreign currency fluctuations between EUR/DKK, EUR/USD 
and EUR/GBP resulting from long-term contracts entered into by 
Siemens Energy’s operating units."
"The nominal amounts of hed-
ging instruments with remaining maturities of more than twelve 
months were €6,570 million (2022: €5,525 million)."
"Consolidated Financial Statements 122 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
The hedging costs correspond to the forward element of forward con-
tracts for hedging internal loans not designated in a hedging relation-
ship."
"The hedging costs are recognized as interest expense on a 
straight-line basis as the hedged item is time-period related."
"NOTE 21 Financial risk management 
Market price fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash 
flow volatility risk for Siemens Energy."
"The Siemens Energy business, as 
well as its investment and financing activities, are affected particularly 
by changes 
in 
foreign 
exchange rates 
and 
interest rates."
"Siemens Energy seeks to manage and control these risks by way of 
binding internal regulations, primarily through its regular operating and 
financing activities, and uses derivative financial instruments if deemed 
appropriate."
"In order to quantify market risks, Siemens Energy calculates forward-
looking sensitivities on the basis of the economically open risk posi-
tions, which are also used for internal risk management."
"Actual results 
that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or 
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may differ substan-
tially from sensitivities due to fundamental conceptual differences."
"Any market-sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-
bearing investments, related to Siemens Energy pension plans are not 
included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures."
"Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
Transaction risk 
Each Siemens Energy unit that conducts business with international 
counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency 
other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates."
"In the ordinary course of business, Siemens Energy entities are exposed 
to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between 
the Danish krone and the euro, between the U.S."
"dollar and the euro as 
well as between the British pound and the euro."
"Foreign currency 
exchange rate exposure is partly offset by purchasing goods, 
commodities, and services in the respective currencies, as well as 
production activities and other contributions along the value chain in 
the local markets."
"The operating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in 
foreign currencies on a speculative basis."
"Financing 
within 
Siemens Energy Group or investments of the operating units are prefer-
ably carried out in their respective functional currency or on a hedged 
basis."
"According to the Siemens Energy Group policy, Siemens Energy units 
are responsible for recording, measuring, and monitoring their foreign 
currency transaction exposure."
"The net foreign currency position of 
Siemens Energy units serves as a central performance measure and 
must be hedged within a band of at least 75% but no more than 100%."
"The Siemens Energy units conclude their hedging activities either with 
Siemens Energy Inhouse Treasury or directly with external financial ins-
titutions."
"Siemens Energy Inhouse Treasury hedges its foreign currency 
exchange rate risks with external counterparties within the internal 
counterparty limits."
"The exposure to foreign currency transaction risk for each currency is 
measured on the basis of the net foreign currency position for each for-
eign currency, taking into account forecast transactions and monetary 
balance sheet items in foreign currency as well as hedging derivatives."
"Because 
the financial reporting currency of Siemens Energy is the euro, the 
financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euros for 
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"To consider 
the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the 
general assumption is that investments in foreign-based entities are 
permanent and that reinvestment is continuous."
"Effects from foreign 
currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset 
amounts into euros are reflected in the Company’s consolidated equity 
position."
"123

Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a 
financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market in-
terest rates."
"This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets 
and liabilities are different."
"Siemens Energy continuously analyzes the split of external financing at 
variable and fixed rates to optimize its interest rate risk exposure."
"Siemens Energy can use derivative financial instruments to perform a 
comprehensive interest rate risk management when appropriate."
"The exposure to interest rate risk is measured on the basis of the open 
interest rate position for interest rates in the major currencies."
"Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that Siemens Energy is not able to meet its 
financial liabilities."
"Siemens Energy mitigates liquidity risk through the 
implementation of effective working capital and cash management as 
well as the arrangement of credit facilities with financial institutions 
and the establishment of a commercial paper program."
"Liquidity risk 
from gross-settled derivatives is mitigated by way of netting agree-
ments and the active diversification of derivatives across several partner 
banks."
"The review was scenario-based and covered a 
period up to September 30, 2025."
"The analysis included the liquidity available as of the balance sheet 
date, cash flow forecasts for the period under review based on general 
business planning, cash inflows from portfolio measures, the available 
and undrawn credit lines and the maturity profile of existing financial 
liabilities."
"As Siemens Energy offers its customers long-term and large-
scale construction projects (conventional power plants, transmission 
technology, wind turbines, etc.), the customary guarantee lines avail-
able to Siemens Energy were also taken into account."
"In addition, 
significant risks and uncertainties over the period under review, as set 
out in Siemens Energy’s enterprise risk management, were also taken 
into account."
"At the time of the preparation of the financial statements agreements 
for additional guarantee lines have not yet been signed."
"Significant 
progress has been made in the discussions with banks, the German 
government and Siemens Group so that the Executive Board considers 
the successful conclusion of the process as highly likely and has taken 
this into account in its scenario-based analysis."
"Following this review, the Executive Board is of the opinion that 
Siemens Energy has sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern 
for a period of at least 24 months from the balance sheet date in all 
scenarios considered."
"The following table reflects Siemens Energy’s contractually fixed cash 
outflows for settlement, repayments, and interest."
"The disclosed 
expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial 
liabilities are determined on the basis of each particular settlement date 
of a financial instrument and the earliest date on which Siemens Energy 
could be required to pay."
"Cash outflows for financial liabilities 
(including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on the 
conditions existing at September 30, 2023."
"The cash outflows for trade 
and other payables include amounts from Supply Chain Finance 
Programs."
"The participation of suppliers in the programs does not 
change the originally agreed payment terms so the due dates for 
payment remain unchanged."
"These programs serve to finance suppliers 
and therefore do not give rise to significant liquidity risks or con-
centration risks for Siemens Energy."
"Credit risk 
Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss if the contractual partner 
fails to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of 
collateral declines."
"Credit risk is already limited during the customer acceptance process in 
which the customer creditworthiness is assessed before entering into a 
business relationship."
"Each entity is responsible for ensuring robust 
credit risk management practices in its own operating activities."
"Consolidated Financial Statements 124 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk during the 
lifetime of customer relationships is ensured through credit valuations 
using external ratings."
"As a rule, external ratings are obtained from 
Siemens Bank which maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which 
numerous Siemens Energy operating units regularly transfer business 
partner data as the basis for a rating and credit limit recommendation 
process."
"Siemens Bank ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on 
generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained 
from customers, reliable third-parties, data service providers, and credit 
default experiences."
"A country-specific risk compo-
nent is also considered."
"An exposure is considered defaulted if the obligor is unwilling or unable 
to pay its credit obligations."
"A default rating is triggered by a range of 
internally defined events, including the opening of bankruptcy pro-
ceedings, receivables due past 90 days, or a default rating by an exter-
nal rating agency."
"The carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial assets’ 
credit risk."
"Collateral reduces the valuation allowance to the extent that 
it mitigates credit risk."
"Collateral needs to be specific, identifiable, and 
legally enforceable to be taken into account."
"As of September 30, 2023, collateral of €271 million (2022: €664 million) 
related to financial assets measured at fair value."
"That collateral was 
provided in connection with netting agreements for derivatives 
providing protection from the risk of a counterparty’s insolvency."
"As of 
September 30, 2023, collateral held for financial assets measured at 
amortized cost was €160 million (2022: €178 million), comprising 
mostly letters of credit and credit insurance policies."
"As of 
September 30, 2023, collateral held for Contract assets was €1 million 
(2022: €4 million), comprising mostly letters of credit."
"As of September 30, 2023, the gross carrying amount (before valuation 
allowances) of trade receivables from the sale of goods and services 
amounted to €6,980 million (2022: €6,053 million)."
"Based on rating 
information from Siemens Bank, 43% (2022: 44%) had an investment-
grade rating and 57% (2022: 56%) had a non-investment-grade rating."
"Contract assets with a gross carrying amount of €4,288 million 
(2022: €4,847 million) generally share similar risk characteristics."
"The 
amounts described above do not represent economic credit risks, since 
they take account of neither collateral held nor valuation allowances 
already recognized."
"NOTE 22 Share-based payment 
Share-based payment awards granted are based on Siemens Energy AG 
shares that have been granted based on existing and new 
Siemens Energy share-based payment programs."
"Siemens Energy share-based payment programs 
Share-based payment awards may be settled in treasury shares of 
Siemens Energy AG or in cash, at the discretion of Siemens Energy AG."
"They may be forfeited if the beneficiary’s employment is terminated 
prior to expiration of the vesting period."
"At Siemens Energy Group level, 
these share-based payment plans are predominantly accounted for as 
equity-settled share-based payment transactions."
"Total pretax expense 
for share-based payments from Siemens Energy plans amounted to 
€128 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 (2022: €105 million)."
"Building Siemens Energy Incentive Program 
Under the Building Siemens Energy Incentive (BSEI) Program, a low 
triple-digit number of key employees who made key contributions to 
preparing the Spin-Off were granted a one-time Spin-Off incentive in 
fiscal year 2020."
"The initial value of the incentive consists of a 
percentage of the beneficiary’s base salary at the grant date (BSEI target 
amount)."
"It consists of two elements: a short-term cash component, 
which corresponds to 25% of the BSEI target amount, and a long-term 
equity component that corresponds to 75% of the BSEI target amount 
and is composed of forfeitable stock awards (BSEI stock awards)."
"The cash component, totaling €5 million, was paid out in fiscal 
year 2021."
"The number of BSEI stock awards was determined by dividing 75% of 
the BSEI target amount by the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) 
of the shares during the first 120 trading days after the listing."
"Each BSEI 
stock award entitles the holder to receive one share in the Company or, 
in exceptional cases, an equivalent cash payment following the vesting 
period."
"The BSEI stock awards will be settled after a vesting period of 
three years starting on completion of the Spin-Off."
"The settlement of 
the BSEI stock awards is subject to the performance of the share price 
during the first three years following the listing."
"The number of BSEI 
stock awards settled can range from a minimum of 33% to a maximum 
of 300%."
"The minimum number of stock awards will be settled if the 
VWAP of the shares during the last 60 trading days before the end of 
the vesting period is lower than the VWAP during the first 120 trading 
days after the listing."
"The maximum number of stock awards will be 
settled if the price of the shares has at least doubled; a value cap of 4.75 
times the BSEI target amount applies."
"The fair value was estimated 
based on a Monte Carlo simulation over different scenarios to take into 
account the changes in the VWAP and the cap."
"The volatility used in the 
model is based on peer-group data."
"The fair value on the grant date 
totaled €15 million."
"For the BSEI Program, the service period began in September 2020 and 
ended in September 2023."
"The significant drop in the stock market 
price of Siemens Energy shares as of the end of Q3 2023 resulted in 
only the minimum number of shares provided for in the plans being 
transferred in each case in Q4 2023 and the majority of the share 
awards granted under these plans being expired."
"The All Employee Program is a one-time incentive granted in 
fiscal year 2021."
"At the end of November 2020, participating employees of participating 
companies in Germany received Siemens Energy AG shares with a value 
of 2.6% of their individual target amount as of September 1, 2020, or 
at least €1,000 without any additional payment (the 2020 special 
payment)."
"A total of 2,128,740 shares were issued in fiscal year 2021 
at an average price of €21.52 per share."
"In addition, participating employees in Germany and the rest of the 
world received stock awards with a value of 3% of their individual total 
target cash amount as of September 1, 2020 (the target amount)."
"The 
number of shares to be transferred to each participant after the vesting 
period is subject to the share price performance over a period of three 
years after the listing of 
Siemens Energy."
"The number of 
Siemens Energy AG shares transferred can range, in Germany, from a 
minimum of 0% (rest of the world: 100%) to a maximum of 200% (rest 
of the world: 300%)."
"The minimum occurs if the VWAP of the shares 
during the last 60 trading days prior to September 25, 2023, is lower 
than 150% of the VWAP during the first 120 trading days after the 
listing."
"The maximum number of stock awards will be settled if the 
share price has at least doubled; a value cap of 4.0 times (rest of the 
world: 6.0 times) the target amount applies."
"The fair value used for the All Employee Program for the rest of the 
world is estimated on the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation over 
different scenarios to take into account the changes in the VWAP and 
the cap."
"These stock awards are subject to a lock-in period of about 
three years."
The fair value on the grant date totaled € 138 million.
"For the All Employee Program, the service period began in 
September 2020 and ended in September 2023."
"The significant drop in 
the stock market price of Siemens Energy shares as of the end of 
Q3 2023 resulted in only the minimum number of shares provided for 
in the plans being transferred in each case in Q4 2023 and the majority 
of the share awards granted under these plans being expired."
"The stock awards are subject to a 
vesting period of four years and entitle the beneficiary to receive 
Siemens Energy shares without payment of consideration following the 
vesting period."
A cash settlement is possible in exceptional cases.
The stock awards are tied to performance criteria.
"In this context, 40% 
of the target amount is linked to the relative total shareholder return 
(TSR) of Siemens Energy (TSR target)."
"For 
the 2021 tranche, the TSR is calculated as 70% compared to the Total 
Shareholder Return of the STOXX Global 1800 Industrial Goods and 
Services and 30% compared to the MVIS US-Listed Oil Services."
"A further 
40% of the target amount is linked to the basic earnings per share (EPS 
target)."
"The remaining 20% of the target amount is linked to an internal 
Siemens Energy sustainability target based on environment, social and 
governance targets (ESG targets)."
"The target attainment for each 
performance criterion ranges between 0% and 200%."
"In fiscal year 2023, senior managers and Executive Board members 
were granted stock awards settled in shares with a fair value of 
€27 million (2022: €21 million)."
"The weighted average fair value of 
shares granted in fiscal year 2023 amounted to €12.59 per share 
(2022: €16.18 per share) and was determined as the market price of 
the Siemens Energy share less the present value of expected dividends."
"The fair value of the TSR-based stock awards granted was calculated 
using an option price model on the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation."
"In addition to the expected € interest rates, share volatility based on 
peer-group data is also considered."
"Under the global Direct Match Program, employees may invest a certain 
proportion of their compensation in Siemens Energy shares (invest-
ment shares)."
"The shares are purchased at the market price on a 
predetermined date in the second quarter of the fiscal year."
"Plan 
participants have the right to receive one Siemens Energy share 
(matching share) for every three investment shares."
"Employees are 
entitled to participate if they have worked without interruption for the 
Group throughout the vesting period of around three months."
"Both the 
investment shares and the matching shares are subject to a lock-in 
Consolidated Financial Statements 126 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
period of one year."
"The investment amount is up to 5% of the annual 
gross salary calculated for each country."
"The employees of participating companies in Germany are entitled to 
receive two matching shares per investment share for an investment of 
€100 in Siemens Energy shares and one additional free matching share 
per investment share for a further investment of €160."
"Neither the 
investment shares nor the additional matching shares are subject to a 
vesting period."
"For each additional investment, participants have the 
right to receive one free matching share for every three investment 
shares."
"Under this program, matching shares are granted to a certain monetary 
value of €23 million (2022: €27 million)."
"The fair value is therefore 
determined on the basis of a fixed amount on the grant date."
These stock awards may be granted up to three times in a fiscal year.
"The shares that make up the award are vested gradually which means 
that one quarter of the stock awards become exercisable each year 
(known as graded vesting)."
"The fair value of the stock awards on the 
grant date is determined as the market price of the Siemens Energy 
share on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends."
"Due to the vesting structure, each tranche is accounted for as a separate 
share-based payment component."
"The total fair value of ratable stock 
awards granted in 2023 amounted to €97 million (2022: €34 million)."
"The weighted average fair value of shares granted in fiscal year 2023 
amounted to €17.64 per share (2022: €21.90 per share) and was 
determined as the market price of the Siemens Energy share less the 
present value of expected dividends."
"For each of their 25th, 40th 
and 50th service anniversaries, certain senior managers will receive 
Siemens Energy jubilee shares worth €18,000."
"Depending on the share 
price at the time, these amounts will result in the award of different 
numbers of shares."
"There were 3,973,333 (2022: €3,725,022) 
entitlements to jubilee shares outstanding as of September 30, 2023."
"The Executive Board has changed its assessment of the further progress 
of the Accelerating Impact Program (AIP) restructuring program due to 
improved market conditions and volume growth and decided to end the 
job cuts agreed in the AIP framework for Germany."
"This resulted in a 
decrease in other liabilities of €78 million."
"In September 2022, a mandatory convertible note in the aggregate 
nominal amount of €960 million was issued without granting subscrip-
tion rights to existing shareholders of the Company."
"The weighted 
average number of shares increased from the date of issue by the maxi-
mum number of shares to be delivered to the holders of the mandatory 
convertible note."

NOTE 25 Segment information 
Measurement – segments 
Accounting policies for segment information are generally the same as 
those used for the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"However, for 
internal and segment reporting purposes intercompany lease 
transactions are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are 
accounted off-balance by the lessee."
"Intersegment transactions are 
based on market prices."
"Orders 
Orders are determined principally as the expected revenue of accepted 
purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations exist as 
well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding 
letters of intent."
"To determine orders, Siemens Energy considers 
termination rights and customers’ creditworthiness."
"As of September 30, 2023, the order backlog totaled €112 billion 
(2022: €97 billion), thereof GS €41 billion (2022: €42 billion), GT for 
€23 billion (2022: €15 billion), TI for €7 billion (2022: €6 billion), and 
Siemens Gamesa €42 billion (2022: €35 billion)."
"Revenue 
Revenue includes revenue from contracts with customers."
"The 
segments recognize revenue predominantly over time due to the 
nature of their long-term contracts."
"Profit before Special Items 
Siemens Energy Management is responsible for assessing the perfor-
mance of the segments (chief operating decision maker)."
"To increase comparability year-on-year, we use Profit before Special 
items."
"Special items refer to the following topics: 
• Restructuring and integration costs: Restructuring costs refer to 
personnel measures leading to severance charges, including costs 
for terminating service contracts with Siemens Group (Siemens AG 
and its subsidiaries)."
"Due to the further integration of 
Siemens Gamesa and the objective of a consistent presentation 
within the Group, only personnel-related measures for restructuring 
will be included for Siemens Gamesa from fiscal year 2023, in 
contrast to the past."
"Integration costs that occur at Siemen Gamesa 
are related to the integration of companies as well as in the course 
of the integration of Siemens Gamesa into the Group and the 
corresponding transaction costs."
"• Stand-alone costs relate to the separation from Siemens Group and 
the formation of Siemens Energy as an independent enterprise."
"• Major asset impairments and write-downs (as well as any 
subsequent reversals) related to strategic portfolio decisions."
"For both Profit margin and Special items, prior year information is 
presented on a comparable basis."
"The Profit before Special items for Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2023 
amounts to a negative amount of €2,776 million (2022: negative 
amount of €225 million)."
"Asset measurement principles 
Management has specified assets (net capital employed) as the 
measure for assessing the capital intensity of the segments."
"Its 
definition corresponds to the Profit measure except for amortization 
expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and 
goodwill impairments, which are not part of Profit before Special items."
"However, the related intangible assets are included in the segments’ 
assets."
"Segment assets are based on the Total assets shown in the 
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily excluding tax-
related assets, pension assets, and assets of discontinued operations, 
since the corresponding items are excluded from Profit."
"The remaining 
assets are reduced by non-interest-bearing liabilities other than tax-
related liabilities (e.g., Trade payables) to derive assets."
"Free cash flow pre tax 
Free cash flow of the segments constitutes cash flows from operating 
activities less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment."
"It excludes financing interest, except for cases where 
interest on qualifying assets is capitalized or classified as contract costs; 
it also excludes income taxes as well as certain other payments and 
proceeds."
"Amortization, depreciation and impairments 
Amortization, depreciation and impairments include depreciation and 
impairments of property, plant and equipment as well as amortization 
and impairments of intangible assets, each net of reversals of 
impairment."
"Other central items include Siemens brand fees, corporate 
services (e.g."
"This resulted in adjustments to prior year figures for 
revenues by location of customer in the EMEA region by minus €8 million, the Americas by €1 million and Asia, Australia by €7 million."
"The prior year revenue by location of companies figures were adjusted by minus €6 million in the 
EMEA region and by €6 million in Asia, Australia."
"1 
non-current assets consist of property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and other intangible assets."
"NOTE 27 Related party transactions 
Business transactions with related parties are generally carried out at 
arm's length."
"Siemens Energy is supplied by and delivers to 
Siemens Group goods and services."
"In certain countries, the business of 
the business areas Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Transformation 
of Industry is carried out under agency and distributorship agreements 
that were concluded between Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co."
"KG 
and the respective local Siemens Group companies."
"A preferred fi-
nancing agreement governs the cooperation in the financing of 
Siemens Energy customers and their projects by Siemens Group."
"During the Carve-Out, some contracts could not be or were not yet legally 
transferred from Siemens Group to Siemens Energy."
"These contracts are 
generally subcontracted from Siemens Group to Siemens Energy with 
recourse to Siemens Energy in respect of risks."
"Provisions that 
Siemens Energy has recognized for warranties, litigations, and other 
project-related risks relating to such contracts amounted to €843 million 
as of September 30, 2023 (2022: €904 million)."
"Contractual 
arrangements 
between 
Siemens Group 
and 
Siemens Energy also include mutual compensation obligations for 
potential tax effects triggered by changes in the shareholder structure 
of Siemens Energy."
"Depending on the time of occurrence of the 
changes as well as on the underlying valuations, this could lead to a 
cash outflow."
"As part of the Spin-Off in fiscal year 2020, Siemens Energy and 
Siemens Group also entered into an agreement that obliges 
Siemens Energy to acquire a 40% share in the joint venture Shanghai

as for reviews of interim financial statements integrated into the audit."
"NOTE 30 Subsequent events 
On October 11, 2023, Siemens Energy signed an agreement for the 
sale of the Trench Group (“Trench”) to SCUR-Alpha 1646 GmbH, a sub-
sidiary of the investment firm Triton."
"The business specializes in high-
voltage grid components including bushings, instrument transformers 
and coil products."
"Trench is part of the GT segment and has locations in 
Germany, Austria, France, Bulgaria, Italy, China, and Canada."
"The 
closing of the transaction is expected for the first half of calendar 
year 2024 and is anticipated to result in a cash inflow in the low to mid 
three-digit million euro range."
"Siemens Energy intends to sell part of its 24% interest in Siemens Ltd., 
registered in Mumbai, India, to Siemens Group."
"The intention is to sell 
18% of the interest in Siemens Ltd., India, for a anticipated cash 
purchase price of €2.1 billion."
"Consequently, Siemens Energy’s interest 
in the investment, which had a carrying value of €437 million as of 
September 30, 2023, would be reduced by 75%, leading to a material 
gain from disposal."
"The transaction is expected to close in Decem-
ber 2023."
"In addition, Siemens Energy intends to use its 5% share-
holding in Siemens Ltd."
India as collateral for guarantees.
"If the colla-
teral is drawn, Siemens Group would be obligated to buy up to 5% of 
shares in Siemens Ltd."
"Siemens Energy and 
Siemens Group have also agreed to propose to the Board of Directors of 
Siemens Ltd."
India a demerger of the energy business.
"Siemens Energy 
is to ultimately acquire a controlling stake in the demerged energy 
business."
"In 
mid-November 2023, the German government agreed that it will 
counter-guarantee €7.5 billion of a total amount of €12 billion of 
guarantees, of which €11 billion are to be provided to Siemens Energy 
by a consortium of banks."
"In return, the federal government will receive 
a standard market payment from Siemens Energy."
"The remaining 
€1 billion will be provided by an additional consortium led by Deutsche 
Bank."
"In addition, Siemens Energy and Siemens Group agreed on a 
structure which covers the bank’s theoretical default risk from the 
guarantees."
"Up to €1 billion would be covered by a share and cash 
collateral, the first of which includes the 5% shareholding in 
Siemens Ltd."
"Siemens Energy considers the signing of the 
agreements for the additional guarantee lines highly likely."
"The signing 
is expected for December 2023."

"In addition, we have audited the group

management report of Siemens Energy AG, for the fiscal year from

"322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has 
not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management 
report."
"Basis for the opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of 
the group management report in accordance with Sec."
"317 HGB and 
the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as 
“EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the 
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] 
(IDW)."
"In conducting the audit of the consolidated financial statements, 
we also complied with International Standards on Auditing (ISA)."
"Our 
responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are 
further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management 
report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group 
entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and 
German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our 
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Art."
"10 (2) f) of the EU 
Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit 
services prohibited under Art."
5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.
"We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated 
financial statements and on the group management report."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, 
were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 
2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters."
"Revenue from long-term construction contracts 
is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, generally over time under the percentage-of-completion 
method."
"Revenues, 
total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate 
significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about 
cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a 
construction contract, leading to the need to recognize onerous loss 
provisions."
"Auditor’s response: As part of our audit, we obtained an 
understanding of the Group’s internally established methods, processes 
and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and 
execution phase of construction contracts."
"We also tested internal controls on management 
level including project reviews and controls addressing the timely 
assessment of changes in cost estimates and the capture of warranty 
costs as well as the timely and complete recognition of such changes in 
the project calculation."
"As part of our 
substantive audit procedures, we evaluated management’s estimates 
and assumptions based on a risk-based selection of a sample of 
contracts."
"Based on the requirements of IFRS 15, we also assessed the accounting 
effects of contract amendments, contractually agreed options and the 
sanctions imposed against Russia."
"To identify anomalies in the development 
of margins throughout the projects’ execution, we also applied data 
analysis procedures."
"Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third 
parties for selected projects (e.g., project acceptance documentation, 
contractual terms and conditions, and legal confirmations regarding 
alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims)."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to 
revenue recognition on construction contracts."
"Accounting for quality issues at Siemens Gamesa  
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: 
In fiscal year 2023, Siemens Gamesa incurred substantial cost increases 
in connection with quality issues in the onshore wind turbines business."
"Significant judgments and uncertainties therefore exist in 
connection with the estimates used as a basis for the recognition of 
warranty provisions and order-related costs to cover these risks."
"As a result of the quality issues that occurred, the failure of components 
of various wind turbine models was monitored continuously by the 
Company in the course of the fiscal year, in particular during the 
ongoing root cause analysis."
"The observed failures were higher than 
expected for certain components."
"The root cause analysis of the quality 
issues identified in fiscal year 2023 is still ongoing and is expected to be 
completed during the first half of fiscal year 2024."
"Management believes that new results within the next fiscal year might 
lead to adjustments of the expected failure rates and have material 
negative effects on net assets, financial position and results of 
operations."
"Auditor’s response: We obtained an understanding of the Group’s 
internal control environment, its processes and methods for calculating 
failure rates and repair costs as well as its recognition of warranty 
provisions and project-related costs."
"In this context, we obtained, inter alia, the report of an independent 
expert on the design and operating effectiveness of certain controls and 
on the extended review of certain controls over the determination of 
the warranty provisions and related project costs by management as 
audit evidence."
"The report also related to the relevant processes of the 
Enterprise Risk Management system."
"Our audit also included the 
assessment of the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the 
independent expert and the suitability of the report commissioned by 
management as audit evidence."
"In addition, with the assistance of our statistics specialists, we 
performed substantive audit procedures and applied quantitative and 
risk-based criteria to select a sample of quality issues."
"In the course of our audit procedures, we checked in particular the 
expected failure rates, the population of components and wind turbine 
models affected by quality issues, the expected repair costs and cash 
outflows in the fiscal year as well as the discount rates."
"We interviewed technical experts and accounting 
employees about the quality issues, including the significant 
assumptions, during on-site appointments at the service and onshore 
headquarters of Siemens Gamesa."
"We have continuously updated our 
understanding from the inquiries of the technical experts during the 
subsequent event period until the completion of our audit."
"In addition, we assessed the disclosures on the quality issues at Siemens 
Gamesa in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the 
presentation in the group management report."
"Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the 
assessment of the accounting for quality issues at Siemens Gamesa."
"For the provisions, 
refer to Note 14 “Provisions” in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"Particularly the assumptions related to the long-term 
development of the underlying earnings contributions are subject to 
judgment and have a significant impact on the recoverability of 
goodwill."
"In this context, as part of our audit procedures, we also 
assessed management’s assumptions regarding the guarantees 
available for new orders."
"To test the plausibility of the allocation of goodwill to the new cash-
generating units as of October 1, 2022, we also made use of the value 
in use ranges determined by independent experts and assessed the 
considerations presented to us by the Company in terms of 
methodology."
"Our audit also included the assessment of the competence, capabilities 
and objectivity of the independent expert and the suitability of the 
opinions commissioned by management as audit evidence."
"We also assessed the disclosures on goodwill in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements."
"Additional information 148 
 
Siemens Energy – Annual Report 2023 
 
Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations concerning the 
assessment of impairment testing of goodwill."
"Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and 
measurement policies applied for the impairment test of goodwill, refer 
to Note 2 “Material accounting policies and critical accounting 
estimates” and Note 9 “Goodwill” in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"Uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes 
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: 
Siemens Energy operates in numerous countries with different local tax 
legislation."
"The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as 
deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable 
judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a 
key audit matter."
"In particular, this affects the measurement and 
completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets as well as the measurement and completeness of deferred 
tax liabilities."
"We consider the recoverability of deferred tax assets to be an area 
posing a significant risk of material misstatement and accordingly a key 
audit matter."
"This relates in particular to companies and tax groups with 
significant deferred tax assets in Germany, the USA and Spain."
"Auditor’s response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who 
have knowledge of relevant local tax law, we examined the processes 
installed by management and obtained an understanding of internal 
controls for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax 
positions."
"In the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, 
we evaluated whether management’s assessment of the tax 
implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 
2023 was in compliance with the respective local tax law."
"We involved 
transfer pricing specialists to examine tax consequences from cross-
border transactions, such as determination of transfer prices."
"In order 
to 
assess 
measurement 
and 
completeness, 
we 
interviewed 
management regarding findings from ongoing tax field audits and 
ongoing reviews of the transfer pricing system with the assistance of 
external experts and obtained confirmations from external tax advisors."
"Further, we evaluated management’s assessments regarding the 
prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings using 
confirmations from external tax advisors and by considering current tax 
case law."
"We assessed the recoverability of deferred tax assets using the audit 
evidence of taxable temporary differences, forecast taxable profits and 
using tax planning and tax planning strategies."
"In cases of a 
recent history of losses, we reviewed the assessment by management 
of the evidence required by IAS 12 of sufficient future taxable profits 
and assessed this for plausibility (transparency, consistency, 
coherence)."
"We also analyzed the (negative) tax rate taking into 
account tax profits or losses in Germany and abroad."
"Regarding the realization of tax deductions, we also analyzed any legal 
restrictions on the use of tax interest and loss carryforwards and tax 
assets."
"We assessed the effect of tax planning strategies on the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets using the status of their 
implementation and economic impact."
"In the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities, 
we examined in particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of 
subsidiaries’ retained profits for an indefinite period and assessed these 
taking into account dividend planning."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the 
accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes."
"Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and 
measurement policies applied in accounting for income taxes, refer to 
Note 2 “Material accounting policies and critical accounting 
estimates” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"With 
respect to disclosures for deferred tax assets and liabilities, refer to

statements."

aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated

"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit."
"The

"On the basis of

significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the 
prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the 
prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not express

"10 of the EU Audit 
Regulation 
We were elected as group auditor by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 
on February 7, 2023."
"We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on 
February 7, 2023."
"We have been the group auditor of Siemens Energy 
AG without interruption since the fiscal year from October 1, 2019 to 
September 30, 2020."
"We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are 
consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee pursuant 
to Art."
11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).
"OTHER MATTER – USE OF THE AUDITOR’S REPORT 
Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the audited

"In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained 
therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents 
made available in electronic form."
"GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
ENGAGEMENT 
The German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Katharina 
Breitsameter."
"MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES 
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the 
preparation of the non-financial statement in accordance with Sec."
"315c 
in 
conjunction 
with 
Secs."
"These responsibilities of the Company’s legal representatives include 
the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting 
methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-
financial disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the 
circumstances."
"Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible 
for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable 
the preparation of a non-financial statement that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipulation of the non-financial 
statement) or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted 
thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to 
considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications 
have not yet been published in every case."
"Therefore, the legal 
representatives have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section “EU 
taxonomy” of the non-financial statement."
"They are responsible for the 
defensibility of this interpretation."
"Due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal 
conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties."
"INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY ASSURANCE OF THE 
AUDITOR’S FIRM 
We have complied with the German professional requirements on 
independence as well as other professional conduct requirements."
"RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE AUDITOR  
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on 
the non-financial statement based on our assurance engagement."
"We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information” issued by the International Auditing 
and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB)."
"This standard requires that we 
plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited 
assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that 
cause us to believe that the Company’s non-financial statement is not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Sec."
"315c in 
conjunction with Secs."
"289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the 
interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section “EU 
taxonomy” of the non-financial statement."
"In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less 
extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and 
accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained."
"The 
selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional 
judgment of the auditor."
"In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation, the legal representatives are required to 
interpret undefined legal terms."
"Due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal 
conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance 
engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties."
"315c in conjunction with 
Secs."
"289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the 
Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation by the 
legal representatives as disclosed in section “EU taxonomy” of the group 
non-financial statement."
"RESTRICTION OF USE 
We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was 
conducted for the Company’s purposes and that the report is intended 
solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance 
engagement."
"As a result, it may not be suitable for another purpose 
than the aforementioned."
"Accordingly, the report is not intended to be 
used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it."
"Our 
responsibility is to the Company alone."
"We do not accept any 
responsibility to third parties."
"Our assurance conclusion is not modified 
in this respect."
"In 
addition, please refer to the liability provisions contained there in no."
"9 
and to the exclusion of liability towards third parties."
"We accept no 
responsibility, liability or other obligations towards third parties unless 
we have concluded a written agreement to the contrary with the 
respective third party or liability cannot effectively be precluded."
"We make express reference to the fact that we will not update the 
report to reflect events or circumstances arising after it was issued, 
unless required to do so by law."
"It is the sole responsibility of anyone 
taking note of the summarized result of our work contained in this 
report to decide whether and in what way this information is useful or 
suitable for their purposes and to supplement, verify or update it by 
means of their own review procedures."
"While the Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Transfor-
mation of Industry Business Areas are making excellent progress and 
are operating with top growth and margins, the Group suffered a 
severe, unexpected setback with Siemens Gamesa in the past fiscal 
year."
This had a negative impact on the entire company.
"Considerable 
startup problems with new products in the onshore sector and 
significant additional costs in the ramp-up of offshore activities over-
shadowed the success of the other businesses and resulted in a record 
loss for Siemens Energy overall."
"In view of the scope of the issue and the resulting burden on the entire 
company, the Supervisory Board immediately set up a special 
committee to provide management with detailed support in the search 
for the causes of the quality and productivity problems, and their solu-
tions."
"The Supervisory Board has asked management to fundamentally 
revise the strategy and business plan for the wind power business."
"The 
Executive Board already presented next steps at the Capital Market Day 
on November 21."
"In contrast to the tense situation in the wind business, Siemens Energy’s 
conventional energy business achieved excellent results in the period 
under review."
"By 2025, at least three gigawatts 
of electrolysis capacity are to be brought onto the market from there 
every year."
"With this installed capacity, an average of 300,000 tons of 
green hydrogen can be produced each year using renewable energies."
"If this hydrogen is used as a substitute for fossil fuels, it could be 
possible to save the CO₂ emissions of a major German city like Aachen 
with around 260,000 inhabitants – a real contribution to greater 
sustainability."
"Siemens Energy also pursues consistent sustainability targets in its own 
operations: In the past fiscal year, the company was already able to 
halve its emissions compared to the base year 2019."
"In the meantime, 
100% of the electricity consumed in its own operations is generated 
from renewable sources."
"This puts the company fully on track to meet 
the COP21 targets."
"Siemens Energy is very well positioned to make an important contribu-
tion to the global energy transition."
"Our technologies make it possible 
to reduce emissions and at the same time ensure a sustainable, reliable 
and competitive energy supply."
"But it is also true that the wind busi-
ness, which is very important for the energy transition, has presented 
the company with its greatest challenge to date."
"Great focus must be 
given to solving this task reliably and economically."
"In the current fiscal year, it is important to continue the successes in the 
conventional segment, stabilize Siemens Gamesa’s business and limit 
operating losses."
"In addition, a strategy must be implemented which, 
based on manageable risks, enables medium-term earnings that do not 
dilute the Group’s margins."
"Based on this, the company can play to its 
strengths in the businesses with conventional and renewable energy 
technology as well as important future technologies such as hydrogen."
"This must go hand in hand with above-average value creation for share-
holders."
"The Supervisory Board supports these plans of the Executive 
Board and shares the view that the core spectrum of Siemens Energy 
represents a competitive advantage in an attractive industry."
"Energy supply is the basis for the success of any economy – anywhere 
in the world."
"This development gained further momentum in the past 
fiscal year due to geopolitical and geostrategic developments."
"The glo-
bal energy landscape is changing, and with it the focus in the “energy 
policy triangle” of security of supply, economic efficiency and environ-
mental impact."
"Ensuring a stable, environmentally friendly and afford-
able energy supply remains one of the greatest challenges of our time."
"At the same time, it offers Siemens Energy a great opportunity to parti-
cipate in the “energy” supercycle successfully and in a value-creating 
manner."
"For shareholders, it opens up attractive potential for apprecia-
tion in value."
"On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the Executive 
Board and the approximately 94,000 colleagues at Siemens Energy 
worldwide for their outstanding commitment in the past fiscal year."
"Above all, I would also like to thank our customers and partners world-
wide."
"Special thanks also go to our shareholders for their loyalty in what 
was a particularly challenging year for them."
"In doing so, the Super-
visory Board continually advised and monitored the Executive Board in 
managing the Company, providing advice and assistance especially on 
issues of strategic importance for the continuing development of the 
Company."
"This was based above all on the detailed oral and written re-
ports presented by the Executive Board at meetings of the Supervisory 
Board and its Committees and on the written reports submitted to the 
Supervisory Board between meetings."
"The Executive Board provided 
the Supervisory Board with ongoing information about the significant 
business developments seen by the Company and its business areas, 
the course of business, the situation of the Company, the key financial 
data, the planned business policy and corporate planning."
"It also re-
ported regularly about the macroeconomic situation, the Company’s 
profitability and liquidity situation, the revenue and order position, 
trends in sales and procurement markets, developments on the capital 
markets and share price performance."
"On an ongoing basis, the Execu-
tive Board reported on the risk exposure, the audit activities conducted 
by Internal Audit, compliance issues and the latest developments in 
significant legal disputes."
"Regular features of reporting included the 
economic and political environment, the status of occupational safety 
at the Company and the corporate structure (Project Volt) introduced 
on October 1, 2022."
"In the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board focused particularly on the 
situation and performance capabilities of Siemens Gamesa, as well as 
on the purchase of the shares held by the remaining Siemens Gamesa 
shareholders and the associated financing issues."
"These matters were 
discussed in detail at almost all Supervisory Board meetings."
"The Super-
visory Board discussed the strategic alignment of the Company in 
depth, especially in respect of the wind business."
"Moreover, deep dives 
were included at all meetings to provide the Supervisory Board with de-
tailed insights into the various business areas of Siemens Energy and 
the regions in which the Company is active."
"The Supervisory Board and its Committees were involved in all decisions 
of fundamental importance at an early stage."
"The 
meetings of the Supervisory Board and its Committees were character-
ized by an open and constructive exchange of views between the 
members of the Supervisory Board and also between the Supervisory 
Board and the Executive Board."
"The Supervisory Board critically 
reviewed the reports and proposed resolutions of the Executive Board, 
ensuring in this process the lawfulness, fitness for purpose and compli-
ance of the Company’s management."
"The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chair of the Audit 
Committee were in regular contact with the Executive Board outside 
the Supervisory Board meetings."
"The Chairman of the Executive Board 
provided information on events that are significant to the Company 
without delay, regardless of the schedule of meetings."
"The Supervisory 
Board also met regularly without the Executive Board in attendance."
"At 
such meetings, it discussed in particular matters concerning the Execu-
tive Board itself or internal Supervisory Board matters."
"Prior to the ordi-
nary meetings of the Supervisory Board, separate preparatory meetings 
were held with both the shareholder and employee representatives."
"In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board held virtual and 
face-to-face meetings with institutional investors and proxy advisors in 
order to discuss current governance and sustainability issues being 
dealt with by the Supervisory Board."
"These discussions focused on the 
acquisition of Siemens Gamesa, the format of the Shareholders’ 
Meeting and resolutions in respect of capital measures."
"The Chairman 
of the Supervisory Board presented a summary of his discussions with 
investors to the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board."

"Rather than regarding the recommended maximum number of 
mandates for Executive Board and Supervisory Board members as a 
fixed upper limit, a judgment on whether the number of relevant 
mandates is appropriate as defined by the Code should be made on

"This assessment should consider the antici-
pated workload arising from the accepted mandates, which may 
differ from case to case."

"As per recommendation 
C.2, an age limit shall be specified for members of the Supervisory

not, per se, a criterion that would rule out the candidate’s suitability."

members contribute to the Board’s diversity."

that is diverse and comprises individuals who complement one another 
in an Executive Board that brings different perspectives to the 
management of the Company."

25% of the Executive Board positions are to be held by women by

business areas that are important for Siemens Energy, namely ener-
gy generation, energy transmission, engineering and construction."

numerous countries and global customer and supplier bases."
"Therefore, the composition of the Executive Board should take into 
account internationality of its members in the sense of different 
cultural backgrounds or international experience."
"The aim is to 
ensure that there is intercultural openness and the corresponding 
understanding and ability to assess international issues and contexts 
within the Executive Board."

Executive Board 
The diversity concept for the Executive Board is implemented as part of 
the process for making appointments to the Executive Board by the 
Supervisory Board."
"When selecting candidates and/or making proposals 
for the appointment of Executive Board members, the Supervisory 
Board and the Presiding Committee of the Supervisory Board take into 
account the requirements defined in the diversity concept for the 
Executive Board."
"The current composition of the Executive Board fulfills the diversity con-
cept adopted by the Supervisory Board."
"The members of the Executive 
Board cover a broad spectrum of knowledge and experience and exhibit 
diversity with regard to professional and educational background in the 
Executive Board’s current composition."
"The Executive Board has all the 
knowledge and experience that is considered essential in view of the 
activities of Siemens Energy."
"All Executive Board members have inter-
national experience."
"The various career paths and personalities within 
the Executive Board reflect the complex tasks it faces."
"At the end of fiscal year 2023, the Executive Board comprised two wo-
men and four men."
"The proportion of women on the Executive Board 
thus met the target of 25% set by the Supervisory Board and the 
minimum participation requirement specified by Germany’s Second 
Management Positions Act."
"The average age of the Executive Board 
members stood at 49 years at the end of fiscal year 2023, whereby the 
youngest member was 41, and the oldest member 54 years old."
"No 
Executive Board member was older than 63 years of age during the 
reporting period."
"Jointly with the Executive Board and with the support of the Presiding 
Committee, the Supervisory Board conducts long-term succession plan-
ning for the Executive Board."
"Taking account of the specific qualification 
requirements and the aforementioned criteria, the Presiding 
Committee develops an ideal profile on the basis of which it compiles a 
short-list of available candidates."
"• Personality and integrity  
Each member of the Supervisory Board shall have the personality and

"Serving as chair of a Supervisory Board 
counts twice."

"• Diversity/internationality  
Siemens Energy is an open and innovative company that operates 
globally with a workforce stemming from numerous countries and a 
global customer and supplier base."
"With regard to the composition 
of the Supervisory Board, attention shall accordingly be paid to 
achieving sufficient diversity."
"In particular, this includes diversity in 
terms of cultural background and differences in educational and 
professional backgrounds, experience and ways of thinking."
"Having 
this in mind, the Supervisory Board shall include an appropriate 
number of members possessing international experience, so as to 
ensure that there is intercultural openness and the corresponding 
understanding, as well as the ability to assess international issues 
and contexts."
"Diversity also includes the appropriate representation of the genders 
on the Supervisory Board."
"Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation 
Act, a Supervisory Board that is subject to co-determination must be 
made up of at least 30% women and at least 30% men."
"The Nomina-
tion Committee shall include at least one female member."
"• Independence 
The Supervisory Board shall include an appropriate number of mem-
bers representing the shareholders who are independent as deter-
mined by the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"At least six shareholder representatives shall be independent of the 
Company and the Executive Board."
"The Chair of the Supervisory 
Board and the Chair of the Audit Committee shall be independent."
"Supervisory Board members shall not be members of governing 
bodies of, or exercise advisory functions at significant competitors 
and shall not hold a personal relationship with a significant compe-
titor."
"No more than two former members of the Executive Board of 
Siemens Energy AG shall belong to the Supervisory Board."
"Most recently, the Supervisory Board 
and the Nominating Committee have considered the relevant object-
tives, including the skills profile and the diversity concept, when 
proposing the candidates for the election of the shareholder represen-
tatives at the 2021 Shareholders’ Meeting."
"When proposing new Supervisory Board members for election by the 
Shareholders’ Meeting, the Nominating Committee of the Supervisory 
Board will make sure that the candidates have sufficient time to per-
form their duties."
"The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that, with its current compo-
sition, it meets the objectives for its composition and fulfills the profile 
of required skills and expertise as well as the diversity concept."
"The Supervisory Board members have the specialist and personal quali-
fications considered necessary."
"As a group, they are familiar with the 
sector in which the Company operates and have the knowledge, skills, 
and experience essential for Siemens Energy."
"A considerable number of 
Supervisory Board members are engaged in international activities 
and/or have many years of international experience."
"Appropriate 
consideration has been given to diversity in the Supervisory Board."
"In 
fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board comprised six women, four of 
which among the shareholder representatives and two among the 
employee representatives."
"That results in a ratio of 30% female mem-
bers on the Supervisory Board."
"Geisha Williams is a member of the Nom-
inating Committee."
"The implementation status is shown in detail in the below qualification 
matrix."
"In the assessment of the Supervisory Board, at least eight of the Super-
visory Board members representing the shareholders are independent 
and there are thus an appropriate number of independent members 
within the meaning of the Code."
"These Supervisory Board members are: 
Dr. Christine Bortenlänger, Joe Kaeser, Dr. Hubert Lienhard, Hildegard 
Müller, Laurence Mulliez, Sigmar Gabriel, Geisha Williams and Randy 
Zwirn."
"The regulation restricting the number of terms on the Super-
visory Board is complied with."

Professional ability

eas (esp."
The statements relating to professional ability are based on the Supervisory Board’s self-assessment.
"A check equals at least “good knowledge” and accordingly the ability to well understand the facts 
of a matter and to make informed decisions, based on already existing qualification and additional trainings undergone by the Supervisory Board members."
"On a scale from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest), this corresponds to a rating of at 
least 2."

"This work focused on reviewing 
and setting target compensation for members already serving on the 
Executive Board as well as for new members, while also evaluating the 
Executive Board’s targets for fiscal year 2023."
"In November 2022, Maria Ferraro and Tim Holt were reappointed ahead 
of time for further five-year terms as members of the Executive Board."
"Concurrent with the reappointment, the Supervisory Board reviewed 
their compensation."
"More than half of the adjustment was made in 
the long-term compensation component, Siemens Energy Stock 
Awards."
"For Tim Holt, whose place of employment is in the United 
States, the Supervisory Board agreed on a target compensation 
denominated in US Dollars to mitigate currency risks both for the 
Company and for him."
"Further, the Supervisory Board reviewed Dr.-Ing."
"Christian Bruch’s 
compensation – which had been unchanged since his initial 
appointment on May 1, 2020 – and approved a moderate adjustment 
oriented towards the long term."
"The newly appointed members of the 
Executive Board received market-appropriate target compensation that 
reflects their first-time appointment to the Executive Board."
"With the organizational structure introduced from October 1, 2022, 
each of Siemens Energy’s Business Areas, apart from Siemens Gamesa, 
is led by a member of the Executive Board."
"The Business Areas Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Transformation 
of Industry continued the positive trend from the previous year and 
again achieved solid progress toward meeting their mid-term goals."
"Each Business Area achieved or exceeded their communicated 
guidance for profitability."
"Generation of free cash flow was 
substantially better than expected in these Business Areas – and 
consequently also at the Group level."
"The outstanding performance in 
this area could even more than compensate for Siemens Gamesa 
substantially missing its target."
"The Business Areas’ strong financial results are reflected in the target 
attainment for Tim Holt, Karim Amin and Anne-Laure de Chammard’s 
short-term variable compensation."
"The Supervisory Board also sees the 
Business Areas, apart from Siemens Gamesa, on a positive or even very 
positive track with regard to operational performance and other key 
aspects like customer satisfaction."
"By contrast, Siemens Gamesa faced serious setbacks."
"In fiscal year 
2023, by fully acquiring Siemens Gamesa and initiating its integration, 
the Executive Board set the necessary strategic course to successfully 
turn around the business."
"However, following this, significant quality 
issues and ramp-up challenges came to light, which the Executive Board 
is addressing with a package of measures and the Supervisory Board is 
supporting through a special committee created specifically for this 
purpose."
"Nevertheless, substantially due to Siemens Gamesa, fiscal year 
2023 was not a satisfying year for our shareholders."
"This has a 
particularly strong impact on the long-term component of the Executive 
Board’s compensation."
"For example, the value of Siemens Energy Stock 
Awards tranches 2021, 2022 and 2023 is currently estimated at well 
under the target value."
"The setbacks owing to Siemens Gamesa are also 
acutely felt in short-term variable compensation for fiscal year 2023, 
most notably in the component Group Profit margin before Special 
Items, where target attainment is 0%."
"For fiscal year 2024, the Supervisory Board will continue to ensure that 
the Executive Board’s compensation reflects the performance of 
individual members and also as a group."
"Further, the Supervisory Board 
will be engaged with reviewing and improving the compensation 
system for the members of the Executive Board, with the goal of 
creating an even stronger alignment between performance and 
variable compensation."
"This will be accompanied a review of whether 
the compensation system should be addressed by a separate 
compensation committee."
"The compensation system will be presented 
to the Annual General Meeting 2025 for approval."
"This report should allow you, the shareholders, to have a transparent 
view of compensation for the Executive and Supervisory Boards."
"Like all 
of my colleagues on the Supervisory Board, in these challenging times 
I particularly value continued dialogue with you on this important issue."

panies."
"For fiscal year 2023, Karim Amin received approximately 56% 
of his total target compensation from Siemens Energy LLC (United Arab 
Emirates), and Tim Holt received around 33% of his total target com-
pensation from Siemens Energy Inc."
"Karim Amin 
received approximately 44% and Tim Holt approximately 67% of their 
respective total target compensation from Siemens Energy AG."
"The 
additional employment relationships with Siemens Energy Group com-
panies thus do not lead to any additional compensation."
"In accordance 
with Section 162 para."
"1 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the table 
“Compensation awarded or due” discloses the total compensation from 
all group companies."
"In the short-term variable compensation (Bonus) this 
is Profit Margin before Special Items as well as Free cash flow (pre-tax) 
and in the long-term variable compensation (Siemens Energy Stock 
Awards) relative total shareholder return and earnings per share."
"In 
addition, individual qualitative targets relating to the full acquisition 
and integration of Siemens Gamesa were set for Dr.-Ing."
"Christian Bruch 
and Maria Ferraro in their Bonus for fiscal year 2023."
"For fiscal year 2023, the target compensation for Dr.-Ing."
"Jochen 
Eickholt, 
the 
CEO 
of 
Siemens Gamesa, 
was 
set 
based 
on 
Siemens Gamesa’s existing compensation practices."
"This included 
targets in his short-term variable compensation that relate exclusively 
to Siemens Gamesa."
"Jochen Eickholt is not a member of 
Siemens Energy’s Executive Board and thus is not subject to reporting 
requirements according to Section 162 para 1 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act."
"Key elements of Executive Board compensation 
The compensation of the Executive Board in fiscal year 2023 complies 
with all applicable recommendations and suggestions in the version of 
the German Corporate Governance Code dated April 28, 2022."
"Sustainable orientation of compensation 
Within the variable compensation, a substantial portion is determined based on performance measurement over a 
multi-year period."
"The focus on sustainability is further strengthened by anchoring performance criteria reflecting 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in the long-term equity-based compensation."
"Alignment of performance and pay 
Exceptional performance should be rewarded appropriately in compensation."
"Performance under the established 
targets should lead to an appreciable reduction in compensation."
"Consistency of compensation systems 
throughout the organization 
The compensation system for members of the Executive Board is compatible with compensation systems for the 
management and employees of the Group."
"Appropriateness of compensation  
Executive Board members’ compensation is appropriate for the market and takes consideration of the Company’s 
size, complexity, and economic situation."
"As 
of 
September 30, 2023, 
Siemens Energy is a constituent of the DAX index, which comprises 40 
of the largest publicly listed German companies."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board takes account of Executive Board 
compensation in proportion to compensation for the workforce of 
Siemens Energy in Germany excluding Siemens Gamesa, including any 
changes over time."
"Composition of Executive Board compensation in 
fiscal year 2023 
Executive Board compensation comprises both fixed and variable 
components."
"Target 
compensation 
represents 
the 
level 
of 
compensation that is realized if all targets are met and the price of 
Siemens Energy’s shares remains constant."
"Target compensation there-
by sets incentives for strong performance by the Company, the 
Executive Board as a whole and by each member."
"Failing to reach 
targets can lead to a substantial reduction in compensation, as each 
member of the Executive Board’s target compensation is comprised 
mostly of variable compensation."
"For fixed compensation as well as short- and long-term variable com-
pensation, the compensation system for the members of the Executive 
Board defines ranges for each component as a percentage of total 
target compensation."
"The share of each compensation element was 
within the defined ranges for fiscal year 2023, as shown in the 
following table “Total target compensation fiscal year 2023”."
"The share 
of each compensation element disclosed in the table “Compensation 
awarded or due” can deviate from these figures according to the actual 
level of target attainment and the first transfer of Siemens Energy 
shares as part of the long-term variable compensation in fiscal 
year 2025."
"For the period up until the first transfer of a Stock Awards 
tranche, the relative share of variable compensation as a part of com-
pensation awarded or due will remain lower than its share of total 
target compensation."
"Changes to Executive Board target compensation 
for fiscal year 2023 
The Supervisory Board strives to set target compensation for members 
of the Executive Board that is appropriate for the market and attractive, 
in order to attract and retain the best executives for Siemens Energy."
"In 
fiscal year 2023, in addition to the appointment of two new members 
of the Executive Board, Anne-Laure de Chammard and Vinod Philip, the 
appointments of Maria Ferraro and Tim Holt were extended ahead of 
time."
"In this context, the Supervisory Board reviewed whether Exe-
cutive Board members’ target compensation reflected the importance 
and scope of their respective roles."
"This also included a review of market 
appropriateness by the Supervisory Board."
"Target compensation for Dr.-
Ing."
"Christian Bruch, Maria Ferraro and Tim Holt had not been changed 
since their initial appointment on May 1, 2020 (Dr.-Ing."
"Bruch, Ferraro) 
and April 1, 2020 (Holt)."
"The Supervisory Board approved the following adjustments: 
• Dr.-Ing."
"Christian Bruch: Increase of total target compensation by 
approximately 7.5% in line with a positioning of target 
compensation around the median of the DAX."
"To further strengthen 
long-term incentives, approximately 62% of the increase was 
conducted in the form of an increase to the target value for 
Siemens Energy Stock Awards."
"• Maria Ferraro: Increase of total target compensation by 
approximately 15% in connection with the extension of her 
appointment to the Executive Board until November 30, 2027."
"With 
the organizational structure for Siemens Energy introduced with 
effect from October 1, 2022 and the acquisition of Siemens Gamesa, 
the Chief Financial Officer’s role took on increased strategic 
importance and added operational responsibilities."
"This elevated role 
is reflected in target compensation for Maria Ferraro that is 
differentiated at a market-typical level."
"Approximately 55% of the 
adjustment to her compensation was made in the target value for 
Siemens Energy Stock Awards."
"• Tim Holt: The United States is Tim Holt’s place of employment, and 
his area of responsibility includes Siemens Energy Inc., a subsidiary 
of Siemens Energy in the United States."
"In connection with his 
reappointment as a member of the Executive Board until Novem-
ber 30, 2027, his compensation was contractually set in US Dollars."
"Target compensation for fiscal year 2023 (in US Dollars) was 
increased by approximately 1% compared with his total target 
compensation in 2021 and 2022 (in US Dollars)."
"Due to exchange 
rate fluctuations, the value of his compensation in Euros can deviate 
from year to year."
• Karim Amin: Increase in base salary of 5%.
"This corresponds to an 
increase in total target compensation (on a full-year basis) of 
approximately 1%."
"The following table shows the contractually agreed total target 
compensation for fiscal year 2023."
"2 
Disclosed values for Dr.-Ing."
Christian Bruch represent his target compensation for the entire fiscal year 2023.
"An adjusted target compensation took effect for him from December 1, 2022."
"This amounts to €1,515,000 for base 
salary, €1,515,000 for his Bonus and €2,170,000 for Siemens Energy Stock Awards."
"3 
Beginning with fiscal year 2023, Tim Holt’s target compensation is agreed upon in US Dollars."
"Base salary = $890,000; Pension Substitute for fiscal year 2023 = $295,000; Bonus = $850,000; Siemens Energy Stock Awards = 
$1,130,000."
Conversion into Euros is conducted for the base salary and fringe benefits using the respective monthly average Euro-US Dollar exchange rate.
"The Bonus and Pension Substitute are converted using the average 
exchange rate during fiscal year 2023 (€1 = $1.0676)."
"Conversion of the target value for Siemens Energy Stock Awards is conducted on the basis of the Euro-US Dollar exchange rate on the grant date for the tranche (for tranche 
2023, 1 € = 1,0412 $)."
Any contributions to retirement plans that Tim Holt receives as part of his employment with Siemens Energy Inc.
are offset against the pension substitute.
"The value of contributions owed to these retirement 
plans for fiscal year 2023 amounted to $181,079 (€169,614 at the average exchange rate during fiscal year 2023 (€1 = $1.0676)."
"4 
With exception of base salary paid by Siemens Energy LLC (UAE), Karim Amin’s compensation is paid out in Euros."
Base salary paid by Siemens Energy LLC (UAE) is paid in UAE dirham in accordance with local regulations.
"A correction 
is performed at the end of the fiscal year to ensure that the compensation paid out in UAE dirhams corresponds to the target compensation in Euros."
The average monthly Euro-Dirham exchange rate is applied for conversions.
"5 
Pro-rata target compensation for fiscal year 2023 (11/12 months)."
"At the beginning of her appointment as a member of the Executive Board, Anne-Laure de Chammard received a payment of €1,872,064 to compensate for forfeited 
remuneration from her previous employer."
Anne-Laure de Chammard contractually agreed to immediately invest the entire net proceeds from this compensatory payment in Siemens Energy shares.
"On December 12, 2022, Anne-
Laure de Chammard conducted this investment by purchasing 58,850 Siemens Energy shares at an average price of €16.75."
"Limits on individual compensation elements 
At the beginning of the fiscal year the Supervisory Board sets a maxi-
mum value in Euro for each compensation element."
"Base salary and 
pension substitute are defined as a fixed amount and can therefore not 
amount to a higher value."
"Short-term and long-term variable compen-
sation are capped at 150% and 250% of the target value in Euro, 
respectively."
"For fringe benefits, the Supervisory Board sets a maximum monetary 
value – based on a percentage of base salary – at the beginning of the 
fiscal year for each member of the Executive Board."
"The Supervisory 
Board set maximum value of 8% of base salary for fiscal year 2023."
"According to the compensation system, this limit can be increased, in 
particular in the event of an Executive Board member having their place 
of employment outside of Germany."
"The maximum value for Anne-
Laure de Chammard was increased by €450,000 to account for benefits 
granted in connection with the maintenance of a second residence."
"Further, the Supervisory Board approved an increase of the maximum 
value of benefits for Maria Ferraro by €50,000 to account for benefits 
granted to her on an individual basis prior to the Spin-Off of 
Siemens Energy."
"These are typical benefits for an Executive Board mem-
ber working internationally, for example, reimbursement of tax advi-
sory expenses."
"Compliance with maximum compensation as defined by 
Section 87a German Stock Corporation Act 
The Supervisory Board sets a binding annual maximum compensation 
amount for each member of the Executive Board, in line with 
Section 87a para."
1 of the German Stock Corporation Act.
"The 
final value of compensation for a particular fiscal year can only be 
determined after vesting occurs for the Stock Awards tranche granted 
for that fiscal year."
"Consequently, this will be possible for the tranche 
of Stock Awards granted in fiscal year 2023 in November 2026."
"Maxi-
mum compensation for Anne-Laure de Chammard for fiscal year 2023 
thus amounts to €6.2 million."
"Compliance with maximum compensation according to 
Section 87a of the German Stock Corporation Act for fiscal year 2023 is 
thus assured."
"1 German Stock 
Corporation Act 
Dr.-Ing."
"The vesting period for the Stock Awards Tranche 2023 
ends in November 2026; if target attainment is greater than 0%, Siemens Energy shares will be transferred to the respective member of the Executive Board."
"A final review of compliance with the maximum compensation will occur 
at this time."

Compensation awarded or due for Anne-Laure de Chammard includes a compensatory payment of €1,872,064 to compensate for the forfeiture of remuneration owed by her previous employer."

Variable compensation elements in fiscal year 2023 
Short-term variable compensation (Bonus) 
A substantial portion of Executive Board members’ compensation is tied 
to the Siemens Energy Group’s annual performance (Bonus)."
"The final 
payout amount depends on the attainment of financial and non-finan-
cial targets."
"However, the overall payout amount is limited to 150% of 
the target amount (cap)."
"Targets are divided into three equally-
weighted components: two financial performance criteria – for fiscal 
year 2023 Profit margin before Special Items and Free cash flow (FCF) 
pre-tax – as well as individual targets, which can be either financial or 
non-financial in nature."
"Profit margin before Special Items and FCF pre-

the 
short-term 
financial 
performance 
of 
the 
Siemens Energy Group."
"For fiscal year 2023, members of the Executive Board with direct

To calculate the Profit margin before Special items, Profit before Special items is divided by total revenue."
"Profit is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, interest income and expenses, and other financial income (expenses), 
net, adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments."
"To increase comparability year-on-year, we use Profit before Special items."
"Special items refer to the following topics: 
1) Restructuring and integration costs: Restructuring costs refer to personnel measures leading to severance charges, including costs for terminating service contracts with Siemens Group (Siemens AG and its subsidiaries)."
"Due to 
the further integration of Siemens Gamesa and the objective of a consistent presentation within the Group, only personnel-related measures for restructuring will be included for Siemens Gamesa from fiscal year 2023, in contrast 
to the past."
Integration costs that occur at Siemen Gamesa are related to the integration of companies as well as in the course of the integration of Siemens Gamesa into the Group and the corresponding transaction costs.
"2) Stand-
alone costs relate to the separation from Siemens Group and the formation of Siemens Energy as an independent enterprise."
"3) Major asset impairments and write-downs (as well as any subsequent reversals) related to strategic 
portfolio decisions."
"2 
Free cash flow (FCF) pre tax of the Group is defined as cash flows from operating activities before income taxes paid, less additions to intangible asset and property, plant and equipment."
"Free cash flow of the segments (Business 
Areas) constitutes cash flows from operating less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment."
"3 
The amount paid out for Tim Holt was determined in US Dollars ($869,040) and converted into Euros for purposes of disclosure (conversion according to the average Euro-US Dollar exchange rate during fiscal year 2023: €1 = 
$1.0676)."
"For fiscal 
year 2023, the Supervisory Board placed a focus on two important 
aspects of sustainable management: health & safety and customer 
satisfaction."
"Additionally, the members of the Executive Board received 
two targets reflecting the current priorities of their respective port-
folios."
"Non-financial individual targets, which are weighted within the 
individual targets at 25% each (that is, within the Bonus as a whole a 
weighting of 8.33% each), were determined at the beginning of the 
fiscal year."
"The Supervisory Board evaluated the attainment of these 
targets in a multi-step process."
"First, each member of the Executive 
Board submitted a detailed self-evaluation."
"In the next step, the Chair-
man of the Presiding Committee conducted a preliminary evaluation 
based on these self-evaluations and an assessment of the Executive 
Board’s work prepared by the President and CEO."
"With this as a founda-
tion, the Presiding Committee of the Supervisory Board discussed the 
Executive Board’s performance against the targets that had been set 
and proposed recommendations to the Supervisory Board."
"Each 
Stock Award confers the right to receive one Siemens Energy share."
"Stock Awards vest after a period of approximately four years, contin-
gent upon attaining pre-defined performance targets."
"The vesting 
period for the Tranche 2023 begins in November 2022 and ends in No-
vember 2026."
"At the end of the vesting period, members of the Executive Board are 
entitled to receive one Siemens Energy share at no cost for each Stock 
Award."
"The final number of Stock Awards is determined by the degree 
to which the established targets are achieved during the performance 
period."
"If the monetary value of the final number of Stock Awards 
exceeds 250% of the target amount (cap), a corresponding number of 
Stock Awards for the amount exceeding the cap will be forfeited 
without replacement."
"The 
difference in percentage points for 
Siemens Energy and respective index 
determines target attainment."
"The Supervisory Board defines a 100% target 
value for the average EPS from continuing 
operations over the four fiscal years of the 
vesting period, as well as EPS values 
representing 0% and 200% target attainment."
"Three equally weighted performance criteria 
for the ESG component are set at the begin-
ning of the Tranche."
"The Supervisory Board 
also sets quantitative target values that 
correspond to a target attainment of 0%, 100% 
and 200%."
"1/3 
Social (""S"") 
Employee engagement based on the Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS), which is determined based on a global 
survey of Siemens Energy’s employees."

Governance (""G"") 
Target for share of women in leadership positions (defined according to functional value) based on the Company’s 
long-term communicated target of 25% by 2025 and 30% by 2030."
Target setting for Siemens Energy excluding Siemens Gamesa.
"These baseline values served as the basis for target setting by the Supervisory Board and may slightly deviate from the figures reported in the Sustainability Report 
due to delays in internal reporting."
"In the compensation report for fiscal year 2022, the values under “Baseline value” represented the respective CO2 emissions including Siemens Gamesa (Tranche 2021: 292 kt; Tranche 
2022: 273 kt)."
"The relevant population for measuring the share of women in management includes functions defined based on functional value, which is represented by a function’s position classes (PC)."
"The population PC 64-72 comprises 
approximately 125 of the highest-rated functions in the former Gas & Power (GP) segment, The population PC 63-72 comprises approximately 180 of the highest-rated functions in the Siemens Energy Group, excluding 
Siemens Gamesa."
"For Tranche 2022, the population was changed in order to bring the basis for measurement in line with external and internal reporting."
"Because Siemens Energy 
Stock Awards were granted for the first time in November 2020, the 
first transfer of Siemens Energy shares will take place in Novem-
ber 2024, conditional upon the performance criteria described above 
being met."
"The fair market value at grant is determined according to 
“IFRS 2 – share-based compensation.” The grant price for all grants 
amounted to €15.61."

At the beginning of the vesting period of approximately four years, the maximum possible number of Stock Awards are conditionally granted."
"If target attainment is less than 200%, the number of Stock Awards is adjusted downward 
accordingly."
"2 
To determine the fair market value, target attainment of 200% is assumed for the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) component and 100% target attainment for the Earnings per Share (EPS) and Environmental, Social & Governance 
(ESG) components."
The fair market value at grant is calculated based on the date on which the terms and conditions of the grant were agreed upon.
"For the Tranche 2023, the relevant date for all members was December 13, 2022."
"For the Tranche 2022, the relevant date was December 10, 2021 for Dr.-Ing."
"Christian Bruch, Maria Ferraro and Tim Holt, and for September 20, 2022 for Karim Amin."
"For Tranche 2021, December 14, 2020 was the relevant date 
for all members of the Executive Board."
"3 
The vesting period of the Stock Awards Tranche 2023 [2022] (2021) ends on the day in November 2026 [2025] (2024) on which the financial results for fiscal year 2026 [2025] (2024) are published."
"In its meeting in November 2023, the Supervisory Board determined 
that it had no indication of circumstances that could lead to the 
application of malus or clawback rules."
"Consequently, the Supervisory 
Board did not make use of its authority to withhold or reclaim short-
term variable compensation in fiscal year 2023."
"Executive Board compensation levels in  
fiscal year 2023 
Compensation awarded or due 
The following table offers individual disclosure of compensation 
“awarded” or “due” to the members of the Executive Board according to 
the definition in Section 162 para."
"1 of the German Stock Corpora-
tion Act."
"These definitions have been added to the Stock Corporation 
Act with the entry into force of the Second Shareholder Rights Directive 
(SRD II) and supplant the definitions for compensation laid out in the 
German Corporate Governance Code."
"The Code no longer recommends 
use of the “sample tables” that were previously employed since 2014."
"Compensation awarded covers compensation that was paid out to the 
member of the Executive Board during a fiscal year, that is, became the 
Executive Board member’s personal assets."
"Compensation due refers to 
compensation that is owed but has not yet been paid out."
"For

Siemens Energy’s Executive Board compensation system, this means 
that short-term variable compensation that will be paid out in Janu-
ary 2024 is classified as “due” and disclosed as compensation for fiscal 
year 2023."
"On the other hand, long-term variable compensation can only be 
potentially paid out after the end of a Stock Awards tranche’s vesting 
period with the transfer of Siemens Energy shares to the member of the 
Executive Board."
"Disclosure as compensation awarded or due occurs 
therefore at the time at which this transfer takes place."
"Payout from the Stock Awards tranche 2023, which was granted in No-
vember 2022 and will be transferred in November 2026 after determi-
nation of the level of target attainment, will consequently be disclosed 
for fiscal year 2027."

"Christian Bruch, the disclosed values for fiscal year 2022 include the value of security installations in regularly used homes and rental properties for the members of the Executive Board, including any tax gross-ups 
covered by the Company."
These were carried out by Siemens Energy in accordance with the Company’s current executive security policy.
"The monetary value of these installations, including tax gross-ups covered by the Company, 
are excluded from the maximum value of fringe benefits defined at the beginning of the fiscal year."
"For fiscal year 2022, these amounted to €53,697 for Dr.-Ing."

The Supervisory Board decided to grant Dr.-Ing."
Christian Bruch and Maria Ferraro a pension substitute in cash for fiscal year 2022 as well as fiscal year 2023.
This is typically paid out in January of the following year.
"Conversion into Euros for disclosure purposes is done for base salary ($890,000) and fringe benefits ($51,118) using the respective 
monthly average Euro-US Dollar exchange rate."
"The Bonus ($869,040) is converted according to the average exchange rate during the fiscal year (€1 = $1.0676)."
"For fiscal year 2022, Tim Holt’s target compensation was defined

The Supervisory Board decided for fiscal year 2022 and for fiscal year 2023 to grant Tim Holt and Karim Amin a pension substitute in cash."
This is typically paid out in January of the following year.
"Tim Holt accrued the right to

for fiscal year 2022 (€1 = $1.0841)."
"For fiscal year 2023, contributions to US retirement plans were subtracted from the pension substitute granted ($295,000), such that the difference of €113,921 (€106,707) was paid out."

The Supervisory Board decided to grant Dr.-Ing."
Jochen Eickholt a pension substitute in cash for fiscal year 2022.
This was paid out on a pro-rata basis concurrently with his departure from the Executive Board in February 2022.
"2 
With his departure from the Executive Board of Siemens Energy and in order to maintain his independence in the role as CEO of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A., all unvested Siemens Energy Stock Awards for Dr.-Ing."
Jochen Eickholt were settled in cash (tranches 2021 and 2022).
A target attainment of 100% and the average price of the Siemens Energy share during January 2022 (€21.52) were used for the calculation of the cash settlement.
"The cash settlement amounted to €1,398,800."
"Additional disclosures on Executive Board 
compensation in fiscal year 2023 
Retirement benefits 
For fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board elected to make use of its 
option to grant the members of the Executive Board an unrestricted 
cash payment (“pension substitute”)."
"Alternatively, the compensation 
system provides the option for the members of the Executive Board to 
participate in the Company’s pension plan (“BSAV”), under which the 
Company can grant contributions – defined as a fixed amount in Euro 
– to a member’s pension account."
"Maria Ferraro has a pension commitment under the BSAV that was 
transferred from Siemens AG to Siemens Energy in connection with the 
Company’s Spin-Off."
"The Company has not made any contributions to 
Maria Ferraro’s pension account since it was transferred."
"Her pension 
account is credited with an annual interest payment (guaranteed 
interest) on January 1st of each year."
"The guaranteed interest rate is 
currently 0.25%."
"As of September 30, 2023, the defined benefit obligation for Maria 
Ferraro’s pension obligation according to IFRS amounted to 
€0.1 million."
"Share Ownership Guidelines 
According to Siemens Energy’s Share Ownership Guidelines, members 
of the Executive Board are required to hold Siemens Energy shares 
equal in value to a multiple of their base salary – 300% for the President 
and CEO and 200% for all other members."
"Base salary is defined as the 
respective member’s annual base salary for the month of September 
preceding the respective measurement date."
"Members of the Executive 
Board are allowed a build-up phase of approximately 4.5 years in order 
to acquire the required number of shares."
"If the value of the acquired 
shares falls below the holding requirement due to fluctuations in 
Siemens Energy’s share price, the members of the Executive Board must 
purchase additional shares."
"The first review of compliance with the requirements under the Share 
Ownership Guidelines will take place in March 2025 for Dr.-Ing."
"Christian Bruch, Maria Ferraro and Tim Holt, in October 2026 for Karim 
Amin, and in March 2027 for Anne-Laure de Chammard and Vinod 
Philip, each following the completion of the approximately 4.5-year 
build-up phase."
"Commitments in connection with early termination of the 
Executive Board mandate  
If an Executive Board member leaves the Executive Board during the 
fiscal year, the Bonus is paid out on a pro-rata basis on the regular 
payout date."
"The number of Stock Awards granted at the beginning of 
the fiscal year in which the member of the Executive Board exits is 
reduced on a pro-rata basis."
"Depending on the circumstances of the 
departure from the Executive Board, unvested Stock Award grants can 
remain in place, be forfeited without replacement or be settled in cash."
"A severance payment is typically made in the event of mutually agreed 
termination without cause."
"In line with the German Corporate 
Governance Code, this payment is limited to two years of annual 
compensation or the remaining value of the contract (“severance cap”)."
"There are no special provisions for the event that a change of control 
event occurs, that is, neither special rights to terminate the contract nor

severance payments."
"Further, Executive Board members’ employment 
contracts do not include any post-contractual non-competition clause 
and therefore also do not foresee any compensation for this case."
"Temporary deviations from the compensation system 
In exceptional circumstances, the Supervisory Board may deviate from 
the elements defined in the compensation system if this is deemed 
necessary for the Company’s long-term wellbeing."
"There were no 
deviations from the compensation system in fiscal year 2023."
"Siemens Gamesa’s performance, which has not met expec-
tations, is visible on the one hand in the short-term variable compen-
sation (Bonus) but has an even larger impact on long-term variable 
compensation."
"The first transfer of Siemens Energy Stock Awards will 
take place in November 2024 and will therefore be disclosed in the 
compensation report for fiscal year 2025."
"In order to presently guaran-
tee a high level of transparency, the table below employs Dr.-Ing."
"Christian Bruch as a representative example to demonstrate the course 
of target attainment in the Bonus over time as well as the “notional” 
value of unvested Siemens Energy Stock Awards tranches at transfer."
"Target attainment and notional value as a percentage of the target 
value apply to all members of the Executive Board who received a grant 
under the respective tranches, with the exception of the 2022 tranche 
for Karim Amin."
"The notional value as a percentage of target value for 
this grant is slightly higher due a lower fair market value at grant."
"The notional value represents the estimated monetary value of an 
unvested Siemens Energy Stock Awards tranche based on preliminary 
estimated target attainment (as of October 31, 2023) and the closing 
price of Siemens Energy’s shares as of October 31, 2023 (€8,37)."
"For all 
three unvested Siemens Energy Stock Awards tranches, the notional 
value at transfer is substantially below the respective target value."
"1 
Target attainment is calculated using a “best estimate” approach."
"For relative total shareholder return (TSR), target attainment is estimated for the respective pro-rata performance period (e.g."
"for the 2021 tranche of Siemens Energy 
Stock Awards, Siemens Energy’s TSR is compared with the two relevant comparison indices for the 24 months of the performance period already elapsed as of October 31, 2023)."
"For earnings per share, the target value (Ø of four 
fiscal years) is compared to an estimate comprising actuals for past fiscal years, the most recent forecast for the current fiscal year and budget values for the following fiscal year(s)."
"For targets on environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) metrics, the progress toward reaching targets is measured using linear interpolation (e.g."
"if the employee net promoter score over four years should improve from -5 to +5, a value of 0 after two fiscal years 
would correspond to an estimated target attainment of 100%)."
"1 
The notional value of a Stock Awards tranche is calculated based on the number of Siemens Energy Stock Awards granted, multiplied by the estimated target attainment as of October 31, 2023 and as well as Siemens Energy’s 
share price on October 31, 2023 (€8.37)."
"For all unvested tranches, the difference between the cumulative target values for Dr.-Ing."
"Christian Bruch and the estimated notional values amounts to €4,194,429."
"Preview of Executive Board compensation for 
fiscal year 2024 
The Supervisory Board annually selects performance criteria for the 
variable compensation for the upcoming fiscal year and also sets 
corresponding targets."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board continually 
reviews potential for improvement within the compensation system 
according to Section 87a of the German Stock Corporation Act that was 
approved by shareholders."
"For fiscal year 2024, the Supervisory Board did not make any changes 
to the applicable performance criteria."
"Target values and target 
attainment for the respective performance criteria will be disclosed ex-
ante (target setting Stock Awards – ESG) or ex-post (target setting 
Bonus, Stock Awards – EPS; all target attainment)."
"The compensation system for Executive Board members will be subject 
to approval by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in 2025, pursuant to 
Section 120a of the German Stock Corporation Act."
"During the course 
of fiscal year 2024, the Supervisory Board intends to assess the current 
compensation system and – if necessary – prepare adjustments."
"This 
process will be accompanied by intensive discussions with shareholder 
representatives, proxy advisors and other stakeholders."
"On November 15, 2023, Siemens Energy announced that the German 
government agreed to provide counter-guarantees for €7.5 billion in 
guarantees issued by a consortium of banks."
"Should the agreements 
with the German government and other parties have any impact on the 
compensation of the Executive Board, this will be disclosed trans-
parently in the compensation report for fiscal year 2024 as well as on 
the Company’s internet site."
"Variable compensation for fiscal years 2021-2023: 
Bonus payout amounts and notional value of unvested  
Siemens Energy Stock Awards tranches 
 
Representative example: Dr.-Ing."
"Supervisory Board compensation consists solely of fixed com-
pensation and reflects the level of responsibility and scope of activities 
required of members."
"The Chairman, Deputy Chairmen, as well as the 
Chair and Members of the Presiding Committee, Audit Committee, 
Sustainability and Finance Committee and Related Party Transactions 
Committee receive additional compensation."
"For participation in 
Supervisory Board meetings and committee meetings, each member 
receives €1,500 per meeting but no more than €3,000 per day in case 
more than one of such meetings is held on the same day."
"Members of the Special Committee Siemens Gamesa do not receive any 
compensation for membership in the committee but are paid 
attendance fees."
"Members of the Supervisory Board and (or) its com-
mittees who have held office for less than a full fiscal year receive their 
compensation on a pro-rata temporis basis."
"Members of the Supervisory 
Board are reimbursed for expenses incurred in the course of performing 
their duties, including any taxes applicable on those expenses."
"The 
Chair of the Supervisory Board is also provided an office with 
administrative support."
"2  
These employee representatives were appointed to the Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG by a resolution of the Munich District Court on August 2, 2022, effective from September 1, 2022."
"Their base compensation for fiscal 
year 2022 is determined on a pro-rata temporis basis, rounded up to the next full month (fiscal year 2022 = 1/12 months)."
"4.6.3 Other 
The Company provides a directors’ and officers’ liability group insurance 
policy for Supervisory and Executive Board members and certain other 
employees of the Siemens Energy Group."
"The policy is taken out for and 
renewed one year at a time."
"It covers the personal liability of the insured 
individuals in cases of financial loss associated with their activities on 
behalf the Company."
"With effect from their appointment as members 
of the Executive Board, these individuals are subject to a mandatory 
deductible that complies with the requirements of the German Stock 
Corporation Act."
"4.6.4 Comparative presentation 
In accordance with Section 162 para."
"2 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act, the following table shows the change in compensation 
for members of the Executive Board and members of the Supervisory 
Board in comparison to the workforce in Germany on a full-time 
equivalent basis."
"Further, change over time in the Company’s financial 
performance is reported on the basis of two performance criteria that 
are used for managing the Group."
"The comparative presentation is 
affected by exceptional effects in connection with the Spin-Off of 
Siemens Energy from the Siemens Group."
"None of the members of the 
Executive Board were in office for the entirety of fiscal year 2020, but 
rather Dr.-Ing."
"Christian Bruch, Maria Ferraro, Dr.-Ing."
"Jochen Eickholt 
and Tim Holt were appointed with effect from April 1, 2020 or 
May 1, 2020."
"The members of the Supervisory Board who received compensation for 
fiscal year 2020 were appointed with effect from September 25, 2020 
and thus received base compensation and compensation for work on 
board committees on a pro-rata temporis basis, rounded up to the next 
full month."
"In order to ensure comparability between fiscal years 2020 
and 2021 and with compensation paid to the workforce in Germany, 
the compensation awarded or due to the members of the Executive and 
Supervisory for fiscal year 2020 was extrapolated for the full year."
"Only 
two Supervisory Board committees were constituted in fiscal year 2020, 
the Presiding Committee and the Audit Committee."
"As a result, 
compensation for the members of the Sustainability and Finance 
Committee and the Related Party Transaction Committee – which were 
constituted on December 3, 2020 – increased in fiscal year 2021 solely 
due to their work on committees that had not yet been formed in fiscal 
year 2020."
"No adjustments were made to the Supervisory Board 
compensation laid out in Section 12 of the Company’s Articles of 
Association."

equity awards for employees of Siemens Energy and in accordance with the applicable plan rules for Siemens Stock Awards – settled in cash following the Spin-Off of Siemens Energy from the Siemens Group."
"A portion of the value 
of these cash settlements is attributable to the period in fiscal year 2020 during which the members of the Executive Board were in office: for Maria Ferraro this amounted to €151,087, for Dr.-Ing Jochen Eickholt €205,162 and for

"Christian Bruch, €251,668 for Maria Ferraro, €271,908 for Dr.-Ing."
"Jochen Eickholt and €230,000 for Tim Holt."
"If the cash settlements for Siemens Stock Awards and the cash payments in lieu of 
(additional) Siemens Stock Awards grants are included, compensation awarded or due in fiscal year 2020 – adjusted to a full-year basis – would amount to €5.2 million for Dr.-Ing."

"3 In fiscal year 2020, Dr.-Ing."
Christian Bruch was awarded a compensatory payment in the amount of €3.2 million for forfeited compensation claims with his previous employer.
"A corresponding adjustment was made to Dr.-
Ing."

"Manuel 
Bloemers and Thomas Pfann, who are employee representatives, were appointed to the Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG by a resolution of the Munich District Court on August 2, 2022, effective from September 1, 2022."
"Their base compensation for fiscal year 2022 is determined on a pro-rata temporis basis, rounded up to the next full month (fiscal year 2022 = 1/12 months)."
"The remaining employee representatives were appointed to the 
Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG effective November 10, 2020."
"5 The disclosed total workforce in Germany comprises employees (full time equivalent as of September 30 of the fiscal year) of Siemens Energy excluding Siemens Gamesa in Germany (fiscal year 2023: 21,921; fiscal 
year 2022: 21,882; fiscal year 2021: 22,424)."
"This figure excludes interns, working students, doctoral students and trainees."
"Compensation for the workforce is calculated based on personnel expenses recorded for fiscal year 2022, 
less expenses for the Executive Board’s compensation."
"If these programs were considered, the average compensation 
for the workforce in Germany for fiscal year 2021 would be €1,984 higher than disclosed above."
No such awards were granted in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 .
