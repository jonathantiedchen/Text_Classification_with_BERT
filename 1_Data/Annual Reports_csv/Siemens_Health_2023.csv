"Siemens Healthineers Strategy 2025 
Against the backdrop of the healthcare trends described in  A.1.2 Business environment."
"Siemens Healthineers has defined 
strategic priorities to ensure its competitiveness beyond 2025."
"As reported in the Annual Report 2022, we have successfully 
completed the first two phases, known as Reinforcing and Upgrading, respectively, as part of the Siemens Healthineers Strategy 
2025."
"The transformational business combination of Siemens Healthineers and Varian, for instance, enabled us to expand into 
adjacent markets."
"At the same time, we have expanded our core business and strengthened our role as a holistic partner for our 
customers."
"In fiscal year 2023, we completed the first half of the third phase, known as ""New Ambition""."
"During the second half 
of New Ambition phase, Siemens Healthineers’ seeks to achieve average annual comparable revenue growth of 6–8% and 
average annual growth in adjusted basic earnings per share of 12–15% for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, excluding contributions 
from rapid COVID-19 antigen tests."
"The outlook for fiscal year 2024 is presented in the chapter  A.5.2 Expected business 
development."
"As a global healthcare leader, our high-level focus in the New Ambition phase is to fight dangerous non-communicable diseases 
such as cancer, stroke, and heart attack worldwide, enable efficient workflows in hospitals, and improve access to modern 
medical care in low- or medium-income countries."
"The New Ambition phase focuses on five growth priorities or vectors (see 
below), and our segments and regions are executing the plans and programs they have developed for pursuing these priorities."
"In the Comprehensive Cancer Care vector, we want to expand our leading position in oncology by addressing additional 
customer segments along the entire disease pathway."
"To this end, we intend to enhance and strongly integrate our radiotherapy 
and imaging products, build a strong portfolio in interventional oncology, expand our multidisciplinary software solutions and 
technology-enabled services, and expand our cancer decision support for better therapy guidance."
"In the Cardiovascular and Neurovascular Care vector, we focus on coronary heart disease and stroke."
"The Networked Care & Digitally Enabled Services vector addresses the biggest operational challenges our customers are currently 
facing, such as staff shortages, rising labor costs, increasing demand, and rapid technological and scientific progress."
"The 
Networked Care sub-vector is dedicated to healthcare services provided at facilities other than a central hospital or laboratory, as 
part of a network."
"The ambition of the Digitally Enabled Services is to put healthcare providers in position to provide more 
patients with better care by enabling them to improve and automate manual workflows that have previously drained significant 
resources and given rise to inefficiencies."
"The China Healthcare growth vector concentrates on what is expected to be world’s largest national market in medical 
technology by the year 2030 and to make the greatest growth contribution in the med-tech sector worldwide."
"As part of its 14th 
Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Business principles 
 
07 
Five-Year Plan, China intends to adapt its own healthcare and medical technology sector to new economic and social 
developments."
"Our ambition is to strengthen our role as a trusted partner of the Chinese healthcare system and its patients by 
tackling the key societal challenges in healthcare in the fields of cancer therapy, digital healthcare, and diagnostics and through 
new local business models."
"To further enhance our ability to achieve the goals of New Ambition and to reflect the strategic 
priority placed on healthcare in China, a new “China” region was implemented at the start of fiscal year 2023."
"In the Access to Care vector, we will be focusing on the approximately about four billion people worldwide who still do not have 
access to adequate healthcare today."
"The main obstacles here are a lack of infrastructure, affordability of treatment, and a lack of 
health awareness."
"As non-communicable diseases become more prevalent in the coming years, affordable healthcare will need 
to cover a broader base than before."
"We have already initiated steps toward this end, including in the areas of digitalization, 
financing, partnerships, and training of medical personnel, which will enable us to implement our strategy in the coming years."
"In alignment with the Siemens Healthineers Strategy 2025, we aim to enhance healthcare products, services, and solutions for 
the benefit of patients, medical professionals, and society as a whole."
"Thereby, Siemens Healthineers embraces a responsibility 
not only to advance healthcare delivery and accessibility, but also to promote environmental stewardship and embrace diversity 
and employee engagement to improve well-being in the workplace as well as in the surrounding communities."
"Our dedication to 
sustainability revolves around three main pillars, reinforcing our positive social impact and setting high benchmarks for our 
environmental aspirations."
"To emphasize our 
commitment and show how closely we tie sustainability to our strategy, sustainability is now also embedded in our purpose: We 
pioneer breakthroughs in healthcare."
"The enhancement of our purpose shows that we 
take our responsibility as a global company seriously and that we will deeply integrate sustainability into our business processes 
throughout the entire value chain."
"Research and development 
Our research and development (“R&D”) activities are of crucial importance for the development of our products and healthcare 
portfolio."
"They should enable us to offer our customers innovative and sustainable solutions for diagnostics and therapy, while 
also ensuring and enhancing our competitiveness as a company."
"Artificial intelligence (“AI”), sensors, and robotics are focal points of our R&D activities."
"AI has been an integral part of key 
innovations developed by Siemens Healthineers for several years."
"In our portfolio of products and solutions, we employ AI 
successfully for data analysis and interpretation, decision-making, intelligent robot control, and automation."
"We are strongly 
motivated by the vision of the “digital twin,” which holds the promise of great opportunities for new healthcare solutions."
"In the Imaging segment, we use AI in our latest magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) scanners for clinical and scientific 
applications: the Magnetom Cima.X with a magnetic field strength of 3 tesla and the Magnetom Terra.X with a field strength of 7 
tesla."
"And now, for the first time, these high-end scanners are making amongst others use of our AI-based image reconstruction 
technology known as Deep Resolve."
"Deep Resolve can bring about a significant reduction of scan times with improved image 
quality."
"For example, AI algorithms can reduce scan times by up to 70 percent while also doubling the image resolution."
"The 
shorter scan time should allow a significant improvement in patient comfort."
"Thanks to their high field strengths and powerful 
gradient performance, both the Magnetom Cima.X and the Magnetom Terra.X are suited for imaging the finest structures within 
the body with greater clarity."
"Because of the strong gradients render microstructures are much more visible, allowing for earlier 
therapeutic treatment and thus improvement in the patient’s outlook."
"Furthermore, both scanners feature assistance systems 
that support the preparation and execution of scans, making it easier to operate the scanners."
"This should minimize training 
costs and makes it possible to seamlessly integrate new scanners into a customer’s existing fleet."
A growing share of our R&D activities is devoted to improving the sustainability of our products.
"Turning off MRT systems overnight for 12 hours lowers energy consumption by 25%-33% and 
the activation of an additional energy-saving mode, a new energy function in the newer MRT scanners of Siemens Healthineers, 
lowers the energy consumption of the turned-off scanners by another 22-28%."
"These results, which have been outlined in a new 
study, can help the healthcare sector, which accounts for 4.4% of worldwide CO2 emissions, reduce its CO2 footprint."
"We also 
support our customers by developing and providing regular system updates and upgrades throughout the product lifecycle."
"By 
lengthening the lifecycle in this way and maintaining our installed base of refurbished systems, we contribute to the goals of the 
circular economy and enhance sustainability in the healthcare sector."
"In the field of computed tomography, we have also introduced new and innovative features for the established dual-source 
family SOMATOM Drive and SOMATOM Force."
"For example, the new “FAST Bolus” function allows for an automated and dynamic 
scan trigger delay, which can be adapted to suit individual patients, leading to improved image quality when contrast media are 
administered, depending on the individual patient’s constitution."
"The two systems also 
feature innovations in the areas of platform design, display technologies, and improved ergonomics and workflows."
"In the area of mammography, Siemens Healthineers has introduced the Mammomat B.brilliant, a newly developed 
mammography system utilizing wide-angle tomosynthesis."
"In this device, the x-ray tube rotates around the breast in a 50° angle."
"Coupled with a scan time of around five seconds, this feature makes it the world’s fastest wide-angle tomosynthesis system, 
generating a 3-D image with very high depth resolution in the shortest time."
"The latest addition to our laboratory diagnostics portfolio in the Diagnostics segment is the Atellica CI Analyzer, a compact 
analysis system for laboratories."
"The Atellica CI Analyzer enables both independent laboratories and the satellite laboratories of 
larger healthcare networks to work with the same reagents, consumable supplies, and smart software as for the flagship Atellica 
Solution, but condensed into a 1.9 square meter footprint."
"Cardiac radioablation 
treatments are being planned and conducted on the basis of the CRA system of Siemens Healthineers."
"The cardiac radioablation 
treatment planning and delivery process requires close collaboration between electrophysiologists, who specialize in treating 
cardiac arrhythmias, and radiation oncologists, who specialize in treating cancer and other conditions with radiation therapy."
"The 
CRA system of Siemens Healthineers, which was designated a “breakthrough device” by the U.S."
"Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), is a non-invasive, end-to-end solution designed to facilitate interdisciplinary clinical collaboration."
"In the Advanced Therapies segment, Siemens Healthineers has introduced the ARTIS icono ceiling system for cardiological 
applications."
"This ceiling-mounted angiography system with specially developed features for cardiological and cardiovascular 
care offers innovative functions to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, coronary heart diseases, and 
structural heart diseases."
"The goal of this system is to optimize clinical workflows while also ensuring excellent image quality 
with minimal radiation exposure."
"Moreover, early diagnosis and precise treatment decisions are critical to the ability to deliver 
the most targeted interventions possible."
"Furthermore, the systems of Siemens Healthineers regularly receive extensive software releases to improve user friendliness and 
add innovative applications."
"In fiscal year 2023, for example, the software application syngo DynaCT Bone Removal was 
developed and released for the ARTIS icono and ARTIS pheno systems."
"This application is an AI-supported solution that 
automatically detects and eliminates bone structures in order to improve the depiction of blood vessels during the procedure."
"It 
supports interventional radiologists in a large number of procedures, particularly in areas with considerable bone substance (rib 
cage, hip area), saving time compared to the formerly manual image processing and also optimizing workflow."
"Siemens Healthineers also opened its new Innovation Center at the Erlangen site, in the heart of Germany’s “Medical Valley” 
medical technology research cluster."
"A chief feature of the center’s approach is open innovation, meaning collaboration with 
outside partner enterprises, start-ups, and academic and clinical facilities to improve the quality of healthcare worldwide."
"The 
network of innovation centers is part of an established ecosystem of centers in Shanghai, China, and Bengaluru, India."
"In addition to expanding our portfolio, our R&D teams strive for continuous improvement of existing products and solutions."
"Our 
R&D workforce already exceeds 13,000 employees at fiscal yearend 2023 and operates at a number of R&D sites around the 
world, mainly in Germany, the U.S., China, and India."
"The distribution of our R&D workforce across an international network of 
sites enables us to meet the needs of local markets and gives us access to local job markets, allowing us to hire the best 
employee for the respective job."
We supplement our internal capabilities through our relationships with strategic partners.
"In fiscal year 2023, we reported R&D expenses of €1,866 million (2022: €1,785 million)."
"The resulting R&D intensity, defined as 
the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, was 9% (2022: 8%)."
"Additions to capitalized development expenses amounted to €244 
million (2022: €212 million)."
"Therefore, the ratio of capitalized development expenses to total R&D expenses was 13% (2022: 
12%)."
The scheduled amortization of capitalized development expenses totaled €94 million (2022: €123 million).
"As of September 30, 2023, we had about 24,000 technical intellectual property rights."
"This figure includes about 15,000 granted 
patents, slightly above the level of fiscal year 2022."

A.1.2 Business environment 
We operate in growth markets characterized by long-term stability, which are supported by the major trends described below."
"Within the market’s long term development, there may also be short term fluctuations arising from macroeconomic and health 
political developments, such as changes in health policy, regulation or reimbursement systems."
"Because a substantial portion of 
Siemens Healthineers’ revenue stems from recurring business, we pursue our growth opportunities from a stable foundation of 
profit."
"Healthcare market trends 
Healthcare markets worldwide are influenced by four sustained major, lasting trends."
"These trends remain unchanged, with little 
effect from short-term developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, and recent geopolitical events."
"Nevertheless, 
such developments have strengthened some of these trends while also presenting new opportunities and challenges in the last 
few years."
"The first trend is demographic developments, especially the world’s growing and aging population."
"This trend poses major 
challenges for global healthcare systems, in both developed and in emerging and developing economies."
"In many economies, 
combating COVID-19 increased healthcare costs unexpectedly, and the resulting debt created additional cost pressure and 
limited the flexibility to make new investments."
"However, these challenges also present an opportunity for healthcare providers 
by increasing the demand for cost-efficient healthcare solutions."
"The second trend is economic development in emerging 
countries, which is improving access to healthcare for many people."
"Nonetheless, about four out of eight billion people still do 
not have adequate access to medical care."
"The extent of this problem was made clear by the pandemic, which disproportionately 
affected vulnerable population groups."
"Significant investments will persist, driving overall demand for healthcare products and 
services and hence market growth."
"The third trend is the increase in non-communicable diseases as a consequence of an aging 
population in combination with, environmental and lifestyle-related changes."
"This trend results in far more patients with multiple 
morbidities, increasing the need for new ways to detect and treat diseases in a timely manner."
"The fourth global trend with a 
significant impact on our business development is the transformation of healthcare providers such as hospitals and laboratories."
A combination of societal and market forces is driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently.
"The pandemic only increased the pressure to which healthcare providers were 
already exposed particularly by exacerbating the shortage of skilled workers and boosting labor costs."
"Digitally supported 
solutions, among other forms of technology, are being employed as a means of coping with staff shortages resulting from 
significantly higher workloads."
"Digitalization, automation of workflows, and artificial intelligence (AI) continue to play a crucial 
role in the quest to optimize a holistic patient experience, improve treatment outcomes, and reduce overall treatment costs."
"The 
COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of these issues and accelerated their ascendance as key factors for healthcare 
providers."
"For example, telemedicine proved to be invaluable as a means of maintaining social distancing as patients increasingly 
used such services as an alternative to in-person doctor visits."
"The growing cost pressure will continue to drive new remuneration 
models for healthcare services such as value-based reimbursement instead of treatment-based reimbursement."
"The pandemic 
and the associated increase in healthcare costs, as well as the changed economic environment caused by inflation and rising 
interest rates, further bolstered the trend of consolidation of healthcare providers into networks to address these factors."
"The 
goal of these larger hospital and laboratory chains, which often operate internationally, and increasingly also in the manner of 
large corporations, is to systematically lowering costs while improving the quality of medical care."
"This development has 
increased the demand for standardized and scalable systems and solutions, as well as new business models such as Managed 
Equipment Services (MES) as a customer-specific solution to manage all the medical equipment in a hospital."
"Developments in health policy 
Driven by the need in many countries to deliver better treatment outcomes at lower costs, regulators are increasingly seeking to 
change their reimbursement models to place greater emphasis on the quality of healthcare."
"Consequently, the reimbursement 
paid for healthcare services is increasingly geared to treatment outcomes rather than quantity of services alone."
"To this end, pilot 
projects involving value-based healthcare are already being implemented in most industrialized nations."
"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak impacted regulatory environments and practices, presenting governments and healthcare 
providers with unprecedented challenges."
"Regulatory authorities have utilized targeted methods to bring diagnostic products to 
market faster."
"These include changes to existing reimbursement structures, emergency approvals, and accelerated regulatory 
processes for some products such as rapid COVID-19 PCR tests and antigen tests."
"Now that the health emergency caused by 
COVID-19 has ended, these methods have been set aside in the United States, the EMEA, and China."
"In response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, governments have also created and kept in place legal frameworks conducive to the deployment of telehealth 
technology and reimbursement for digital solutions such as telehealth services in countries including China, the United States, 
and Germany."
"Thus, the pandemic underscored and increased the importance and value of such technologies."
"Electronic medical 
records for patients, coupled with the possibility of remote medical treatment, are already of great importance, particularly at 
hospitals in China, for example."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Business principles

In the coming years, three of our most important markets – the United States, China, and Europe – will face additional 
uncertainties when it comes to health policy and financing."
"Lawmakers in the United States continue to debate legislative 
changes to the healthcare system with the primary goals of increasing price transparency and lowering costs for patients, which 
have bipartisan support."
Congress had not enacted any cuts to hospital reimbursement during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"It is now considering proposals to equalize the reimbursements paid to hospital outpatient departments and freestanding 
medical centers."
"In its 14th Five-Year Plan covering the years 2021 to 2025, China set the following priorities for its healthcare sector: innovation, 
industrial modernization, digitalization, and a “healthy China”."
"China’s tiered hospital system is one of the key points of focus of 
that country’s healthcare reform."
"To even out social and geographic disparities in the provision of health services, the country 
continues to build out and modernize primary care while expanding higher-quality medical centers."
"China intends to continue to 
ramp up its “dual-circulation” economic model with the aim of reducing external dependencies and expanding domestic 
consumption."
"On the one hand, China has said it wants to continue opening its markets in order to spur growth and make 
progress with globalization and integrative development."
"On the other hand, the government’s support for the modernization of 
local manufacturing and an enhanced policy of local preferment should increase competition between multinationals and local 
providers."
Reform of the healthcare system is intended to be further stepped up in order to improve quality and efficiency.
"To 
achieve a lower price through a larger purchasing volume and thus lower healthcare costs, the centralized volume-based public 
procurement system is being expanded both geographically and with regard to specific products in the in-vitro and in-vivo 
segments."
"Reform of the reimbursement system, flat-rate-per-case billing (known as Diagnosis-Related Groups or DRGs), and a 
new health insurance reimbursement method (known as Diagnosis Intervention Packet or DIP) should cover inpatient services in 
all relevant hospitals by the end of 2025."
"In addition, the procurement of new medical equipment by hospitals has been 
simplified by expanding the range of medical equipment that does not require government approval."
"This step should create 
growth potential in the coming years."
"In Europe, the European Commission has responded forcefully to the COVID-19 pandemic via its Recovery and Resilience Facility 
(RRF), providing member states with significant funds to strengthen the resilience of their healthcare systems."
"We can already 
observe that these funds are having a positive effect on our markets."
"The company’s operating environment could be affected in 
the medium term by an increasingly complex regulatory framework at the European level, as new laws on the subject of 
digitalization and sustainability are being regulated."
"The European Parliament and Council have reached an agreement on 
regulations to promote a fair and innovative data economy as part of a new Data Act requiring medical technology companies to 
share information with third parties."
"We expect that the Data Act will have both negative and positive impacts on medical 
technology provider and market growth."
"Now that healthcare policy initiatives in Germany are no longer focused on COVID-19, 
we see an increased interest in policy reforms aimed at the digitalization of healthcare."
"We also see a shift towards more 
outpatient care and increased specialization in inpatient care as a result of the stabilization of COVID-19 infection rates."
"The 
German Federal Health Ministry has initiated multiple legislative processes: reform of the reimbursement and planning structure 
of inpatient hospital care in Germany, a new regulation on the use of health data and a new law to accelerate the pace of 
digitalization in the healthcare system."
The latter two bills could give rise to market opportunities.
"At the same time, the 
continuing war in Ukraine and its consequences for the national economies – including inflation such as higher energy and raw-
material prices – are putting additional pressure on publicly funded healthcare systems throughout Europe."
"Trade 
barriers are becoming more widespread, affecting all our segments’ markets and placing additional financial burdens on 
companies."
"The trade conflict between the United States and China continues to hamper the flow of goods between these 
countries and across the global economy."
"This trade policy dispute has led to the introduction of new tariffs and higher rates of 
existing tariffs, as well as export restrictions."
"These measures could especially affect trade in critical economic sectors, key 
technologies such as AI technology, 5G mobile networks, and other high-tech segments."
"Ongoing differences between the two 
nations will continue to pose challenges for trade."
"The war in Ukraine has accelerated the fragmentation of the global 
geopolitical landscape and widened the divide between the Western world and China."
"Confronted with these tensions, Western 
companies may opt to pursue a strategy of risk prevention, which could lead to a reduction of dependency on China as a means 
of mitigating the risk of adverse effects on production and technology."
"They could shift their operations to nearby countries or 
even to their home countries to enhance the resilience of their production processes, supply chains, and logistics."
"It may also be 
necessary to diversify the supplier base and maintain higher stocks of critical components to increase supply security."
"They could 
also reduce their trading ties with China by trading with other countries instead."
"Besides geopolitical events, macroeconomic 
developments are also impacting the business environment and creating uncertainties throughout the world."
"The war in Ukraine 
and the resulting sanctions against Russia have created energy shortages and driven energy prices higher."
"Since then, however, 
prices have begun to fall in the energy markets."
"However, the resurgence of conflict in the Gaza Strip threatens to worsen the 
situation on the energy markets once again."
"In the face of stubbornly higher inflation across the world, central banks have 
continued to raise their benchmark lending rates."
"The resulting increase in borrowing costs has exerted strong pressure on the 
economic output of industrialized nations."
"Both medical equipment manufacturers and their customers are facing higher costs, 
Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Business principles 
 
11 
also as a result of increased shipping and logistical expenses."
"However, the supply chain logjams caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic have already begun to ease now that the pandemic has ended and corresponding downstream effects have subsided."
"Segment markets  
The following fundamental trends can be observed in the Imaging market: personalized precision medicine and increased 
utilization of imaging devices in screening, non-invasive therapy, and invasive intervention."
"These trends are driving broader 
application of imaging procedures and digitalization and therefore increasing demand for imaging technology."
"Moreover, 
developments in AI, big data, and machine learning continue to shape the future of population health management."
"Intelligent 
imaging (“smart imaging value chain”) will remain critical to care management and delivery, productivity growth, and value 
creation."
"A moderate level of consolidation is one of the key characteristics of the global imaging market, in which 
Siemens Healthineers, GE HealthCare, and Philips Healthcare are the top three players."
"The burgeoning population in developing countries and the constantly rising demand for diagnostic tests are spurring growth of 
the Diagnostics market."
"A major influence on the growth of the Diagnostics market is, for example, the introduction of 
centralized, volume-based public procurement in China, which has intensified price pressure in the market."
"As in prior years, 
healthcare providers continue to consolidate their operations to cut laboratory costs while also industrializing their testing 
processes in order to improve efficiency through automation and digitalization."
"Increased digitalization will further enhance 
laboratory productivity and enable better integration of diagnostic test results into clinical decision-making."
"Immunochemistry is 
one the largest and fastest growing segments of the Diagnostics market."
"Whether in acute or non-acute situations, point-of-care 
tests offer advantages that have gained in significance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Such tests can deliver reliable 
results in just a few minutes, which can improve patient care."
"Diagnostics is a fragmented market, with a variety of global, 
regional, and specialized providers competing with each other across market segments."
"Together with Roche Diagnostics and 
Abbott Laboratories, Siemens Healthineers is a major player in this market."
There are numerous growth factors in the market of the Varian’s segment.
New cancer incidences are projected to rise from about 19 million (in 2020) to 30 million annually by 2040.
"Faster growth of new incidences in low- and middle-income countries, which lack adequate infrastructure and human capital to 
address this growing cancer burden, is accelerating demand for cost-effective, high-quality cancer care modalities."
"The radiotherapy and radiosurgery markets 
are highly consolidated."
"They are mainly served by Siemens Healthineers, Elekta AB, and Accuray Inc."
One of the main factors driving growth in the market for Advanced Therapies is advancing innovation in clinical procedures.
"Minimally invasive procedures as well as the growing complexity of procedures that require sophisticated technological devices 
and advanced imaging are key market drivers."
"In particular, technological innovations in imaging, robotics, medical devices and 
IT result in minimally invasive procedures with lower risks of complications, faster recovery times, less post-operative pain, 
shorter hospital stays, and lower costs."
"The global Advanced Therapies market can be described as consolidated, with three top 
players: Siemens Healthineers, Philips Healthcare and GE HealthCare."
"It shows the development of adjusted revenue, net of currency translation effects, which are beyond 
our control, and portfolio effects, which involve business activities that are either new to our business or no longer a part of it."
"Currency translation effects are the difference between adjusted revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange 
rates of the current period and adjusted revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison 
period."
"For calculating the percentage change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by adjusted revenue for the 
comparison period."
"A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition or a disposition and is calculated as the change year-
over-year in adjusted revenue related to the transaction."
"For calculating the percentage change, this absolute change is divided 
by adjusted revenue for the comparison period."
"Any portfolio effect is excluded for the 12 months following the relevant 
transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change."
"For Siemens Healthineers, revenue is defined as consolidated revenue reported in the company’s consolidated statements of 
income."
"Adjusted revenue, which is key to calculating comparable revenue growth, is adjusted for effects in line with the 
revaluation of contract liabilities from IFRS 3 purchase price allocations."
"Adjusted basic earnings per share 
Performance of Siemens Healthineers is measured using adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS)."
"The adjustments (including revenue) relate to income and expenses that do not reflect operating performance and therefore 
adversely affect the comparability of financial results between periods."
"For this reason, other restructuring expenses will also be 
adjusted as of fiscal year 2024."
The adjustments are made after tax.
"Accordingly, this includes the adjustment of material valuation effects on deferred taxes, 
which arise from changes in tax law and are associated with the above adjustment items."
Tax effects on the adjustments are determined based on the income tax rate for the reporting period.
"Determination of adjusted 
basic EPS is based on the average weighted number of outstanding shares in the reporting period."
"Additional performance indicators 
The most significant financial key performance indicators are supplemented by additional performance indicators, which are 
used in particular to manage the operating segments."
"Because they directly influence the most significant financial key 
performance indicators, the additional performance indicators are included as assumptions for the assessment of the expected 
development."
"Comparable revenue growth 
We also use comparable revenue growth as a performance indicator to manage and monitor the growth of the segments."
"It 
shows the development of total adjusted revenue."
"At the segment level, revenue is defined as total revenue and corresponds to 
the sum of external and intersegment revenue."
"Total adjusted revenue of the segments, which is key to calculating comparable 
revenue growth, is adjusted for effects in line with the revaluation of contract liabilities from IFRS 3 purchase price allocations."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Financial performance system

Adjusted EBIT margin 
We use adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin for managing the operating performance."
"Adjusted EBIT is 
defined as income before income taxes, interest income and expenses, and other financial income, net, adjusted for non-
operating items."
"The adjustments (including revenue) relate to income and expenses that do not reflect operating performance and therefore 
adversely affect the comparability of financial results between periods."
"For this reason, other restructuring expenses will also be 
adjusted as of fiscal year 2024."
Adjusted EBIT margin is defined as the adjusted EBIT of the particular segment divided by its adjusted total revenue.
"Dividend 
We aim to provide an attractive return to our shareholders."
"Therefore, we intend to pay an annual dividend in the amount of 50% 
to 60% of the net income of the respective prior fiscal year."
"To this end, net income – the calculation basis for the dividend – may 
be adjusted for selected exceptional non-cash items."
"The global addressable market for the Imaging segment (equipment sales and 
product-related services) grew to approximately € 34 billion in fiscal year 2023."
"The size of the worldwide market for the 
Diagnostics segment (including reagents, consumables, and product-related services, but excluding point-of-care antigen rapid 
tests and molecular diagnostics) was approximately € 36 billion."
"The size of the global addressable market for the Varian 
segment (linear accelerators, software solutions and services, radiotherapy imaging, and product-related services) was 
approximately € 6 billion in fiscal year 2023."
Services account for the majority of recurring revenues in Varian’s markets.
"The 
addressable market for Advanced Therapies (angiography systems, mobile C-arms, and product-related services) was slightly less 
than € 7 billion."
"Global economic growth weakened on a broad basis in fiscal year 2023, especially in the European Union."
"However, the 
healthcare sector is more independent from the normal business cycle than other sectors and therefore more resilient against 
cyclical fluctuations."
"Nonetheless, the uncertainty associated with macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges has been 
persistent."
"Economic activity has been weighed down by hikes in the key interest rates by central banks to combat high inflation 
resulting in increased borrowing costs."
The ongoing war in Ukraine has caused further economic uncertainties.
"Although supply 
chains have now largely recovered, they were still impacted in the first half of fiscal year 2023."
"Competition between the leading 
medical technology companies remained at high levels."
"While long-term market tends  A.1.2 Business environment generally remained intact, the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation 
reinforced some of these trends by raising, for example, the already intense cost pressure on healthcare systems and customers 
to unprecedented levels."
"The already serious shortage of medical personnel worsened, leading to considerable delays in the 
delivery of care at many hospitals, which temporarily overwhelmed healthcare systems."
"The trend of consolidation among 
hospitals continued as a result of increasing healthcare costs, aimed at improving the quality of care for patients and countering 
the shortage of skilled personnel."
"Among the positive consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic were heightened demand for 
cost-efficient healthcare solutions, increased innovation, and an accelerated paced adoption of digital technology."
The Imaging segment’s market generally experienced strong growth in fiscal year 2023.
"Stabilization of supply chains gradually 
reduced lead times for equipment delivery and installation, making it possible to fill orders to the accustomed extent again."
"Higher revenues were generated on sales of both equipment and product-related services thanks to the high level of order 
backlogs in the market resulting from demand catch-up effects, on the one hand, and increased investment in diagnostic 
imaging equipment in reaction to announced price hikes."
"Another factor contributing to revenue growth in Europe was 
increased government spending in countries such as Spain and Italy to kick-start the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic and 
bolster the resilience of healthcare systems."
"Excluding rapid COVID-19 tests and molecular diagnostics, the market for the Diagnostics segment experienced moderate 
growth overall in fiscal year 2023."
"Demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests declined sharply after the COVID-19 pandemic 
ceased to be a global health emergency and the incidence of COVID-19 infections subsided."
"Higher demand for such tests is not 
expected in the absence of serious flare-ups."
"Laboratory diagnostics includes routine, specialty, and critical care tests performed 
primarily in hospital and laboratory settings, while point-of-care applications bring testing to patients in primary and urgent care 
locations."
"Supply chain disruptions were still evident at the start of fiscal year 2023, delaying the delivery of products and 
associated revenue generation."
"Furthermore, the overall demand for routine tests continued to normalize as the pandemic 
subsided."
The global market for the Varian segment experienced very strong growth.
"Overall market growth, especially in the United States 
and Western Europe, was boosted by the introduction of new innovations, which led to increased investments by customers, 
replacement of ageing equipment, and growing sales of services."
"Continued improvements in access to radiotherapy for 
underserved population groups and regions, especially in the Asia-Pacific region and in low- to medium-income countries, 
boosted demand in these regions."
"The macroeconomic recovery and stabilization of supply chains, have further supported the 
recovery of the market."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023

The overall market for the Advanced Therapies segment experienced strong growth, due in part to pent-up demand from the 
prior year and the associated work-off of high order backlogs."
"Available budgets at levels similar before the COVID-19 pandemic had the effect of increasing investments in image-based 
applications, especially in surgery and cardiology."
"Moreover, technological innovations and advances in the field of artificial 
intelligence expanded the range of clinical applications and the performance of increasingly complex minimally invasive 
procedures."
"Effective October 1, 2022, the company’s regional structure was modified to include four regions (instead of the previous three): 
“Europe, CIS, Africa, Middle East (EMEA)”, “Americas”, “Asia, Pacific, Japan” and “China”."
The revenues generated in the Imaging segment’s market were sharply higher in the EMEA region.
"Whereas the region’s revenue 
performance was positively influenced by continuing EU investment programs, the war in Ukraine continued to exert a negative 
influence."
"The market for the Diagnostics segment generated modest growth in the EMEA region in fiscal year 2023 (excluding 
antigen rapid tests and molecular diagnostics)."
"Growth-inhibiting factors included the further consolidation of healthcare 
providers, persistently high price pressure, adverse developments in reimbursement structures, and strict regulations imposing 
specific safety and performance requirements before products can placed on the market."
"Varian’s market experienced very 
strong growth."
National investment programs in Spain and Italy fostered the growth.
"Even though growth in the global 
economy, especially in the European Union, weakened on a broad basis, the market benefited from the positive development in 
production, among other things."
"The Advanced Therapies market experienced very strong growth in the EMEA region, thanks in 
part to national investment programs in some countries such as Spain."
"The healthcare market in the United States, the largest market in the Americas region, had to contend with challenges such as 
heightened inflation and worsening shortages of clinical staff in fiscal year 2023."
"The overall Imaging market experienced very 
strong growth both in the Americas region and in the United States."
"High order backlogs resulting from pent-up demand from 
the prior fiscal year led to higher revenues from sales of both equipment and product-related services."
"In the market for the 
Diagnostics segment, the slight growth observed in the prior year continued in fiscal year 2023."
"Weakening demand for 
coagulation tests, which had been used to a greater extent in connection with COVID-19, weighed on growth in the field of 
hematology."
"The markets for the Varian segment experienced significant growth on the strength of rising investments in product 
and service innovations and the adoption of advanced techniques including stereotactic treatments and adaptive radiotherapy, 
which accelerated the pace of replacement purchases."
"Market growth was also supported by progress made in closing the 
radiotherapy access gap in Latin America."
"This trend is mainly driven by improved 
reimbursement rates for outpatient interventions."
"Although Japan is the largest market in the Asia, Pacific, Japan region, it is also a saturated market with little potential for 
growth, due in part to the general decrease in the number of hospitals and diminishing support from government programs after 
the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Growth in this region is driven by the developed countries Australia and Korea and by 
several developing countries such as India, Indonesia, and Thailand."
"In these countries, positive economic development and the 
growth of a prosperous middle class, which has also expanded the private healthcare market, are the main regional growth 
drivers."
"In some countries including India, for example, changing lifestyles have led to an increase in non-communicable diseases 
(e.g., cancer and cardiovascular diseases)."
"Many governments in this region are pursuing special government programs to 
counteract this trend and above all reduce the economic burden of the growing incidence of such diseases."
"In the Imaging 
segment, the overall market of the Asia, Pacific, Japan region experienced a slight contraction in fiscal year 2023."
"While markets 
recovered in fiscal year 2022, supporting revenue growth in fiscal year 2023, this was largely offset by a decrease in the growth 
of product-related services because growth in product-related services typically occurs with a time lag relative to growth in 
product and system sales."
The market for the Varian segment in the region expanded slightly after recovering.
"Market growth in 
this region is being driven by continuous improvement in access to radiotherapy."
"Another factor supporting growth is the stable 
market for equipment replacement purchases and the growing direct service presence of equipment manufacturers."
"The market 
for the Diagnostics segment in this region expanded slightly, as growth in developing countries such as India offset slight market 
contraction in Japan."
"Market growth in India was crimped by the increasing consolidation of laboratories and as associated 
adverse impact on market prices."
"The market for the Advanced Therapies segment in the Asia, Pacific, Japan region experienced 
moderate growth, thanks in part to sharp growth in India and Korea."

At the beginning of the fiscal year, the China region was still adversely impacted by strict lockdown restrictions and related 
effects on trade, and industry."
"The strict lockdown restrictions associated with from the zero-COVID strategy were lifted in 
January 2023."
"The market for the Diagnostics segment (excluding 
molecular diagnostics and antigen rapid tests) experienced moderate growth in fiscal year 2023."
"The volume of tests used in 
routine examinations returned to normal levels after the strict COVID-19 measures were lifted."
"In addition, the amount of point-
of-care laboratory tests in outpatient care for blood gas measurements and cardiological diagnostics increased."
"The continued 
implementation of volume-based procurement, the government’s price control policy, and rising import restrictions continued to 
have an adverse effect on pricing and market access both in the laboratory market and the point-of-care market."
"The market for 
the Varian segment remained flat as market growth was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related restictions 
in the first half of fiscal year 2023 and the related restrictions."
"The credit incentive program under the economic stimulus 
package in China had a positive effect on investment by healthcare providers, leading to strong equipment sales in the market 
for the Advanced Therapies segment."
"However, the market for product-related services grew at a weaker rate in fiscal year 2023 
than in the prior year."
"The net effect of these developments was moderate growth in the market for the Advanced Therapies 
segment in China."
"All statements on market 
development refer to the actual data for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2023 because market data for the full fiscal year 
was not available as of the publication of the annual report."
"Market development in the fourth quarter is therefore included as a 
forecast."
The market data is based on sales of products and product-related services.

Siemens Healthineers 
On a comparable basis, revenue increased by 1.2% compared to the very good prior-year figure."
This revenue growth was supported by positive effects from price increases.
"In nominal terms, revenue 
amounted to €21,680 million and was on a par with the previous year‘s."
"Currency translation effects exerted a negative effect of 
approximately 2 percentage points on revenue growth."
"The 1.15 equipment book-to-bill ratio1 in fiscal year 2023 was excellent, 
but lower than the outstanding prior-year ratio of 1.23."
"Segments 
On a comparable basis, the adjusted revenue of the Imaging segment increased by 10.9%."
"Molecular Imaging generated a sharp 
growth, Magnetic Resonance significant growth."
"From a geographical perspective, the EMEA and Asia Pacific Japan regions 
generated significant revenue growth on a comparable basis, while the China and Americas regions generated very strong 
comparable revenue growth."
"In nominal terms, adjusted revenue rose by 9.0% to €11,842 million."
"On a comparable basis, the adjusted revenue of the Diagnostics segment declined by 24.2%."
"The EMEA, Americas, and Asia 
Pacific Japan regions registered a clear decline in revenue due to the rapid COVID-19 antigen test business, which ended in the 
fourth quarter."
"Excluding rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, revenue decreased by 1.2% on a comparable basis."
"The developments 
contributing to this result included a very strong decline in revenue in the China region due to lockdowns and increased COVID-
19 infection rates at the beginning of the fiscal year, which is why fewer routine tests were performed."
"In addition, the volume of 
tests for routine examinations in the China region recovered more slowly than in the prior year after COVID-19 restrictions were 
eased."
"In nominal terms, adjusted revenue declined by 25.3% to €4,528 million."
"This figure includes revenue of €121 million 
from sales of rapid COVID-19 antigen tests (prior year: almost €1,550 million)."
Varian’s adjusted revenue increased by 14.8% on a comparable basis.
"While the Americas and EMEA regions generated sharp 
comparable revenue growth, the China region generated significant growth and the Asia Pacific Japan region very strong growth 
compared with the prior year."
"In nominal terms, the segment generated revenue of €3,561 million, and thus recorded a growth 
of 13.8%."
The adjusted revenue of Advanced Therapies increased by 7.8% on comparable basis.
"From a geographical perspective, the China 
region generated sharp comparable revenue growth, the EMEA region very strong, the Asia Pacific Japan region strong, and the 
Americas region slight comparable revenue growth."
"In nominal terms, adjusted revenue rose by 5.2% to €2,019 million."
"Regions 
In the EMEA region, revenue declined by 0.2% on a comparable basis."
"This decline was due to the business with rapid COVID-19 
antigen tests, which ended and which resulted in clearly lower adjusted revenue compared to the prior year in the Diagnostics 
segment."
"By contrast, Varian generated sharp comparable revenue growth, Imaging significant comparable revenue growth, and 
Advanced Therapies very strong comparable revenue growth."
"On a comparable basis, Germany sustained a 26.1% revenue decline compared to the prior year."
"This result was also affected by 
the business with rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, which ended in the fourth quarter in the Diagnostics segment."
"Varian’s 
comparable revenue growth was moderate, that of Advanced Therapies slightly negative."
Imaging generated moderate growth.
"The 0.6% decline in comparable revenue in the Americas region was likewise due to clearly lower revenue in the Diagnostics 
segment, particularly due to the business with rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, which ended in the fourth quarter."
"In this region, 
Varian generated sharp comparable revenue growth, Imaging very strong, and Advanced Therapies slight comparable revenue 
growth."
"In the United States, revenue declined by 2.5% on a comparable basis."
"This development was influenced by the clear decline in 
revenue at Diagnostics due to the business with rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, which ended in the fourth quarter."
"By contrast, 
Varian generated sharp comparable revenue growth, Imaging strong, and Advanced Therapies slight comparable revenue 
growth."
"In the Asia Pacific Japan region, revenue increased by 4.7% on a comparable basis, particularly thanks to significant comparable 
revenue growth in the Imaging segment."
"Varian and Advanced Therapies also generated very strong and strong growth, 
respectively, over the respective prior-year figures."
"A countervailing development was the clear revenue decline in the 
Diagnostics segment due to the business with rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, which ended in the fourth quarter."
"1 Equipment-book-to-bill-ratio is defined as the ratio between equipment orders and equipment revenue, where equipment refers to all businesses except Diagnostics and product-based services."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023

On a comparable basis, the revenue generated in the China region increased by 7.1%."
"This increase was driven by sharp 
comparable revenue growth in the Advanced Therapies segment and by significant and very strong revenue growth at Varian 
and Imaging, respectively."
"Also in this region, the Diagnostics segment sustained a clear decline in revenue."
"This was due to 
lockdowns and increased COVID-19 infection rates at the beginning of the fiscal year, for which reason fewer routine tests were 
performed."
"Towards the end of fiscal year 2022, however, the segment benefited from higher test volumes for routine 
examinations after the COVID-19 restrictions were eased."
"Siemens Healthineers 
Adjusted EBIT declined by 16% from the prior year to €3,081 million in fiscal year 2023, yielding an adjusted EBIT margin of 
14.2%, as compared to 16.8% in the prior year."
"This decline was mainly caused by clearly lower earnings contributions from the 
business with rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, which ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023."
"Furthermore, costs for the 
transformation of the Diagnostics segment had a negative impact."
"Moreover, the prior year’s result was supported by below-
average expenses for performance-related remuneration components in all segments."
"The earnings contributions from revenue 
development, and currency effects, had a positive impact in the current fiscal year."
"Research and development expenses increased by €81 million, or approximately 5%."
"Adjusted for currency translation, they rose 
moderately from the prior-year level."
Research and development intensity was around 9% (prior year: around 8%).
Selling and general administrative expenses increased by €199 million or almost 6%.
"Adjusted for currency translation, these 
expenses rose by a mid-single digit percentage from the prior-year level."
"Segments 
Against the backdrop of the positive revenue development, the Imaging segment’s adjusted EBIT margin was 21.7%, and 
therefore higher than the prior-year level of 20.4%."
"Furthermore, currency effects had a positive impact."
"Adjusted EBIT rose to 
€2,569 million."
"The adjusted EBIT margin of the Diagnostics segment was −2.6%, below the prior-year level of 15.4%, mainly due to the clearly 
lower earnings contributions from sales of rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, which ended in the fourth quarter."
"In addition, currency effects as well as lockdowns and increased COVID-19 
infection rates in China at the beginning of the fiscal year had a negative impact."
"This was partially offset by initial cost 
reductions in connection with the transformation program."
"The adjusted EBIT margin of Diagnostics excluding the business with 
rapid COVID-19 antigen tests and excluding transformation costs was −0,8%."
Adjusted EBIT amounted to €−117 million.
Varian’s adjusted EBIT margin of 15.1% was below the prior-year level of 15.9% due to negative currency effects.
"Earnings 
contributions from the positive revenue development strengthened the margin."
Adjusted EBIT rose to €538 million.
"Against the backdrop of the very strong revenue development, the adjusted EBIT margin of Advanced Therapies of 15.4% was 
above the prior-year level of 12.5%."
Positive currency effects also contributed to this result.
Adjusted EBIT rose to €311 million.
"The line item amortization, depreciation and other effects from IFRS 3 purchase price allocation adjustments decreased to 
€393 million."
The prior-year period included higher effects in connection with the Varian acquisition.
Severance charges increased by €96 million to €167 million.
"This was mainly due to higher severance charges in connection with 
the transformation of the Diagnostics business."
Expenses for other portfolio-related measures were €349 million.
"This was due to the focusing of the endovascular robotics 
solution exclusively on neurovascular interventions, and the associated withdrawal from the robotic-assisted endovascular 
cardiology business, in the Advanced Therapies segment."
"The financial income, net changed by €80 million to €−207 million, in particular due to higher interest expenses for loans related 
to the financing of the Varian acquisition."
Income tax expenses decreased by €343 million to €403 million.
"The effective income tax rate in fiscal year 2023 was at 20.9%, 
well below the prior-year level of 26.6%."
"This was due to the release of tax provisions and further positive tax effects, including 
from new insights and assessments of discrete items."
"Please refer to  Note 5  
Income taxes in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements for additional information on this subject."
"Based on the effects described above, net income decreased by 26% to €1,525 million."
"These expenses were especially responsible 
for the higher adjustments compared to the prior year."
"A countervailing effect was contributed by lower adjustments resulting 
from amortization, depreciation and other effects from IFRS 3 purchase price allocation adjustments."
"This 
increase resulted mainly from strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, in particular in the Varian and 
Imaging segments, and in anticipation of a continued increase in business activity."
"Corresponding increases in trade and other 
receivables and in contract assets amounted to €205 million and €217 million, respectively."
"Inventories increased by €285 
million, due in particular to the expected growth of business activities in coming quarters and as well as last time buys."
"Trade 
payables and contract liabilities decreased due primarily to currency translation effects."
"Remaining current assets in the amount of €1,115 million were nearly on the level of the prior year."
"The increase in current 
income tax assets of €171 million resulted mainly from prepayments for the current fiscal year as these are determined on the 
basis of the previous year’s higher net income."
"This was offset by a decline of remaining current receivables from the Siemens 
Group of €112 million, which was primarily related to the settlement of receivables in connection with the pre-initial public 
offering group taxation with the Siemens Group in the United States."
"The amounts resulted from expanded options for tax loss 
carry-backs due to the CARES Act, which were aimed at mitigating the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal year 
2020."
"Remaining non-current assets decreased by €2,099 million, to €31,516 million."
"Therein, currency translation effects had a 
negative impact, particularly in the line items goodwill and other intangible assets."
"Furthermore, there were 
asset derecognitions in connection with the transformation of the Diagnostics business."
"For further information, please refer to 
 Note 13  
Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"In addition, 
deferred tax assets decreased by €159 million, mainly due to increased netting of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities."
"The acquisition of Block Imaging and Medical Physics (Aspekt Solutions) had an offsetting effect, in particular in the line items 
other intangible assets and goodwill."
"For further information, please refer to  Note 3  
Acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"Changes 
were attributable to income and expenditures from operations and to short-term investment or borrowing of liquidity."

As of September 30, 2023, net debt amounted to €13,128 million, an increase of €1,097 million compared to the prior year."
Along with currency translation effects related to U.S.
• Two loans granted by the Siemens Group in the total amount of US$ 2.0 billion were repaid in fiscal year 2023.
"For partial 
refinancing the Siemens Group provided two new fixed interest loans totaling €1.4 billion, maturing in fiscal years 2030 and 
2032."
"• An additional loan for general corporate purposes of Siemens Healthineers was granted by the Siemens Group in the amount 
of €0.3 billion, maturing in fiscal year 2026."
"• As of September 30, 2023, the credit facilities granted by the Siemens Group were utilized in an amount of €1,267 million 
(September 30, 2022: €200 million)."
"Furthermore, the positive fair value of forward contracts for hedging of foreign currency liabilities from financing activities 
decreased by about €1.2 billion as a result of the exchange rate development between U.S."
"These derivatives 
were entered into to hedge the foreign currency risks of loans denominated in U.S."
"For further information regarding 
derivatives, please refer to  Note 26  
Financial instruments and hedging activities in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"Pensions 
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased due mainly to increased discount rates in countries with significant 
pension commitments."
"In aggregate, the line item decreased by €129 million."

"Except for the loan maturing in fiscal year 2046, which was held by an U.S."
"dollar-denominated loans were held 
by an entity located in Germany."
"The resulting foreign currency risks were hedged by forward exchange contracts and by foreign 
exchange swaps."
"As a result, the loans with fixed interest rates were effectively converted into synthetic euro-denominated 
loans, and actual interest expenses decreased due to positive forward elements of the forward exchange contracts and foreign 
exchange swaps."
"For the variable interest loan, only the nominal amount was hedged."
"In total, the actual current volume-
weighted average interest rate of the U.S."
dollar-denominated loans amounts to approximately 0.6%.
"As of September 30, 2023, Siemens Healthineers continued to participate in the cash pooling of the Siemens Group, which 
included the short-term investment of excess liquidity and the borrowing of short-term funds within the Siemens Group."
Currently excluded therefrom are the entities that were acquired as part of the acquisition of Varian in fiscal year 2021.
"Siemens 
Healthineers intends to set up its own cash pooling in the medium term to (partially) replace participation in the cash pooling of 
the Siemens Group."
"In addition, local bank facilities are in place to ensure the funding needs of some Siemens Healthineers entities that have no 
access to direct funding within Siemens Healthineers."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023

In fiscal year 2023, the credit facilities granted by the Siemens Group were increased and extended until January 31, 2026."
"Consequently, as of September 30, 2023, financing arrangements of Siemens Healthineers with Siemens AG consisted of a 
multicurrency revolving credit facility of up to €2.5 billion (September 30, 2022: €1.1 billion)."
"This serves to finance net working 
capital and as a short-term credit facility, as well as a multicurrency revolving credit facility of up to €2.0 billion (September 30, 
2022: €1.0 billion) as a backup facility."
"As of the reporting date both credit facilities were utilized, as mentioned above, in the 
amount of €1.267 million (September 30, 2022: €200 million)."
"Please refer to  Note 16  
Financial debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on financial 
debt."
"For more information on financial risk management responsibilities and objectives, please refer to  Note 27  
Financial risk 
management in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Remaining current liabilities in the amount of €3,116 million were nearly on the level of the prior year."
"Other current liabilities 
increased by €191 million mainly due to higher accruals related to performance-related remuneration components."
"The lower 
amount in the fiscal year 2022 was due to below-average accruals for performance-related remuneration in all segments."
"This 
was partly offset by a decrease in other current financial liabilities of €91 million, mainly due to a decline in the negative market 
values of forward contracts for hedging of operational foreign currency risks."
"In addition, current income tax liabilities decreased 
by €147 million, particularly in connection with payment of income taxes from the prior fiscal year."
"Remaining non-current liabilities decreased by €388 million to €2,313 million."
"In particular, deferred tax liabilities decreased by 
€447 million, due to amortization and impairments of intangible assets, currency translation effects, and an increased netting of 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities."
"Retained earnings increased by €487 million, mainly due to net income 
of €1,525 million for fiscal year 2023."
"This was partly offset by dividend payments of €1,066 million."
"Other components of 
equity decreased by €2,018 million, due in particular to currency translation differences."
"In fiscal year 2023, an increased 
number of treasury shares was repurchased to fulfill share-based payment programs based on shares of Siemens 
Healthineers AG."
"Thus, treasury shares increased by €202 million to €607 million."
"Please refer to  Note 24  
Equity in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding equity."
"The change in operating net working capital 
had a negative impact on cash flows from operating activities of €1,105 million, €927 million more than in the previous fiscal 
year."
"This includes, in particular, a lower release of funds, compared to the prior fiscal year, in connection with contract liabilities 
and trade payables in the amounts of €403 million and €267 million, respectively."
"This was partly offset by the change in other 
reconciling items to cash flows from operating activities, mainly related to other assets and liabilities."
"This resulted mainly from 
the fact that, in contrast to the previous fiscal year, non-cash expenses for performance-related income components were 
significantly higher than the cash payouts."
"Investing activities 
Cash outflows from investing activities increased by €200 million to €1,069 million."
"The increase compared to fiscal year 2022 
was due to payments for acquisitions of businesses."
"For further information regarding the acquisition of Block Imaging and 
Medical Physics (Aspekt Solutions), please refer to  Note 3  
Acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Financing activities 
Cash flows from financing activities decreased by €955 million to €−690 million."
"This was mainly a result of increased utilization 
of credit facilities provided by the Siemens Group."
"There was an offsetting effect from the increase of €111 million in payouts for 
dividends to shareholders of Siemens Healthineers AG amounting to €1,066 million, as well as from payouts for the repurchase 
of treasury shares to fulfill share-based payment programs, which increased by €112 million."
"The main capital 
expenditures were for additions to intangible assets, including capitalized development expenses, as well as for replacements 
and enhancements of property, plant and equipment in the ordinary course of business."
"The investments were also made taking 
into account aspects of climate protection and the continuous improvement of the sustainability standards of our sites."
"The segments’ additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment focused especially on the following: 
Imaging: In fiscal year 2023, additions mainly included capacity expansions, acquisition of special tooling and machinery, and 
automation solutions."
"Diagnostics: In fiscal year 2023, additions to intangible assets were primarily attributable to product developments within the 
Atellica product line."
"Additions to property, plant and equipment mainly related to production facilities in China and the United 
States."
"Varian: In fiscal year 2023, additions mainly comprised capacity increases and business expansions as well as replacements."
"Advanced Therapies: In fiscal year 2023, additions were made primarily to equip training centers with equipment for the Artis 
Icono product family."
"Siemens Healthineers had contractual obligations as of September 30, 2023, to purchase property, plant and equipment totaling 
€160 million (September 30, 2022: €173 million)."
"These are mainly future payments related to real estate and will be financed 
mainly through the cash pooling of the Siemens Group."
"A.3.4 Overall assessment of the economic position 
With respect to our outlook provided in the Annual Report 2022, we expected for fiscal year 2023: 
• For Siemens Healthineers: comparable revenue growth of between −1% and 1% and adjusted basic earnings per share 
between €2.00 and €2.20."
"•  
For the Imaging segment: comparable revenue growth of between 7% and 9% and an adjusted EBIT margin of between 21% 
and 22.5%."
"•  
For the Diagnostics segment: comparable revenue growth of between −21% and −19% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 
between 0% and 3%."
"• For the Varian segment: comparable revenue growth of between 9% and 12% and an adjusted EBIT margin of between 16% 
and 18%."
"•  
For the Advanced Therapies segment: comparable revenue growth of between 6% and 9% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 
between 13% and 15%."
"We updated the segment-level expectations for Diagnostics communicated in the Annual Report 2022 in our Half Year Financial 
Report and for Varian after the third quarter (see the table below)."
"With respect to Diagnostics, these adjustments were due to a 
COVID-19-related revenue decline in the China region, where fewer routine tests were performed, which could not be fully made 
up in the further course of the fiscal year."
"With respect to Varian, they were due to higher expected costs."
"The comments below 
refer to the last updated outlook."
"This outlook was based on several assumptions, including 
assumptions regarding the development of exchange rates, which had been updated from the outlook provided in the Annual 
Report 2022."
"A clear change in exchange rates had produced a negative effect of more than €0.10 on the expected adjusted 
basic earnings per share for fiscal year 2023."
"At the end of the fiscal year, this effect even increased to almost €0.20."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Business development 
 
26 
The comparable revenue growth of Siemens Healthineers in fiscal year 2023 was 1.2%, and therefore slightly higher than the 
upper end of the range we had anticipated."
"On a comparable basis, the total adjusted revenue of Imaging increased by 10.9% and that of Varian by 14.8%, surpassing our 
expectations for comparable revenue growth in these segments."
"The comparable revenue growth of Diagnostics was −24.2%, 
within the expected corridor of the outlook Q3 2023."
"The comparable revenue growth of Advanced Therapies was likewise 
within the expected corridor, at 7.8%."
"The adjusted EBIT margin of Imaging was 21.7%, within the forecast range."
"The adjusted EBIT margin of Diagnostics was −2.6% 
and thus also within the expected range of the outlook Q3 2023."
"Varian’s adjusted EBIT margin of 15.1% was at the upper end of 
the target corridor of the outlook Q3 2023."
"The adjusted EBIT margin of Advanced Therapies came to 15.4%, slightly higher than 
expected."
"Net income decreased by 26% to €1,525 million, mainly as a result of the lower EBIT."
"The lower net income led to a 12% 
decrease in adjusted basic earnings per share, to €2.02."
"Thus, adjusted basic earnings per share came out within the target 
corridor we had anticipated."
"Overall, we fulfilled our outlook at group level for Siemens Healthineers in fiscal year 2023."
"The Managing Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting the distribution of a dividend 
of €0.95 per share entitled to the dividend."
"This amount, which is the same as in the prior year, corresponds to an expected total 
payout of approximately €1,060 million."
This corresponds to a dividend payout percentage of approximately 70%.

A.5 Report on expected developments 
The following outlook is based on the financial performance system that will be effective from fiscal year 2024  A.2 Financial 
performance system."
There is no material impact on the adjusted EBIT margin for the other segments.
"A.5.1 Expected market development 
The international COVID-19 health emergency was declared over by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 5 May, 2023."
"Based on the developments during the fiscal year and the lifting of pandemic restrictions almost everywhere in the world, we do 
not expect any further significant effects on our markets."
"Nonetheless, the markets for all our segments are being influenced by 
other geopolitical and macroeconomic factors."
"The medical technology sector could be adversely affected by factors such as the 
ongoing instability and uncertainty in Ukraine and the attendant consequences, as well as further developments in the trade 
conflict between the United States and China."
"We are closely monitoring the escalating conflict in the Middle East, especially the 
potential adverse effects on monetary policy, energy prices, and our markets."
"It is expected that inflation, which also affects our 
markets, will continue to weaken."
The already serious shortage of hospital staff will remain in effect and worsen even further.
Higher wages are putting additional pressure on strained healthcare budgets.
"Debt accumulated in the course of combating 
COVID-19 could further restrict the flexibility needed to make new investments."
"Any resulting budget reallocations and 
heightened price sensitivity in the markets of our individual businesses could have mixed effects on our business."
"Many 
healthcare systems across the world are still planning to bolster their resilience while also improving the quality of healthcare 
delivered to their populations."
"The government spending programs adopted on this basis also include larger investments in 
national healthcare systems and measures to stimulate innovation."
"The positive effects on relevant market segments within the 
medical technology sector and on certain digital technologies (e.g."
"telemedicine, artificial intelligence, and big data) could 
continue in the coming fiscal years."
"The effects of the above-mentioned geopolitical and macroeconomic risks on our addressable markets and on our ability to 
reliably assess the future development of our markets remain challenging, nevertheless."
"We are constantly evaluating the 
development of these risks however, including potential measures to reform national healthcare systems and the further course 
of inflation."
"Now that the pandemic has ended, though, the usual patterns of past development in the markets of Siemens 
Healthineers can serve as a more reliable basis for forecasts."
"Generally speaking, we believe that the underlying trends described 
in Chapter  A.1.2 Business environment remain intact."
"Moderate growth overall is expected in the Imaging segment’s markets in fiscal year 2024, driven mainly by pent-up demand for 
the major imaging modalities."
"Additional demand will also come from digital growth fields such as AI-based clinical decision 
support and telemedicine."
"These fields are also becoming increasingly relevant precisely because automation of workflows and 
technologies such as remote control of imaging equipment are being used as a way of coping with the shortage of personnel in 
the healthcare sector."
Increasing price sensitivity could become a challenge for the market.
Slight growth is expected for the Diagnostics market (excluding COVID-19 tests and molecular diagnostics) in fiscal year 2024.
The anticipated slowdown of global market growth is primarily the result of lower growth expectations in China.
"The continuing, 
staggered roll-out of volume-based procurement across all market segments and the government’s ongoing price control 
measures are expected to have an adverse impact on the healthcare market in China."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Report on expected developments 
 
29 
Strong growth is expected in the market of the Varian segment, driven by easing of supply chain disruptions and resumption of 
oncology investments."
"In the developed markets, such investments are expected to be driven by customers’ demand for new 
products, a healthy replacement market, and services that allow for the implementation of advanced oncology therapies and 
treatment solutions."
"In developing markets, investments will be driven by the need to improve the still inadequate access to 
basic oncology equipment and services for many patients."
The trend of strong growth in the market for the Advanced Therapies segment is expected to continue in fiscal year 2024.
"Market 
growth will be supported by higher levels of worldwide replacement purchases and government support programs."
"Market 
growth will also be supported by continuing investments in surgery and cardiology and the need for new equipment associated 
with the rising number of outpatient centers for surgical applications."
"A.5.2 Expected business development 
In fiscal year 2024, as in the prior year, comparable revenue growth and adjusted EBIT margin for the segments directly influence 
the most significant financial key performance indicators used to monitor and control Siemens Healthineers."
"The following 
assumptions are based on the definition of the adjusted EBIT margin effective from fiscal year 2024  A.2 Financial performance 
system."
"Development in the Imaging segment will be based primarily on recent and planned launches of new products and platforms 
along with sales of imaging products and services from our existing portfolio."
"In fiscal year 2024, we expect comparable revenue 
growth of between 6.0% and 8.0% in the Imaging segment and an adjusted EBIT margin of between 21.0% and 22.5%."
"Our business expectations for the Diagnostics segment are based on new products and an improvement in diagnostic techniques 
as well as an anticipated increased demand from emerging markets and an anticipated rise in awareness regarding preventive 
health checks (wellness testing)."
"The outlook is based on the assumption that we will not generate revenues from rapid COVID-
19 antigen tests anymore."
"In fiscal year 2024, we expect comparable revenue for the Diagnostics segment to be approximately 
on a par with the prior fiscal year."
"Excluding rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, we expect comparable revenue growth in the 
Diagnostics segment of between 2.0% and 4.0%."
We expect an adjusted EBIT margin of between 2.5% and 4.5%.
"Development in the Varian segment will be determined by sales of comprehensive multi-modality cancer care technologies, 
services, and digital solutions and applications."
Continued portfolio expansion will support our growth expectations.
"In fiscal year 
2024, we expect comparable revenue growth of between 8.0% and 10.0% in the Varian segment and an adjusted EBIT margin of 
between 15.0% and 17.0%."
"Our growth expectations for the Advanced Therapies segment are based on a sustainable development of the business 
environment in all addressed clinical areas and the megatrend of minimally invasive interventions."
"In fiscal year 2024, we expect 
comparable revenue growth of between 5.0% and 8.0% in the Advanced Therapies segment and an adjusted EBIT margin of 
between 15.0% and 17.0%."
"Excluding revenue from rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, this corresponds to comparable revenue growth of between 5.0% and 
7.0%."
We expect adjusted basic earnings per share to be between €2.10 and €2.30.
"We are exposed to exchange rate effects, particularly involving the U."
"dollar, the Chinese yuan and the currencies of emerging 
markets."
We expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal year 2024.
"Siemens Healthineers is still a net 
exporter from the euro zone into the rest of the world, which means that in terms of absolute values a weak euro is generally 
favorable for our business and a strong euro is in principle unfavorable."
"We use derivative financial instruments to hedge 
currency risks in our business."
"We expect this measure to help us limit effects on income related to exchange rate fluctuations in 
fiscal year 2024."
"Additionally, the outlook is based on further assumptions: This includes the expectation that the current macroeconomic 
environment, including the current level of interest rates, will remain largely unchanged."
"Furthermore, from today’s point of 
view we expect the market in China will pick up by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2024."
"In addition, the outlook is 
based on assumptions about exchange rate developments, which currently lead to a negative currency effect of around €0.08 on 
the expected adjusted basic earnings per share for fiscal year 2024 compared with fiscal year 2023."
"Furthermore, this outlook 
excludes potential portfolio measures."
"In addition, the outlook is based on the assumption that developments related to the war 
in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East will not have a material impact on our business activities."
"The outlook is based on the 
number of shares outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2023."
"This outlook also excludes charges from legal, tax and regulatory 
issues and framework conditions."
"The actual development for Siemens Healthineers and the segments may vary, positively or negatively, from our outlook due to 
the opportunities and risks described in the following chapter or if our expectations and assumptions do not materialize."
Hence it is essential to manage risks and opportunities appropriately.
Our risk management is therefore an integral part of the planning and implementation of our business strategies.
"The risk 
management policy is set by the Managing Board."
"In accordance with our organizational and accountability structure, the 
respective management of a business, region or function is obliged to implement a comprehensive risk management system."
"This is tailored to their specific area and its responsibilities, while at the same time being consistent with the overall policy."
"Company-wide risk management process and organization (Enterprise Risk Management Process) 
We make use of a coordinated set of risk management and control systems."
"These support us in the early recognition of 
developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business."
"The most important of these systems include our company-
wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting."
"Strategic planning is intended to support us in assessing 
potential risks and opportunities well in advance of major business decisions."
"Management reporting is intended to enable us to 
monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses."
"Our risk management and its contributing elements are regularly 
subject to audit activities by our internal audit function."
"Accordingly, if deficits are detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate 
measures to eliminate them."
"This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board 
and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner."
"Risk management at Siemens Healthineers builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) approach."
This approach is integrated into the organization and addresses both risks and opportunities.
"The frameworks connect the 
ERM process with our financial reporting process, our internal control system and compliance management system."
"They 
consider the company’s strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations, the reliability of its financial 
reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important."
"Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response to, risks and opportunities that could materially 
affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives."
"The time horizon within the ERM 
approach is typically three years, and based on a net approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution 
of existing and effective control measures."
"If risks or opportunities have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or 
the financial statements (for example as a provision or risk contingency), they have been incorporated, with their financial 
impact, in the entity’s business objectives."
"As a consequence, only additional risks or opportunities arising from the same subject 
(for example deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered for the ERM."
"In order to 
provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities including social and environmental factors are 
identified in a structured procedure."
This combines elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches.
"While reporting 
generally follows a quarterly cycle, this regular reporting process is complemented by an ad hoc reporting process that aims to 
escalate critical issues in a timely manner."
"Relevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, 
considering different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory matters."
"The bottom-up 
identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of the Siemens 
Healthineers businesses and regions."
"This top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at 
the management level and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant."
"Reported risks and 
opportunities are analyzed for their potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational 
levels mentioned above."
Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities.
"The hierarchical assignment of responsibility depends on the 
significance of the risk or opportunity."
"In a first step, assuming responsibility involves choosing one of our general response 
strategies."
"The general response strategies with respect to risks are to avoid, transfer, reduce, retain or watch the relevant risk."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Report on material risks and opportunities 
 
32 
The general response strategy for opportunities is to pursue the opportunity concerned."
"In a second step, responsibilities involve 
developing, initiating and monitoring appropriate response measures according to the chosen response strategy, within an 
appropriate time frame."
"To allow for effective risk management, these response measures must be specifically tailored to 
relevant circumstances."
"Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures."
"In order to allow for a meaningful discussion at the Company level, individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect 
nature are aggregated into risk and opportunity themes."
"This aggregation naturally results in a mixture of risks, including those 
with a primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative assessment."
"Accordingly, we do not adopt a 
purely quantitative assessment of risk themes."
The same applies for opportunities.
"The quarterly risk and opportunity 
assessments as well as our bi-annual risk-bearing capacity assessment then form the basis for the evaluation of the company-
wide risk and opportunity situation."
"A.6.2 Risks 
Hereafter we describe risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business objectives, net assets, financial position 
(including effects on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation."
"The order in which the risks are 
presented in each of the four categories reflects the current assessment of the relative risk exposure for Siemens Healthineers 
and thus provides an indication of the risks’ current importance to us."
"Additional risks not known to us or that we currently 
consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business objectives and operations."
"Unless otherwise stated, the risks 
described below relate to all our segments."
"A.6.2.1 Strategic risks 
Economic, Political and Geopolitical Developments 
We operate production, development and service facilities in a number of countries and market our products, solutions and 
services worldwide."
"There is an increase in governmental protectionism 
in recent years due to shifts in the geopolitical landscape, weakness of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and growing 
populism, among other things."
"We could be confronted with increasing protectionist trade policies and barriers such as import 
and export controls, tariffs, environmental taxes, and non-refundable taxes on foreign value added."
"Other protectionist measures 
could include the imposition of localization requirements or local ownership and shareholder regulations as well as other 
regulatory burdens."
Those policies and measures could negatively affect our business and market share.
"They could also reduce 
our profits if we cannot pass additional costs along to customers."
"In addition, we might be exposed to penalties and sanctions or 
have a worse competitive position in bidding processes."
"Furthermore, the United States and China are important markets, and 
the trade conflict between the two countries burdens our business."
"In addition to punitive tariffs, the trade conflict also carries 
the risk that free market access will be impaired."
"Additional governmental influences and regulations in key countries, such as 
China’s five-year plans, could negatively affect our development in such countries and result in a loss of market share."
"Further 
risks stem from geopolitical tensions (for example concerning Russia, Ukraine, China, Taiwan, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Serbia, 
Kosovo and Israel) and conflicts that are already ongoing or may potentially arise."
"Especially the war in Ukraine and its broad 
geopolitical and macroeconomic consequences could continue to adversely impact our business."
"We also see some uncertainty 
regarding the current European political environment and growth of populism across European countries."
"This affects unity in 
foreign policy, stability of fiscal policy and further debates regarding national independence."
"Besides, a slowdown or decline of 
global macroeconomic growth could lead to adverse effects on our business."
"Healthcare markets, especially in emerging 
countries, might not achieve the growth we anticipated."
"In addition, we might face higher costs for the sourcing of materials, 
parts and components if inflation persists or increases."
"We might not be able to successfully adapt our production and cost 
structure to changes in our markets which could result in margin erosion."
"If we do not meet market requirements, we might 
experience declining demand for our products and lose market share to our competitors."
"In some sectors in which we operate, 
consolidation on the customer side is increasing."
"If our customers combine through mergers and acquisitions, join group 
purchasing organizations or otherwise collectively enter our markets, it could result in lower sales volumes and higher price 
pressure."
"To counter these risks and identify critical cases, we constantly monitor economic, political and geopolitical 
developments and their indicators."
"Based on this we adapt our processes and business model to possible changes arising from 
protectionism, ensure compliance with legal requirements, and educate our organization about these changes."
"In addition, we 
set up dedicated task forces and coordinate local response plans where necessary."
"We also maintain an exchange of information 
within industrial associations and take advantage of opportunities to engage in discussions with local authorities."
"Other 
measures include strategic and sales push initiatives, the implementation of productivity measures, projects to achieve target 
costs, optimization of our product portfolio or price increases."
"Siemens Healthineers’ global setup, with operations in almost all 
relevant economies, together with the variety of our products and services, can contribute to offset the impact of an unfavorable 
development in a single market."
"Due to the volatile situation and uncertainty of the full extent of current developments the 
Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Report on material risks and opportunities 
 
33 
worldwide effects and consequences cannot be fully anticipated."
"We continue to observe these on an ongoing basis in order to 
quickly identify changes, evaluate potential impacts, assess risks, adjust our measures accordingly and strengthen our resilience."
"Competitive Environment 
The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service 
quality, product development and introduction time, customer service and financing terms."
"Market demand might vary, partly 
due to rapid and significant changes resulting from the introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies."
"There could be 
increasing competition from existing competitors that want to expand their business with new portfolio elements, introduce new 
business models, or expand their global presence."
"Against the backdrop of rapid technological progress, new companies 
previously outside the industry, such as IT companies or AI start-ups might also become competitors for our digital portfolio."
"Besides that, there could also be new competition such as medical technology companies in the low-price segment or niche 
markets, as well as independent service organizations."
"Some of our competitors may have more experience or greater resources 
in certain fields."
"Moreover, some of our products address markets that are still developing and characterized by rapidly evolving 
technology, varying degrees of market acceptance, and pricing pressure."
"We are also impacted by the pricing decisions of our 
competitors, the timing of their product introductions, and the rate of market penetration by competitive products, which could 
render our products less competitive."
"If we cannot successfully provide technically superior, proven products that deliver more 
precise, cost-effective, high-quality clinical capabilities, in a complete package of products and services, ahead of our 
competitors, we might lose market share and be forced to adapt our prices."
"New competitors may also delay the purchasing 
decisions of customers if they decide to evaluate the products of such competitors along with ours, potentially extending our 
sales cycle and adversely affecting our orders and revenues."
Competing companies could receive preferential treatment in the countries in which they are domiciled.
"In 
addition, new regulations such as the EU Data Act may enable competitors who are able to use the regulations to their 
advantage to undermine our competitive position, resulting in increased price pressure and loss of market share."
"We counter 
these risks by constantly monitoring existing competitors, known potential competitors, and barriers to market entry, as well as 
by adapting our strategies and measures accordingly."
"Other measures include benchmarking, strategic initiatives, sales push 
initiatives, lobbying and the implementation of productivity measures and projects to achieve target costs."
"We achieve this for 
instance by adjustment of operational structures, outsourcing, mergers and establishment of joint ventures, as well as by 
exporting from low-cost countries to price-sensitive markets and optimizing our product portfolio."
"Diagnostics Transformation 
This transformation program announced in November 2022 focuses on optimizing the existing product portfolio and footprint as 
well as further organizational and functional optimization in the Diagnostics segment."
"It carries an execution risk due to the 
complexity of the undertaking and its ambitious timeline."
"We rely on product launches of strategically relevant analyzers to 
subsequently be able to reduce the total number of active platforms, thereby establishing a healthy product portfolio and 
related, optimized go-to-market approach."
"Launches of strategic relevance are associated with inherent technical and market 
risk."
"Furthermore, in connection with the establishment of a leaner organization and the verticalization of customer-facing 
operations in the individual regions, there is a risk of losing institutional and procedural knowledge if we do not manage to 
accompany this with successful change management."
"In addition, necessary right-sizing of our organization and footprint is 
conducted in partnership with the respective codetermination councils in order to implement them swiftly and minimize 
disruption to our business."
"While in most cases this is agreed directly between the company and local codetermination councils, 
in some countries, such as Germany, the severance of employees takes place on a voluntary basis."
"This entails the risk that 
personnel and associated site adjustments may take longer than planned."
"To manage these risks, we have implemented a 
number of measures, such as regular reviews in the management team to improve the maturity of each key measure and drive 
progress towards specific KPIs."
"In addition, major product launches are implemented with a controlled rollout phase to identify 
and address issues prior to full commercial launch."
Other portfolio transformation measures are prepared with product testing.
Systematic knowledge transfer and the further development of our corporate culture are also planned.
"All this will be 
accompanied by support from internal experts in collaboration with external consultants and a clear execution plan for the 
organizational changes."
"Transactional Risks (M&A) 
Our business strategy includes the acquisition of companies and business activities that expand or complement our existing 
business, among others."
"Successful growth through acquisitions is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition 
targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, and ultimately complete such 
transactions, as well as to integrate the acquired companies successfully."
"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are generally 
associated with risks due to the difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products."
"Our 
assessments and assumptions regarding acquisition targets may not prove to be correct and actual developments may differ 
significantly from our expectations."
This could mean that the expected synergies such as cost savings may not be fully realized.
"In addition, it is possible that the intended combination of companies, processes and employees will be more complex than 
expected and cannot be completed within the planned time frame."
"Acquisitions could lead to an increased and unsustainable 
workload for employees as well as affect employee engagement and well-being."
"This could negatively impact our 
know-how and our ability to innovate as well as our relations with customers, suppliers, partners licensors or other stakeholders."
"Furthermore, unforeseen acquisition, administrative, tax and other expenditures may incur in connection with these 
transactions, including costs related to integration of acquired businesses."
"Should the business performance of the acquired 
company be below our expectations on a lasting basis, this could lead to impairment losses, in particular on goodwill and 
intangible assets, which could adversely affect our net assets and results of operations."
"We counter these risks by carefully 
selecting the companies to be acquired and by conducting thorough due diligence."
"We also create detailed integration plans, set 
up integration projects and strive to implement them in a way that countermeasures can be initiated in a timely manner."
"Moreover, we support the integration of corporate cultures and change management by providing clarity about organizational 
structures to employees and developing and executing clear communication plans."
"In addition, we strive to achieve and maintain 
employee loyalty through adequate incentive and compensation programs as well as access to additional benefits."
"A.6.2.2 Operational risks 
Cybersecurity 
We observe a global increase of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of sophistication in cybercrime in the healthcare industry, 
intensified by current geopolitical crises."
"With our business in healthcare, the products, solutions, and services of Siemens 
Healthineers are therefore exposed to a particularly high cyber risk."
"Disruption of our critical information systems, significant 
cyberattacks or security breaches of our products may adversely affect our business and customer relations."
"As an example, 
ransomware attacks against healthcare providers have major impacts on the provision of healthcare services and continue to be 
a significant risk to healthcare providers, threatening both patient treatment and the security of sensitive patient data."
"There are 
increasingly large volumes of information, including patient data, being generated that need to be securely processed and stored 
by the healthcare organizations involved."
"In the event of cyber-attacks, the security of the data and the privacy of the patients 
treated with the help of our products and solutions could be at risk."
"In addition, in the event of an attack our supply chains could 
also be at risk and interruptions could have a negative impact on our business."
"A security breach could have serious 
negative consequences, including regulatory action, fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our products and 
solutions, an unwillingness of our customers to use our products and solutions, and harm to our reputation and brand."
"The 
number and criticality of attacks against Siemens Healthineers, however, have not changed significantly."
"Besides that, we 
operate across different jurisdictions and observe an increasing number of cybersecurity regulations."
"Amongst other regulations 
the NIS2 (Network and Information Security) directive may amplify actions by regulatory bodies regarding data privacy and 
cybersecurity."
"To address the risk, we have a global cybersecurity organization which engages all relevant areas of our company 
and integrates cybersecurity resources, expertise, and competence."
"The cybersecurity organization is governed and supported by 
a central team which is responsible for cybersecurity strategy, governance, and assurance."
"Our cybersecurity management 
system is certified under ISO 27001 and 27701 standards."
"In addition, we are committed to security and privacy by design and 
default, for both products and internal operations."
"Besides our established technical and organizational controls, we 
continuously strengthen the awareness of our employees so they can detect attacks at an early stage and respond even more 
effectively."
This is particularly important as the number of employees working remotely is expected to remain on a high level.
"Moreover, we support business resilience with a focus on expanding, adapting and improving established security controls across 
the organization and the supply chain."
"Cybersecurity has a strategic relevance for sustainable business which is why that it is an 
essential part of our sustainability program."
"Furthermore, cybersecurity is a shared responsibility of all involved parties, and 
therefore we are also continually developing our ability to support our customers to protect themselves from cyberattacks."
"We 
have expanded our collaborations with healthcare providers, industry, partners, regulators and security researchers in line with 
the Charter of Trust principles for a secure digital world, through customer advisory boards, development of internal standards 
and exchanges of threat intelligence."
"Supply Chain Management (SCM) 
We purchase parts, components, services and materials from third parties, contract manufacturers and service providers all over 
the world."
"In addition, we rely upon the supplies of certain resources such as raw materials and 
energy."
"Worldwide demand, availability and pricing of these resources have been volatile recently, and we expect that they will 
continue to fluctuate in the future."
"Changes in customer demand and market fluctuations for critical parts and components 
might lead to difficulties in meeting our quality requirements while also purchasing in sufficient quantities at competitive market 
prices."
"Delays, restrictions, shortages or unavailability of supplies of important resources could lead to unanticipated price 
increases and could constrain our production of affected products, which could in turn reduce our profit margins or otherwise 
adversely affect our performance."
"Some of 
the components included in our products are obtained from a limited group of suppliers or from a sole-source supplier."
"We are 
also dependent on our own production and distribution sites."
"If a supplier's operations are disrupted, if we lose a critical supplier, 
or if one of them no longer meets performance or quality specifications, we may be required to obtain and qualify one or more 
replacement suppliers."
"Such an event may then also require us to redesign or modify our products to incorporate new parts 
and/or further require us to obtain clearance, qualification, certification or other applicable regulatory approvals of these 
products."
"Events such as these could significantly increase costs for the affected product and cause material delays in delivery of 
our products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations."
"To counter these risks, we 
address them at an early stage of the product life cycle when developing new products."
"Besides that, we work closely with 
reliable and competent suppliers to ensure consistent supplies and minimize disruptions to our supply chain."
"We also conduct 
screenings and audits of our suppliers with regard to delivery capabilities, among other things, in order to proactively establish 
relevant measures."
"In addition, we retain certain safety stocks and qualify second-source suppliers for essential components."
"We 
also manage procurement and pricing through measures such as long-term contracts and hedging as well as bundling of 
demands across units within our company and the Siemens Group."
"Moreover, we actively monitor price developments to be able 
to react early to market changes."
"Furthermore, we review and adjust our footprint and design our value-added structures to be 
more resilient and agile."
"Product Development and Introduction 
We develop, produce and sell a comprehensive portfolio of products, solutions and services (including accessories and software 
products) to a wide range of healthcare providers."
"With many of our products, solutions and services we are an industry-wide 
technology leader."
"Our results of operations depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership, as well as our ability 
to anticipate changes in our markets and to adapt the costs of producing our products to those changes."
"Our products, solutions, 
services and their enhancements often have long cycles of development and government approval."
"As a result, this requires us to 
maintain early and accurate anticipation of relevant changes in the marketplace, in technology and in customer demands."
Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and development.
"We may need to 
spend more time and money than anticipated to develop and introduce new products, product enhancements or services, and 
may not be able to recover all or a meaningful part of our investments."
"Our results of operations could be negatively impacted if 
we invest in technologies that do not operate as expected or cannot be integrated as planned, or that do not find the expected 
market acceptance."
"The same applies if our products, solutions or services are not introduced to the market at the targeted 
margins or in a timely manner, particularly compared to our competitors, or even become obsolete."
"If we are not able to meet 
clinical needs and provide operational as well as financial benefits to customers, we might not achieve anticipated growth and 
cash flows."
This might lead to negative financial impacts such as the potential recognition of an impairment loss.
"Furthermore, 
errors in the design of our products or operational disruptions in our value chain could result in quality problems or potential 
product, labor safety, regulatory or environmental risks."
"The correction of errors could lead to unforeseen costs, at the same time 
resulting in guarantee or warranty claims, and, moreover, adversely impact our reputation."
"Our patents and other intellectual 
property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that resemble or 
replicate our own."
"If we are unable to protect or effectively enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties, we 
might lose our technological leadership position and market share which could result in negative financial impact, loss of 
reputation or loss of customers."
"To counter these risks, we continuously initiate and implement measures for quality 
improvement, project risk management and claim prevention that contribute to the mitigation of existing risks."
"In addition, we 
closely monitor market developments and are in regular exchange with customers and governments in order to identify and 
react to new demands early on, for example by jointly co-creating solutions with them especially in the area of digitalization."
"We 
constantly apply for new patents and actively manage our intellectual property portfolio to safeguard our leading technological 
position."
"An increase of provisions for pensions due to an adverse development of plan assets or the defined benefit obligation 
is considered a significant risk."
"The funded status can be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount 
rate, as well as by movements in financial markets."
"In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign 
countries, we may face increasing cash outflows to reduce an underfunding of our pension plans in these countries."
"Regular 
asset liability studies are performed for major pension plans to implement an investment strategy to reduce liability risks and 
funded status volatility."
"Market Price Risks 
We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, especially between the U.S."
"dollar (and other currencies whose movements 
are positively correlated with the U.S."
"Depending on our hedging activities, devaluation of the U.S."
"dollar 
against the euro may result in material adverse effects on our profit."
"Other currencies of significance from the viewpoint of 
foreign currency effects include the Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Korean won and British pound."
"In addition, increasing 
exchange rate fluctuations may result in significant volatility risk for earnings and cash flows."
"We are also exposed to risks 
resulting from fluctuations in interest rates."
"In order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across our segments and 
entities, as well as to achieve our objectives, we identify, analyze and manage the associated financial market risks."
"We seek to 
manage and control these risks primarily through our regular operating and financing activities and use derivative financial 
instruments when deemed appropriate."
"Tax Risks 
Siemens Healthineers has global operations in a number of countries and is thus subject to multiple national tax regimes."
"At most 
Siemens Healthineers entities, the tax authorities in the respective jurisdictions carry out regular tax audits."
"Tax risks can arise 
from legal interpretations by tax authorities that diverge from ours, and from changes in legal provisions as well as in case law 
and their implementation, especially in cross-border transactions involving various jurisdictions."
"This can result in additional tax 
expenses and additional tax payments, double taxation and the imposition of penalties and interest payments, which would have 
a negative impact on the company’s profit and cash flow."
"In addition, there might be tax increases in certain countries which 
could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations."
"Tax-related risks are identified, regularly monitored and 
assessed by the tax department, and necessary measures are taken."
"Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and 
risk aversion in the financial markets might lead to adverse changes in the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities, 
particularly our derivative financial instruments."
"A failure to 
comply with existing, new or changed regulatory requirements could result in governmental fines and other sanctions, 
temporary or permanent shutdown of production facilities, third-party claims, import restrictions and negative publicity."
"This 
could affect our ability to deliver, our time to market for certain products or product life cycles and thus lead to unforeseen costs 
and have a negative impact on our financial position."
"Further, our business may be affected by new laws and regulations, in 
particular by those that may govern innovative products and business activities, including services and solutions, such as the use 
of artificial intelligence."
"For emerging subject areas, regulatory requirements are often not yet defined, or they may undergo 
future changes whose effects cannot yet be estimated."
"However, there are numerous other 
regulatory schemes in practically all jurisdictions worldwide to which we are subject."
"Risks could also arise from effects of 
regulations in the area of product-related environmental protection including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) 
and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and other sustainability regulations."
"We need to 
comply with and safeguard requirements that will ensure product safety and regulatory market access."
"To counter the risks 
mentioned above, we monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas 
with the objective of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions."
"Furthermore, we issue 
internal regulations and guidance, conduct continuous training and communication as well as synchronized implementation 
actions."
"In addition, internal and external audits of compliance with laws and regulations are performed."
"Compliance with Laws 
In connection with our global business activities, we must ensure compliance with antitrust and competition law, anti-corruption 
legislation, data protection regulations and other laws."
"We have established compliance and risk management systems to ensure 
compliance with requirements."
"Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that these systems will enable us to avoid all risks in every 
jurisdiction."
"There are risks, for example, regarding data privacy violations in the processing of personal data of our employees, 
customers, patients, or other business partners."
"Moreover, in our business environment, there are risks regarding antitrust or 
corruption law violations and other violations of law."
"Consequences of violations of the law could under certain circumstances 
also affect us if they relate to violations by our indirect sales channels or business partners."
"In addition, a significant portion of 
our business involves governments and companies with public shareholders."
"We are also involved in various projects funded by 
government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations."
"This may pose risks from a compliance 
perspective."
"Furthermore, we may face compliance risks in connection with acquired companies that are still in the integration 
process."
"There could also be risks related to violations of other laws and legislation such as export control and embargo 
regulations and intellectual property rights."
"All these risks could result in violations of law with severe consequences and can 
have a negative impact on our business, net assets, financial position, and results of operations."
"They could also result in claims 
for damages, fines or penalties, the exclusion of direct or indirect participation in certain types of transactions and public tenders, 
and reputational damage."
"Consequently, we are constantly countering these risks with targeted measures."
"The foundation for 
our governance framework is provided by our globally applicable directives."
"In addition to measures such as general compliance 
training, our Antitrust Compliance Program, requirements of our Business Conduct Guidelines and Data Protection Program, we 
have established a global compliance organization."
"This organization conducts, among other things, audits to identify 
compliance risks at an early stage."
"Moreover, by providing whistleblower hotlines and establishing internal and external points of 
contact, we enable the timely reporting of potential deficiencies or violations to us, authorities or other stakeholders as 
appropriate."
"With regard to our business partners, we have established a global business partner management system."
"This 
includes, among other measures, a careful selection process, a structured onboarding process as well as training, monitoring and 
a close exchange during our visits to the customer's site as well as regular audits with consistent implementation and monitoring 
of measures taken."
"To meet the legal and internal requirements for data protection, we have implemented an information 
security and data protection management system whose mechanisms meet the high requirements of the ISO 27001 standard 
extended by 27701, under which we are certified."
"Assessment of the overall risk situation 
The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories above – strategic, operational, financial and compliance 
risks – reflects the current assessment of the relative risk exposure."
"The most significant risks we are currently exposed to are 
 Economic, Political and Geopolitical Developments,  Cybersecurity and  Regulatory Environment."
"As in the prior year and already 
described in the half-year financial report  Economic, Political and Geopolitical Developments constitutes the most significant risk."
We consider all other risks mentioned above not as high as the three most significant risks.
"At present, no risks have been 
identified that in their known form either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going 
concern."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Combined management report  –  Report on material risks and opportunities 
 
38 
A.6.3 Opportunities 
Below we describe our significant opportunities."
"Unless indicated otherwise, the opportunities described below relate to all our 
segments."
"Efficiency Gains 
Our comprehensive approach to our internal digital transformation and related investments could potentially support our 
growth, improve our cost position and increase our attractiveness as employer."
"The leverage of our digital skills, infrastructure, 
tools and data could enable us to achieve a significant increase in our economic performance across the entire value chain of the 
company."
"Further investments into efficiency measures, and the use of new technologies such as machine learning, digital twins 
and artificial intelligence, could potentially drive additional improvements in our processes and cost structures."
"Increased 
harmonization, collaboration and transparency throughout the entire organization could create synergies, lead to faster decision-
making processes and reduce redundant efforts."
"In supply chain management and product lifecycle management, opportunities 
for improvement could arise from further implementing an integrated digital tool landscape."
"Improvements could also include 
further efficiency gains from using standardized platform elements across multiple applications."
"Utilizing these synergies could 
further increase our flexibility and speed in adjusting our innovative solution portfolio to the needs of the market while 
optimizing product lifecycle costs and reducing internal complexity."
"The evaluation of certain internal processes and systems can 
help us to identify potential for productivity and operational excellence."
"We realize this potential by consolidating and reducing 
the complexity of existing processes and by streamlining and modernizing them."
"Growth Fields 
Innovation, digital offerings and new business models form the core of our company in shaping the future of the healthcare 
industry."
We invest significantly in research and development in order to develop innovative offerings for our customers.
"In doing 
so, we aim at the same time to safeguard our competitiveness."
"Our goal is to enable healthcare providers to create added value 
by expanding precision medicine, transforming care delivery and improving patient experience by leveraging digital 
technologies."
We expect to be able to meet future demands arising from fundamental trends.
"These trends include demographic 
change and global population growth as well as the increasing burden of chronic diseases."
"In addition, the provision of funds by 
aid organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the EU as well as the provision of national funds, for example 
in the form of subsidies, could further increase."
"This could expand investment and spending in hospitals, for example in the 
Middle East and Africa, Asia and Europe."
"This in turn could generate additional growth in these markets, especially for standard 
and basic products and services."
"Moreover, we aim to expand our business through sales growth programs."
"Higher 
reimbursement for innovative products might allow us to leverage additional sales opportunities."
"Greater sales coverage and 
improved identification of unserved or underserved market opportunities can help us win larger deals as well as prolonged 
contracts which can generate additional revenue."
"Furthermore, we see the opportunity to generate additional sales volume and 
profit from new and innovative digital products, services and solutions, including additional cybersecurity for our customers, 
preventive maintenance and data analytics."
"Furthermore, additional business opportunities could also arise from long-term value 
partnerships with healthcare providers, supporting our customers in setting up centers of excellence and jointly co-creating on 
solutions."
"We continuously strive to grow and expand our business in established markets, open up new markets for existing 
portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in order to gain a higher market share and improved profitability."
"In 
addition, we aim to further develop our product portfolio and also expand into adjacent fields, especially in high-growth 
customer segments."
"This is achieved through various measures, such as targeted product development (for example entry-level 
systems), the expansion of our consulting competencies to strengthen our position as a trusted partner, the assessment of new 
market entry strategies, and M&A activities."
"We also tackle opportunities to contribute the know-how and technology of our 
company and its employees in adjacent areas for the benefit of patients and healthcare providers and thus generate additional 
business growth."
"Assessment of the overall opportunity situation 
The order in which they are presented reflects the current assessment of the relative exposure for Siemens Healthineers 
associated with these opportunities."
The described opportunities are not necessarily the only ones we encounter.
"In addition, our 
assessment of opportunities is subject to change, as Siemens Healthineers, our markets and technologies are constantly 
developing."
It is also possible that opportunities we foresee today will never materialize.
"Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business goals, the 
correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting, and compliance with the laws and regulations relevant to Siemens 
Healthineers."
Sustainability aspects are covered as well and are continuously developed based on the regulatory requirements.
"Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally accepted COSO framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission)."
"Our ERM approach is based on the COSO Standard “Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and 
Performance” (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018), and is adapted to 
Siemens Healthineers requirements."
"Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” 
(2013) also developed by COSO."
"The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS."
"The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our 
ICS, both systems are complementary."
All Siemens Healthineers entities are part of our ICS and ERM.
"The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different, 
depending, among others, on the entity’s impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the specific risks associated with 
the entity."
"The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of 
responsibility, based on the group-wide mandatory methodology."
Overall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board.
"It consists of the central RIC departments and those responsible in the businesses, regions and functions."
"The central RIC 
departments are responsible for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective 
ICS and ERM within the Group."
"We also have an overarching, integrated ICS and ERM methodology (RIC methodology) with a standardized procedure under 
which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their adequacy 
and effectiveness."
"For more information on ERM, see chapter  A.6.1 Risk management."
Our ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject to audit activities by our internal audit function.
"These are 
carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request."
"At the end of each fiscal year, our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM."
This evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens Healthineers “In Control” Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings.
"The information 
contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthineers AG to report on 
the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM."
"The Siemens Healthineers “In Control” Statement is supported by certifications at various 
corporate levels and by all affiliated companies."
"In the quarterly Managing Board meetings, the company-wide risk and 
opportunity situation is evaluated, the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion 
is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS and ERM."
"Based on this, the Managing Board has no indication that our 
ICS or ERM in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30, 2023."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system."
"For example, and 
no system, – even if deemed to be adequate and effective – can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified 
in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances."
The Audit Committee is systematically integrated into our control system.
"In particular, it oversees the accounting and 
accounting process and the effectiveness of the ICM and ERM and the internal audit system."
"Furthermore, we have set up a 
disclosure committee which is responsible for reviewing certain financial and nonfinancial information prior to publication."
"The integration of Varian into our ICS, which began in fiscal year 2021 after the acquisition, continued in fiscal year 2023 and 
was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities."
"The integration measures are planned to be completely 
finalized in fiscal year 2024."

A.6.4.2 Compliance Management System  
The ICS and ERM are supplemented by a Compliance Management System (CMS) geared to the company's risk situation."
"Our 
CMS is based on three pillars: prevent, detect and respond and includes the legal risk areas of corruption, antitrust law, data 
protection, money laundering, export controls and respect for human rights."
"It is based on an extensive internal set of rules: The 
Siemens Healthineers Business Conduct Guidelines (“BCG”) define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be 
observed by all employees in the company units and in relation to customers, external partners and the public."
"In addition, there 
are extensive internal compliance regulations, including associated controls, which oblige all Siemens Healthineers employees to 
ensure the implementation of the CMS."
"They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with 
regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information."
"The compliance operating model 
contains binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS 
works."
"Compliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and 
to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks."
"The risk assessment is also integrated into individual 
business processes and tools in order to initiate appropriate risk minimization measures."
"The results of compliance risk 
management that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the company-wide ERM."
The Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide.
"It is 
part of the ICS and is continuously being further developed and adapted to the current Siemens Healthineers guidelines."
"In 
addition, current compliance issues are discussed at management level on a regular basis."
The entire CMS is continually adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements.
"The findings from 
compliance risk management and compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for further development of the 
CMS."
"Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally recognized COSO framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission), for further information see  A.6.4.1 Internal Control and Risk Management System."
"At the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS."
"Siemens Healthineers has a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with 
uniform standards, and tested regularly for their effectiveness."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness 
of any control system, and no control system, including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements."
"Our Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS are prepared on the basis of a centrally provided conceptual framework 
which primarily consists of uniform financial reporting guidelines and a chart of accounts."
"They are issued centrally by the 
Siemens Group and complemented by additional Siemens Healthineers guidelines for business-specific financial reporting topics."
"Siemens Healthineers AG and other entities within Siemens Healthineers are required to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with the German Commercial Code; the conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific 
to the German Commercial Code."
"The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed 
on an ongoing basis."
"Accounting departments are informed regularly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and 
closing process perspective."
"The base data used in preparing our financial statements consist of the closing data reported by Siemens Healthineers AG and its 
subsidiaries."
Governance and monitoring activities relating to accounting activities are usually bundled on a regional level.
"In

A.7 Siemens Healthineers AG 
The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers AG were prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German 
Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch”)."
"Siemens Healthineers AG is the parent company of Siemens Healthineers, acts as a management holding company, and provides 
administration and intercompany financing services."
"Its results are significantly influenced by directly or indirectly owned 
subsidiaries."
"As a result, the business development of Siemens Healthineers AG is generally subject to the same risks and 
opportunities as the Group."
"Due to the interrelations between Siemens Healthineers AG and its subsidiaries, the outlook of the 
Group also reflects our expectations for Siemens Healthineers AG."
"For this reason, the above comments for Siemens Healthineers 
also apply to Siemens Healthineers AG."
"In addition, Siemens Healthineers AG is exposed to the risk of impairment of equity 
investments in subsidiaries."
"The impairment test for investments in subsidiaries is generally based on a discounted cash flow 
model."
The results of the test are influenced by the development and success of the subsidiaries and their investments.
"Consequently, adverse effects on subsidiaries or indirect investments may lead to an impairment of the investment in 
subsidiaries in Siemens Healthineers AG’s Annual Financial Statements."
"Impairments would reduce the net income that can be 
distributed to owners."
"As investments in subsidiaries represent around 90% of total assets, which is a significant proportion, this 
risk is of great importance for Siemens Healthineers AG."
"Income from equity investments significantly influences the net income 
of Siemens Healthineers AG."
Further optimization of the financing structure and corporate legal structure were focal points of the activities in fiscal year 2023.
"On October 1, 2022, Siemens Healthineers AG acquired assets and liabilities of the intragroup in-house bank in Siemens 
Healthcare GmbH for a negative purchase price of €1.4 million on the basis of an agreement concluded with Siemens Healthcare 
GmbH, Munich, on August 11, 2022."
The purchase price reflected the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities.
"At the 
transfer date, these assets and liabilities comprised more than 100 clearing accounts, all intercompany loans and investments, 
and the two multicurrency revolving credit facilities with Siemens AG in the amount of €2,100 million."
"This transaction increased 
the total assets of Siemens Healthineers AG by €2,658 million."
"In November 2022, a domination and profit transfer agreement was concluded with Siemens Healthineers Holding I GmbH, 
Munich, for an indefinite term of effect."
"This agreement took effect upon being entered in the Commercial Register on March 9, 
2023."
"In March 2023, by way of transfer of contract, Siemens Healthineers AG took over all the rights and obligations of a promissory 
note loan in the amount of US$1,645 million from previous holder Siemens Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co."
"The loan, which has a term until September 2024, was issued by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Los Angeles, 
United States."
"In addition, Siemens Healthineers AG took over the forward exchange contracts concluded between Siemens 
Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co."
KG and Siemens AG to hedge the foreign currency risks arising from the acquired loan.
These forward exchange contracts had a negative market value in the amount of €131 million.
"Because the fair value of the loan 
at the transfer date exceeded the settlement amount, an item of deferred income was recognized in the amount of €2 million."
"The cumulative fair value of the acquired loan and the corresponding forward exchange contracts was recognized as the 
acquisition cost of shares in Siemens Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co."
"KG in the amount of €1,646 million."
"Siemens Healthineers AG and Siemens Healthcare GmbH entered into a spin-off and transfer agreement on August 18, 2023."
"According to this agreement, Siemens Healthcare GmbH transfers almost all its assets and liabilities to Siemens Healthineers AG."
The objective of the spin-off is to simplify the corporate governance structure of Siemens Healthineers Group.
"In particular, this 
will also create the requirements for the formation of a Supervisory Board with equal representation at the level of Siemens 
Healthineers AG."
"The transfer of the assets to be spun off take effect on October 1, 2023 if the spin-off is to be entered in the 
Commercial Register by January 31, 2024."
"If the entry is not done by January 31, 2024, the spin-off date will be postponed to 
October 1, 2024."
"It is expected that this transaction will have the effect of increasing the total assets of Siemens Healthineers AG 
by an amount in the mid-single digit billions of euros."
"In addition, this transaction will have the effect of shifting most income 
from equity investments under the profit/loss transfer agreement in effect with Siemens Healthcare GmbH to the operating 
result, so that it will be presented in the income statement from the date of recognition."
"From that date, cash inflows and 
outflows from operating activities will be recognized immediately in the financial statements of Siemens Healthineers AG, 
whereas currently the cash inflow from the profit transfer agreement is recognized only after a delay."
"The developments explained in chapters  A.3.1 Market development and  A.3.2 Results of operations were mainly indirect in that 
they influenced the business activities of Siemens Healthineers AG’s direct and indirect subsidiaries."
"Siemens Healthineers AG

was directly affected in particular by the increase in key interest rates by central banks to combat higher inflation and the 
associated higher borrowing costs."

This corresponds to a dividend per share of €0.95.
"As of September 30, 2023, Siemens Healthineers AG had 56 employees."
"The decline of €318 million in financial income/expenses, net resulted mainly from a lower net interest income/expenses and 
income from equity investments."
"Net interest income/expenses declined by €82 million due to the transfer of assets and liabilities of the intragroup in-house bank 
to Siemens Healthineers AG."
"Interest expenses on variable-rate loans increased by €36 million in fiscal 2023 due to higher 
interest rates."
"A further increase of €30 million resulted from a loan in the amount of €850 million which was extended end of 
fiscal year 2022 with a new contractual interest rate of 3.6%."
"Interest expenses amounted to €29 million due to the takeover of a 
loan from Siemens Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co."
"KG, whereby the pro rata realization of the forward components of 
the foreign currency derivatives was taken into account to reduce expenses."
"Moreover, the income from equity investments declined by €135 million."
"The profit transfer of Siemens Healthcare GmbH fell by 
€285 million to €1,360 million."
"Income taxes included only current income taxes from corporation tax and trade tax because the excess of deferred tax assets 
was not recognized due to the exercise of the option under Section 274 para."
1 sentence 2 German Commercial Code.
"The 
income tax expenses were related to the income tax group of Siemens Healthineers AG and declined by €316 million, mainly due 
to the decrease in income from business activity and higher tax-free income from equity investments compared to the prior year."
KG by way of transfer of contract.
"These operations had the net effect of increasing the carrying amount of the equity 
investment by €1,646 million."
"Current assets 
The €2,690 million increase in receivables and other assets resulted particularly from the transfer of assets of the intragroup in-
house bank to Siemens Healthineers AG."
"The resulting, newly added receivables from affiliated companies in the amount of 
€2,409 million consisted of receivables from cash pooling and loans granted, including interest receivables."
"As in the prior year, intercompany short-term loans in Chinese yuan (CN¥) in the amount of €453 million (September 30, 2022: 
€288 million) taken out at Siemens Healthineers Ltd., Shanghai, China, were forwarded as short-term investments at Siemens AG 
(2022: at Siemens Healthcare GmbH)."
"As of the reporting date, receivables were owed by Siemens Healthineers Holding I GmbH, Munich, in the amount of 
€185 million from the domination and profit transfer agreement concluded in fiscal year 2023."
"In a countervailing development, 
profit transfer receivables from Siemens Healthcare GmbH declined by €285 million to €1,360 million."
"An income tax asset of €166 million was recognized as of September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022: tax provision of 
€231 million)."
"This development resulted from the advance payments for the current financial year and the utilization of the 
provisions recognized for prior years."
"In addition, receivables from the tax authorities under the value-added tax group declined by €10 million to €152 million."

Shareholders’ equity 
The €85 million decrease in equity is the result of offsetting developments."
"The dividend distributed for fiscal year 2022 reduced 
unappropriated net income by €1,066 million."
"This effect was more than offset by the net income in the amount of €1,172 
million."
"In fiscal year 2023, the issuance of treasury shares under share-based payments and employee share programs led to a 
€222 million increase in the capital reserve."
"An amount of €9 million was withdrawn from the freely distributable capital reserve 
pursuant to Section 272 (2) no."
"4 German Commercial Code in fiscal year for the buyback of treasury shares, which consisted of

The equity ratio decreased from 55% to 48%.
"The main reason for this was the increase in liabilities due to the transfer of 
liabilities of the intragroup in-house bank to Siemens Healthineers AG and the takeover of a loan from Siemens Healthineers 
Beteiligungen GmbH & Co."
KG while the amount of equity remained nearly unchanged.
"Liabilities

"Changes in estimates and assumptions are 
recognized in the period in which the changes occur and in future periods impacted by the changes."
"The COVID-19 pandemic and associated significant uncertainties have been considered, where relevant, in accounting estimates 
and judgments."
"In fiscal year 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic did not lead to material adjustments to the carrying amounts of 
recognized assets and liabilities."
"In connection with the war in Ukraine, there were no material adjustments to the carrying amounts of the recognized assets and 
liabilities in fiscal year 2023."
Siemens Healthineers has no production sites in Ukraine or Russia.
"The business activities of the 
sales and service units could be negatively impacted by further escalation of the war in Ukraine, possible further sanctions, the 
escalating conflict in the Middle East and the exchange rate development for the respective local currencies."
"The associated risks 
are monitored on an ongoing basis."
"For further information on impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, on disaggregation of revenue and on segment information, 
please see disclosures in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report."

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Siemens Healthineers AG and the subsidiaries over which control is 
exercised."
"Siemens Healthineers AG controls an investee if it has direct or indirect power over the investee, exposure or rights to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of 
the investor’s returns."
"Business combinations 
The costs of an acquisition are measured at the fair value of the assets given and the liabilities incurred or assumed at the 
acquisition date."
"Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests."
"Non-
controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill 
method)."
The non-controlling interests participate in comprehensive income.
"Transactions resulting in changes in the proportion of equity 
held by non-controlling interests that do not result in the loss of control by the Group are accounted for as equity transactions 
not affecting profit or loss."
"At the date control is lost, the entity concerned is deconsolidated and any remaining equity interests 
of the Group are remeasured to fair value through profit or loss."
"As a writer of a put option on non-controlling interests, Siemens Healthineers assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer 
of present ownership interests are fulfilled at the balance sheet date."
"The 
non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period."
"Foreign currency translation 
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot 
exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while income and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange 
rates."
"Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to profit or loss when the gain or 
loss on disposal of the foreign operation is recognized."
"The items within the consolidated statements of cash flows are translated 
at monthly average exchange rates, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the 
reporting period."
"Hyperinflationary accounting 
Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, are 
adjusted to reflect changes in general purchasing power."
"In such instances, all items which are recognized on the statements of 
financial position and the statements of income are translated using the exchange rate at closing."
"Each non-monetary item on 
the statements of financial position, which is carried at cost or amortized cost and each transaction in the statements of income 
are restated by applying a general price index from the date of acquisition or initial incurrence of these items."
"The cumulative effects of the indexation of non-monetary items on the statements of financial position 
are recognized as retained earnings the first time that the rules for hyperinflationary accounting are applied."
"In subsequent 
periods the effects are recognized in the line item other financial income, net in the consolidated statements of income."
"Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity are recorded, on initial recognition, in that functional 
currency, by applying the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction."
"At the end of each reporting period, foreign 
currency-denominated monetary items are translated applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date."
"Gains and losses 
arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in profit or loss."
"Foreign currency-denominated non-monetary 
items are subsequently translated using the historical spot exchange rate."

Consolidated financial statements  –  Notes to consolidated financial statements

Revenue recognition 
Siemens Healthineers recognizes revenue when, or as, control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer."
"This 
requires, among others, that a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists, the customer is committed to its 
contractual obligations, and collectability of consideration is probable, taking the customer’s creditworthiness into account."
Revenue is the transaction price Siemens Healthineers expects to be entitled to.
"Variable consideration is included in the 
transaction price if it is highly probable that no significant reversal of revenue will occur once associated uncertainties are 
resolved."
"Accounting estimates are involved in determining the amount of variable consideration, which is calculated by using 
either the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable 
consideration."
"Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and 
the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit to either the customer or Siemens 
Healthineers."
"If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated to each performance 
obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices."
"If stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable, Siemens 
Healthineers reasonably estimates them, primarily by using historical reference values."
"Revenue is recognized for each 
performance obligation either at a point in time or over time."
"Revenue from the sale of goods: Revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods (especially equipment, 
reagents and consumables) passes to the customer, usually upon delivery of the goods."
"Payment terms typically do not exceed 
90 days after customer acceptance."
"Revenue from services: Revenue is recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than 
straight-line, as services are provided."
"Service contracts can also include extended warranties, which cover periods beyond the 
statutory or customary warranty period and for which revenue is recognized straight-line over the extended warranty period."
Customer payments are typically received on a monthly or quarterly basis over the contract term.
"Revenue from construction-type contracts: Revenue is recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on 
the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs."
"An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an 
expense immediately."
"Within contracts, customer payments are agreed on the basis of quantified performance indicators or the 
achievement of specific events or milestones, usually due no later than 90 days after invoicing."
"The percentage-of-completion 
method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve 
estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations."
"Estimates include total 
estimated costs, total estimated revenues, and contract risks including technical, political and regulatory risks."
"Under the 
percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue for the period."
"In 
addition, it is necessary to assess whether the most likely scenario for a contract is its continuation or its termination."
"For this 
assessment, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis."
"Contract assets primarily relate to the sale of goods for which 
transfer of control to the customer occurs before Siemens Healthineers has an unconditional right to consideration."
"Contract 
liabilities result mainly from customer advances on services and from prepayments for goods not yet shipped."
"Contract assets 
and contract liabilities are presented net at the contract level and as current because they arise in the course of the regular 
operating cycle."
Receivables are recognized when the right to receive the consideration becomes unconditional.
"Valuation 
allowances for credit risks are set up for contract assets and receivables according to the accounting policy for financial assets 
measured at amortized cost."
"Functional costs 
In general, operating expenses by types are assigned to functional areas according to their profit and cost centers."
"Amortization, 
depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are included in functional costs depending 
on the use of the assets."
"Research and development expenses 
Expenditures on research activities and collaborations are recognized immediately as expenses."
"Expenditures on development 
activities are expensed and capitalized only when the recognition criteria in IAS 38, Intangible Assets, are met."
"To assess the 
fulfillment of these criteria, assumptions must be made about technical development risks and market developments, among 
other factors."
"Capitalized development expenses are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, 
with an amortization period of generally three to 25 years."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Consolidated financial statements  –  Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 
61 
Income taxes 
Recognition and measurement of tax positions are determined according to respective local tax laws and applicable tax 
authorities’ regulations."
These can be complex and may be interpreted differently by taxpayers and local tax authorities.
"Thus, 
subsequent current tax payments or refunds for prior years are possible."
"These uncertainties are taken into account based on the 
judgement of management."
"Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient taxable 
profit is projected for the periods in which the underlying temporary difference is reversed."
"The projection includes, in particular, 
future results from operating activities, reversals of taxable temporary differences and substantiated tax planning opportunities."
"At each reporting date, Siemens Healthineers reassesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the projected taxable 
profit."
"Because future business developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens Healthineers’ control, assumptions are 
necessary to estimate future taxable profit as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will be recovered."
"Estimates are 
updated on a regular basis and resulting adjustments are made in the respective period."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and there is a legal right to set off current tax assets against 
liabilities."
"Tax consequences arising from the prospective application of the global minimum taxation (Pillar Two) are not 
considered for the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities."
"Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to the shareholders of Siemens Healthineers AG by 
the weighted average number of shares of Siemens Healthineers AG outstanding during fiscal year."
"Diluted earnings per share 
are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive share-based payment plans."
"Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value."
"Acquisition or production costs are 
generally determined on the basis of an average value or the first-in, first-out method."
"The determination of the net realizable 
value includes assumptions with respect to quantity risks, risks of technical obsolescence and price risks."
"Goodwill 
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses."
"At Siemens Healthineers, the goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of the segments (please 
also see  Note 30  
Segment information)."
The allocation of goodwill requires judgment.
"Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and also whenever an indication arises (triggering event) that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable."
Siemens Healthineers performs the annual impairment test in the quarter ending September 30.
"For the 
purpose of impairment testing, the segment’s recoverable amount is to be determined as the higher of the segment’s fair value 
less costs of disposal and its value in use."
"If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not necessary to determine 
both values."
"If the carrying amount of the segment to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, an 
impairment loss on goodwill allocated to this segment is recognized."
"Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future 
periods."
The segment’s recoverable amount is based on discounted cash flow calculations and involves the use of accounting estimates.
"The amount is influenced by, for example, the market launch of new goods and services, the successful integration of 
acquisitions, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic 
trends."
"At Siemens Healthineers, the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the fair value less costs of disposal."
"Cash flows after the detailed planning period are extrapolated using 
individual growth rates."
The determined fair value of a segment is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
"Key assumptions 
for determining fair value less costs of disposal include estimated terminal value growth rates and discount rates, in addition to 
the assumptions relevant for determining the cash flows in the detailed planning period."
"Both assumptions are determined 
individually for each segment."
"The discount rates correspond to the segment’s weighted average cost of capital and are 
calculated based on a risk-free interest rate and a market risk premium."
The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information.
"The peer groups 
undergo an annual review and are adjusted, if necessary."
"Terminal value growth rates consider external macroeconomic data 
and industry-specific trends."
"The accounting estimates, including the methodology applied, can have a material impact on the 
respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment."
"Additionally, the outcome of goodwill impairment tests 
may depend on the allocation of goodwill to the segments."
"Other intangible assets 
Siemens Healthineers amortizes purchased intangible assets with a finite useful life on a straight-line basis over their respective 
estimated useful lives."
"The estimated useful life of purchased patents, licenses and similar rights generally ranges from three to 
14 years."
"Self-developed intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective 
estimated useful lives, which range from three to 25 years."
"In addition, there are intangible assets acquired in business 
combinations, especially customer relationships, trademarks, technologies, and order backlog."
Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis.
"In addition, intangible assets not yet 
available for use are subject to an annual impairment test."
"If the recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be 
determined, the impairment test is performed at the level of the cash-generating unit."
"A cash-generating unit is the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that includes the asset to be tested for impairment and that generates cash inflows, which are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets."
"When determining the relevant cash-generating unit, 
various factors need to be considered, including how management monitors operations or makes decisions about continuing or 
disposing of assets and operations."
"Therefore, the identification of the relevant cash-generating unit involves judgment."
"In 
addition, impairment testing of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment involves the use of accounting 
estimates in determining the recoverable amount of the assets or cash-generating units."
"These estimates can have a material 
impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment."
"For further information on leases, please refer to  Note 7  
Trade and other receivables,

Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,  Note 16  
Financial debt,  Note 25  
Other financial obligations and 
 Note 27  
Financial risk management."
Siemens Healthineers as lessor rents equipment to its customers.
"If substantially all risks and rewards incidental to the ownership 
of the rented equipment are transferred to the customer, the lease is classified as a finance lease, otherwise as an operating 
lease."
"Under finance leases, revenue is recognized at the time the equipment is made available for use by the customer."
"At the 
same time, a receivable from finance leases is recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease."
"In the following 
periods, interest income is realized using the effective interest method, reflecting a constant periodic rate of return of the net 
investment."
"Under operating leases, the rented equipment is recognized as property, plant and equipment and is depreciated on 
a straight-line basis over its useful life."
"Income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective 
lease term."
"Siemens Healthineers as lessee applies the right-of-use model, means right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized, 
which normally correspond to the discounted lease payments at initial measurement."
"The right-of-use model is not applied for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less or for low-value assets."
"In these cases, the lease payments are instead expensed over 
the lease term."
Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain.
"The accounting policy 
choice for the non-separation of lease components and non-lease components is used, with the exemption for vehicle leases, 
and all components are accounted for as lease components."
"Right-of-use assets are measured at acquisition costs less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of the 
lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset."
"Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments 
payable over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate."
"Subsequently, they are measured using 
the effective interest method."
"Lease liabilities are remeasured in case of lease modifications (due to renegotiations) or index-
changes triggering price-adjustments, and as a result of required reassessments of existing contract conditions."
"The 
remeasurement of the lease liabilities leads to a respective adjustment of the right-of-use assets."
"If the effect is material, 
provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax interest rate that 
corresponds to the risk-free market interest rate."
Discretionary assessment is required to determine provisions.
"In particular, the determination of provisions related to asset 
retirement obligations, as well as provisions related to legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations 
(hereinafter, collectively, “legal proceedings”) requires significant accounting estimates."
"Siemens Healthineers recognizes a 
provision for onerous contracts with customers when the estimated unavoidable costs of outstanding goods and services exceed 
the expected outstanding revenue."
"Legal proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial 
uncertainties."
"Internal and external counsels are generally part of the 
determination process for legal proceedings."
"Due to new developments, it may be necessary to recognize a provision for an 
ongoing legal proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision."
"Upon resolution of a legal proceeding, 
Siemens Healthineers may incur charges in excess of the provision recognized for the matter concerned."
"Legal proceedings may 
have a material effect on net assets, financial position and results of operations."
"Defined benefit plans 
Siemens Healthineers measures entitlements from defined benefit plans by applying the projected unit credit method."
"Thereby, 
the obligation from defined benefit plans reflects an actuarially calculated present value of the future entitlement for services 
already rendered (defined benefit obligation, DBO)."
"Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, 
expected compensation increases and pension progression and mortality rates."
"Discount rates used are determined by reference 
to yields on high-quality corporate bonds (corporate bonds with very low risk of default) of appropriate duration and currency at 
the end of the reporting period."
"In such case that yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bond yields."
"For significant plans, individual spot rates from a full yield curve approach are applied in general."
"Due to changing market, 
economic and social conditions, the underlying actuarial assumptions may differ from actual developments."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Consolidated financial statements  –  Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 
64 
For funded plans, Siemens Healthineers offsets the fair value of the plan assets with the defined benefit obligation."
"The net 
amount is presented, after adjustments for any effects relating to asset ceiling."
"Current and past service cost, settlement gains and losses for pensions and similar obligations and administration costs unrelated 
to the management of plan assets are allocated to functional costs."
"Thereby, past service cost and settlement gains and losses 
are recognized immediately in net income."
"Current service cost and interest income and expenses are determined based on the 
assumptions used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation as of the reporting date of the prior fiscal year, and 
recognized in profit or loss."
"Net interest is thus calculated by multiplying the discount rate for the respective fiscal year by the net 
defined benefit asset or liability from defined benefit plans as of the reporting date of the prior fiscal year."
"As of the reporting 
date, remeasurements are recognized in other comprehensive income."
"These comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the 
difference between the return on plan assets and the interest income on plan assets, which is included in net interest."
"Entitlements resulting from plans based on investment returns of underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of 
the underlying assets as of the reporting date."
"If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the 
DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value."
"Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are provided when Siemens Healthineers either offers an employee the option to voluntarily resign from 
employment before the normal retirement date or decides to terminate the employment."
"Termination benefits in accordance 
with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, are recognized as liabilities and expenses when the offer of those benefits can no longer be 
withdrawn."
"Financial instruments 
Initially, financial instruments are generally recognized at their fair value."
"Receivables from finance leases are measured at an 
amount equal to the net investment in the lease."
"Regular-way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade 
date."
"For some debt instruments, the assessment of 
the contractual cash flows may involve judgment."
"Equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless the 
option to measure them at fair value through other comprehensive income was elected."
"Derivatives are measured at fair value 
through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedging instruments."
"Financial liabilities measured at fair value through 
profit or loss include contingent consideration recognized in a business combination."
"Siemens Healthineers does not use the 
option to designate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition (fair value 
option)."
"Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: Siemens Healthineers irrevocably elected to present 
changes in the fair value of its investment in Medical Systems S.p.A."
in other comprehensive income to avoid earnings volatility.
"Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the investment are recognized in 
other comprehensive income."
"Financial assets measured at amortized cost: Loans, receivables and other debt instruments held in a hold-to-collect business 
model, and whose contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortized cost."
Interest income is calculated using the effective interest method.
"Valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses, representing a forward-looking estimate of future credit losses and 
involving significant judgment."
"Expected credit losses are calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset 
less collateral, multiplied by a factor reflecting the probability of default and the loss in the event of default."
"Probabilities of 
default and losses in the event of default are derived mainly from rating grades determined by Siemens Financial Services."
"Valuation allowances for receivables from Siemens Group are measured according to the general three-stage impairment 
approach."
"For trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets, Siemens Healthineers uses the simplified impairment 
model to measure valuation allowances at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses."
Financial assets are considered in default if the obligor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations.
"A range of internally 
defined events can trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings or a default rating by an external 
rating agency."
Financial assets are written off as uncollectible when it appears unlikely that they will be recovered.
"Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost: Siemens Healthineers measures financial liabilities, except for derivatives, 
contingent consideration recognized in a business combination, and written put options on non-controlling interests, at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method."
Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.
"Siemens Healthineers considers as cash equivalents 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition."
"Short-term deposits and 
overdraft facilities granted in connection with the cash pooling arrangements with the Siemens Group are not included in cash 
and cash equivalents."
Changes in these items are presented as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
"Cash flow hedges: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments in cash flow 
hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income."
"Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve are reclassified into 
net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income."
"For certain time-period-related cash flow hedges, 
Siemens Healthineers designates only the change in the fair value of the spot element of forward exchange contracts as a 
hedging instrument."
"Changes in the fair value of the forward element are recognized in other comprehensive income and are 
accumulated separately in a cost of hedging reserve."
"The value of the forward element at the time of designation is amortized 
into profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the hedging period."
"Share-based payment 
Share-based payment awards may be settled in shares of Siemens Healthineers AG or Siemens AG, depending on which shares 
are the basis, or in cash."
"Share-based payment awards based on Siemens Healthineers AG shares are classified predominately as 
equity-settled."
"Share-based payment awards based on Siemens AG shares are classified as cash-settled to fulfill the specific 
requirements for share-based payment transactions among group entities, because Siemens Healthineers AG is controlled by 
Siemens AG."
"The fair value of equity instruments for equity-settled plans and of liabilities for cash-settled plans is measured at the grant date 
and recognized as an expense over the vesting period."
"For cash-settled plans, the fair value is reassessed each quarter."
"The fair 
value is based on the market price of Siemens Healthineers AG shares or Siemens AG shares considering the present value of 
dividends to which the beneficiaries are not entitled during the vesting period as well as market and non-vesting conditions, if 
applicable."
"Therefore, the fair value is based on market parameters, assumptions and estimates."
"Changes in any of these could 
necessitate material adjustments to the carrying amount of the liabilities."
"Prior-year information 
Certain prior-year information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation."
"Recent accounting pronouncements, not yet adopted 
The IASB has issued standards and amendments to standards whose application is not yet mandatory and which in part are not 
endorsed by the EU."
"Siemens Healthineers currently assumes that the application of these standards and amendments will not 
have a material impact on the presentation of the consolidat 
ed financial statements."

"For further information, please refer to  Note 13 
 
Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment."
"Deferred taxes included 
income of €239 million (2022: €428 million) from the origination and reversal of temporary differences."
"In fiscal year 2023, the calculation of taxes in Germany was based on a combined tax rate of 29.5% (2022: 29.5%), consisting of 
the corporate tax rate of 15.0% (2022: 15.0%), the solidarity surcharge thereon of 5.5% (2022: 5.5%) and an average trade tax 
rate of 13.7% (2022: 13.7%)."
"For foreign subsidiaries, taxes were calculated based on local tax law and applicable tax rates in the 
individual countries."
"As of September 30, 2023, deferred tax liabilities of €45 million (September 30, 2022: €20 million) 
were recognized for planned dividend payments."
"Uncertainties in the interpretation of a tax regulation in the context of an enacted foreign tax reform in former years may result 
in future tax payments of a mid double-digit million amount."
"Due to the low probability of such an occurrence, no current 
income tax liability was recognized."
"Siemens Healthineers assumes application of the global minimum taxation (Pillar Two) from fiscal year 2025 and expects current

"The 
corresponding long-term portion is reported in the line item other non-current financial assets and amounted to €287 million as 
of the reporting date (September 30, 2022: €255 million)."
"For further details, please refer to  Note 16  
Financial debt and to  Note 26  
Financial 
instruments and hedging activities."
"Note 9  Contract assets 
As of the reporting date, contract assets amounted to €1,629 million (September 30, 2022: €1,412 million; October 1, 2021: 
€1,116 million)."
"Thereof, contract assets amounting to €276 million (September 30, 2022: €297 million) had a remaining term 
of more than twelve months."
Write-offs of inventories decreased by €44 million (2022: increase by €111 million) compared to the prior year.
"Revenue figures in the five-year detailed planning period for the Imaging, Diagnostics and Advanced Therapies segments 
included average revenue growth rates (excluding portfolio effects) of 3.6% to 7.3% (2022: -0.2% to 8.6%)."
"The steady state of 
Varian will be achieved at a later date in line with the expected disproportionate growth due to an expected increase in new 
cancer cases and planned realization of synergy effects from the acquisition."
"Therefore, for the Varian segment a ten-year 
detailed planning period with an average revenue growth rate (excluding portfolio effects) of 8.4% (2022: 9.2%) was used."
"Siemens Healthineers performed sensitivity analyses based on a 10% reduction in after-tax future cash flows, a one percentage-
point increase in after-tax discount rates, or a one percentage-point decrease in the terminal value growth rate."
"None of these 
scenarios resulted in the need for a goodwill impairment."
"Thereof, €244 million are allocated to other intangible assets and €18 million to property, plant and 
equipment."
The impairment loss is mainly recognized in cost of sales.
"The cash-generating unit endovascular robotics solution is 
a product line within the segment Advanced Therapies, which develops and offers robotic-assisted platforms for coronary and 
neurovascular interventions."
"In fiscal year 2023, management decided to change business activities in a way to develop and offer 
robotic-assisted platforms only for neurovascular interventions in the future."
"In fiscal year 2023, an impairment test was 
performed for the cash-generating unit endovascular robotics solution."
"Major assets that amongst others are allocated to the 
cash-generating unit are intangible assets for technology and customer relations acquired upon the acquisition, along with 
property, plant and equipment."
"The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit amounted to €−69 million and is its fair 
value less cost of disposal."
The fair value less cost of disposal was derived from a discounted cash flow valuation (level 3).
"The 
duration of the discounted cash flow valuation was derived from the expected useful life of the major intangible assets."
"An after-tax discount rate of 
10% (2022: 9%) was used."
"Furthermore, other intangible assets with an amount of €74 million have been derecognized in fiscal year 2023 because no 
future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal."
"The derecognitions were in connection with the 
transformation of the Diagnostics business and were a result of measures to optimize the cost efficiency of the existing product 
range."
"Siemens Healthineers as lessor 
The line item equipment leased to others comprised predominately diagnostic instruments that were leased out under operating 
leases in the Diagnostics segment."
"Included 
therein were variable lease payments in the amount of €136 million (2022: €143 million)."
"Before Siemens Healthineers 
concludes contracts with the customer for the sale of reagents and consumables by providing a diagnostic instrument, the order 
volumes forecasted by the customer are analyzed and verified."
"Based on realistic sales volumes, individual prices for reagents are 
calculated, including a price offset for the diagnostic instrument."
"The average term of customer contracts covers the useful life of 
the diagnostic instruments."
"Siemens Healthineers as lessee 
The total cash outflows from leases amounted to €276 million in fiscal year 2023 (2022: €251 million)."

"Loans 
In fiscal year 2023, Siemens Healthineers repaid two loans from the Siemens Group in a total amount of US$2.0 billion."
"For 
partial refinancing, the Siemens Group provided two new fixed interest loans in a total amount of €1.4 billion, maturing in fiscal 
years 2030 and 2032."
"Moreover, the Siemens Group provided an additional €0.3 billion loan for general corporate purposes of 
Siemens Healthineers, maturing in fiscal year 2026."
"Overall, loans with the Siemens Group were mainly denominated in U.S."
"As of September 30, 2023, the 
structure of the U.S."
"Except for the loan maturing in fiscal year 2046, which is held by Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., the U.S."
"dollar-
denominated loans were hedged by forward exchange contracts and by foreign exchange swaps."
"As a result, the loans with fixed 
interest rates were effectively converted into synthetic euro-denominated loans and actual interest expenses decreased due to 
positive forward elements of the forward exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps."
"For the variable interest loan, only 
the nominal amount was hedged."
"In total, the actual volume-weighted average interest rate of the loans currently amounts to 
approximately 0.6%."
"For further information about hedging activities, please refer to  Note 26

management aims to maintain ready access to international capital markets, and thereby to financing through various debt 
instruments, as well as to sustain the ability to repay and service financial debt over time."
"For this purpose, Siemens Healthineers 
actively manages net debt (including pensions) and the ratio of net debt (including pensions) to EBITDA."
"This ratio indicates the 
approximate number of years needed to cover net debt (including pensions) with continuing income, without taking into 
account interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization."
"Net debt (including pensions) and the ratio of net debt (including 
pensions) to EBITDA are managed with a long-term outlook and with the intention that Siemens Healthineers would qualify for at 
least a stable investment grade rating."

"At present, the 
Group does not expect any material effects on net assets, financial position and results of operations from these legal 
proceedings."
"Employee-related accruals primarily included accruals for vacation and overtime 
entitlements."
"As of the reporting date, miscellaneous tax liabilities mainly comprised sales tax liabilities of €282 million 
(September 30, 2022: €242 million)."
These plans are accounted for either as defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans.
"Defined benefit plans 
The defined benefit plans cover around 56,000 participants."
"These are divided into 36,000 active employees for whom current 
service cost is recognized, 8,000 active and former employees with vested benefits for whom no more current service cost is 
recognized, and 12,000 retirees and surviving dependents who receive benefits."
"The defined benefit plans are to a certain extent 
affected by longevity, inflation and compensation increases and take into account country-specific differences."
"Major plans are 
funded with assets in external segregated benefit trusts."
"In accordance with local laws, these plans are managed in the interest 
of the beneficiaries through trust agreements with the respective benefit trusts."
"The defined benefit plans open to new entrants 
are predominantly based on contributions made by Siemens Healthineers."
"The majority of active employees 
participates in the Siemens Healthineers BSAV."
"The benefits provided under this plan are predominantly based on notional 
contributions by the company and the investment returns on the corresponding assets of this plan, with a minimum return 
guaranteed by the company."
"The frozen plans expose Siemens Healthineers to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk 
and longevity risk."
The effect of compensation increases is substantially eliminated.
"The pension plans are funded via a 
contractual trust arrangement (CTA)."
No legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply in Germany.
"United States 
In the United States, defined benefit plans are sponsored by Siemens Healthineers, which have been frozen to new entrants and 
future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts."
The plans’ assets are held in trusts.
"The trustees of 
the trusts are responsible for the administration of the assets."
"They take directions from an investment committee to which 
Siemens Healthineers has delegated supervision of the investment of plan assets."
"The plans are subject to funding requirements 
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) as amended."
"There is a regulatory requirement to maintain 
a minimum funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions."
"Annual contributions are 
calculated by independent actuaries."
"Siemens Healthineers may, at its discretion, contribute in excess of this regulatory 
requirement."
"The required funding is determined by a so-called funding 
valuation carried out every third year according to legal requirements."
"Switzerland 
Following the Swiss Law of Occupational Benefits (“Berufliches Vorsorgegesetz”, BVG), each employer must grant post-
employment benefits to qualifying employees."
"Accordingly, Siemens Healthineers sponsors cash balance plans in Switzerland."
These plans are administered by external foundations.
"The boards of the main foundations are composed of an equal number of 
employer and employee representatives of the plan sponsors."
"The boards of the foundations are responsible for the investment 
policy and the management of plan assets as well as for any changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to 
finance the benefits."
"Siemens Healthineers is required to make total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee 
contributions set out in the plan rules."
"In case of an underfunded plan, Siemens Healthineers together with the employees may 
be required to pay supplementary contributions according to a defined framework of recovery measures."

"The management of the risks is based on a defined risk 
measure (Value at Risk, VaR), which considers both plan assets and the defined benefit obligation."
"The above-mentioned risks

"The fair value of fixed income securities was based on prices 
provided by price service agencies."
"The fixed income securities were mainly traded on an active market and almost all were rated 
as investment grade."
Alternative investments mostly included investments in hedge funds and real estate investments.

The carrying amounts of the items net of valuation allowances approximated their fair values.
• The carrying amount of liabilities to the Siemens Group from U.S.
"dollar-denominated long-term loans was €8,391 million as 
of September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022: €11,679 million)."
"The fair value of these liabilities, which is based on prices 
provided by price service agencies (level 2), amounted to €6,888 million as of September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022: 
€9,916 million)."
"The carrying amount of liabilities to the Siemens Group from euro-denominated long-term fixed-rate loans 
was €2,550 million as of September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022: €850 million)."
"The fair value of these liabilities amounted 
to € 2,524 million as of September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022: €850 million) and was estimated by discounting future 
cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 2)."
"The carrying amounts of 
the remaining non-current liabilities to the Siemens Group approximated their fair value because the relevant interest rates 
approximated market interest rates."
"• The carrying amounts of other non-current financial liabilities measured at amortized cost approximated their fair value, 
which is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using market interest rates."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023

• The determination of the fair values of derivatives depended on the specific type of instrument."
"The fair values of forward 
exchange contracts were based on forward exchange rates (level 2)."
"Options were generally valued based on quoted market 
prices or based on option pricing models (level 2)."
"• Except for publicly listed investments for which a quoted price in an active market exists (level 1), the fair values of venture 
capital investments were generally determined based on prices from most recently executed financing rounds (level 3)."
"The 
fair values of other equity instruments were generally derived from a discounted cash flow valuation (level 3)."
"Expected cash 
flows are thereby subject to future market and business developments as well as price volatility."
"The discount rates applied 
take into account respective risk-adjusted capital costs."
"The fair value measurement of fund shares was based on their net 
asset values (level 2)."
"• Debt instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss consisted mainly of bonds and loans related to the financing of 
proton therapy centers."
"In this context, Siemens Healthineers, along with other debt investors, provided funds to various 
entities that are used for the development, construction and operation of proton therapy centers, primarily in the United 
States."
The repayment is either directly or indirectly linked to the commercial success of the centers.
"The fair values of the 
bonds and loans are primarily based on the individual creditworthiness of the debtor, taking into account the risk 
characteristics and operating performance of the financed project (level 3)."
"Where appropriate, a probability weighted 
expected return model is used, utilizing management's assumptions of different outcomes such as the sale, refinancing or 
closure of the therapy center."
Credit ratings are taken into account when adjusting the fair values for credit risks.
"Consequently, a better rating will generally result in an increased fair value of the loan receivable."
"In addition, the carrying amounts of trade receivables and contract 
assets related to the proton therapy centers amounted to €5 million (September 30, 2022: €9 million)."
"The carrying amounts 
represent the maximum exposure to loss."
"• The fair values of contingent consideration were derived from probability-weighted future payments, which mainly depend on 
the achievement of technical and commercial milestones as well as on the achievement of revenue targets during the earn-
out period (level 3)."
"If the estimated revenue or probabilities of completing certain milestones increase or decrease during the 
respective earn-out period, the fair value of the contingent consideration would increase or decrease, respectively."
"• Liabilities from written put options on non-controlling interests were measured at fair value, which is based on the present 
value of the exercise price of the options (level 3)."
"The exercise price is generally derived from the proportionate enterprise 
value."
"The liabilities resulted mainly from written put options in connection with interests in ECG Management Consultants 
(hereinafter “ECG”)."
"The enterprise value of ECG is calculated by an independent appraiser in accordance with a contractually 
agreed methodology and serves as a basis for the exercise price per share, which is determined at least once a year."
"The most 
significant unobservable input used to determine the fair value is financial information from the five-year business plan, 
which is mainly subject to expected business and market developments."
"In addition, weighted revenue and earnings multiples 
are considered."
"Changes resulting from the revaluation of liabilities from written put options were recognized in retained 
earnings."
"Net gains or losses on financial liabilities measured at 
amortized cost included foreign currency revaluation gains and losses."
"Net gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value through profit or loss resulted from the remeasurement of equity and debt instruments as well as from 
changes in the fair value of derivatives, which were not designated as hedging instruments."
"Net gains or losses on equity 
instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income included remeasurement gains and losses."
"In fiscal year 2023, interest expenses on financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss amounted to 
€440 million (2022: €282 million) and interest income on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss 
amounted to € 77 million (2022: €46 million)."
"Foreign currency revaluation differences recognized in profit or loss on financial 
assets and liabilities not measured at fair value amounted to €1,111 million (2022: €−2,084 million)."
"Valuation allowances for expected credit losses 
Impairments for expected credit losses were generally recorded in the line item selling and general administrative expenses in 
the consolidated statements of income."
"In connection with the acquisition of Varian, Siemens Healthineers purchased a credit-impaired loan that was originally granted 
for the financing of a proton therapy center, which has since ceased operations."
"As of September 30, 2023, the gross carrying 
amount of this loan was €0 million (September 30, 2022: €0 million), while the undiscounted contractual amount was €77 
million (September 30, 2022: €77 million)."
"There have been no significant changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial 
recognition."
"Receivables from the Siemens Group were classified in stage 1 of the general impairment approach, which means the valuation 
allowances were measured at an amount equal to the twelve-month expected credit loss."
"As of September 30, 2023, receivables 
from the Siemens Group with gross carrying amounts of €642 million (September 30, 2022: €822 million) carried an investment 
grade rating."

Offsetting 
Siemens Healthineers has entered into master netting agreements and similar agreements for derivatives."
"As of 
September 30, 2023, the gross amounts of such derivatives amounted to € 1,379 million (September 30, 2022: €2,518 million) 
for derivatives with positive fair values and € 149 million (September 30, 2022: €92 million) for derivatives with negative fair 
values."
"Thereof, € 98 million (September 30, 2022: €13 million) were subject to a master netting agreement but were not offset 
in the consolidated statements of financial position because the offsetting requirements were not met."
"Hedging activities 
As part of Siemens Healthineers’ risk management approach (please also see  Note 27  
Financial risk management), derivatives 
were used to reduce the risks resulting primarily from fluctuations in exchange rates."
"In particular, Siemens Healthineers entered 
into forward exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps in order to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows 
resulting from forecast sales and purchases, acquisitions, firm commitments and loans denominated in foreign currencies."
"In fiscal years 2023 and 2022, Siemens Healthineers did not hold any material derivatives relating to interest rate risk or 
commodity price risk."
"Cash flow hedges 
Siemens Healthineers applied hedge accounting for certain significant forecast transactions, firm commitments and loans 
denominated in foreign currencies."
"The main characteristics of the forward exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps 
designated as hedging instruments matched the underlying hedged items (e.g."
"nominal amount, maturity)."
dollar-denominated loans.
"The 
weighted average hedging rate was 1.2893 US$/€ (September 30, 2022: 1.2797 US$/€)."
"For these hedges, only the changes in 
the value of the spot element of the forward exchange contracts and the foreign exchange swaps were designated as hedging 
instruments."
"2  
Reported in the line items other current financial liabilities and other non-current financial liabilities."
"In fiscal year 2023, the changes in fair value of the hedging instruments used for measuring hedge ineffectiveness amounted to 
€−1,243 million (2022: €2,051 million)."
"The changes in value of the hedged items amounted to €1,243 million (2022: 
€−2,051 million)."
There was no material impact on profit or loss resulting from ineffectiveness.
The loss on the net monetary position amounted to €26 million (2022: €38 million).
"Note 27  Financial risk management 
Siemens Healthineers is managed centrally by the Managing Board."
"The Managing Board is responsible for the operating 
business and manages and controls financial risks in accordance with its risk management policy."
"The Siemens Group acts as a 
service provider with respect to certain financial risk management activities."
"Market risks 
Increasing market fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risks."
"The worldwide operating business 
as well as the investing and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in exchange rates and interest rates."
"In order 
to optimize the allocation of financial resources across its segments and entities as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens 
Healthineers identifies, analyzes and manages the relevant market risks."
"Siemens Healthineers seeks to manage and control 
market risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities and uses derivatives when it is appropriate."
Management of market risks is a priority for the Managing Board.
"The chief financial officer has specific responsibility for this part 
of the overall risk management system."
This responsibility is delegated to corporate treasury.
"For practical business purposes, 
Siemens Healthineers has entered into service agreements with the Siemens Group to receive support in the management of 
market risks."
"Since this fiscal year, market risks reported in this section have been quantified by using sensitivity analyses."
"Any market-sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-bearing investments, that Siemens Healthineers’ pension plans 
hold are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures."
"Exchange rate risk 
Transaction risk 
Each entity whose business leads to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to 
risks from changes in exchange rates."
"In the ordinary course of business, entities are particularly exposed to exchange rate 
fluctuations between the U.S."
"Siemens Healthineers defines exchange rate risk as the sum of the net amount of foreign-currency-denominated monetary 
items, firm commitments and planned sales and purchases in a foreign currency."
"The exchange rate risk is determined based on 
the respective functional currencies of the exposed entities."
"The exchange rate risk from cash inflows in foreign currency is partly balanced by purchasing goods, commodities and services in 
the respective currencies as well as by production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023 
Consolidated financial statements  –  Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 
91 
Entities are bound by an exchange rate risk management system established within the Group."
"Each entity is responsible for 
recording, assessing and monitoring its transaction-related exchange rate risk."
"The mandatory guideline for the treatment of 
exchange rate risks within Siemens Healthineers describes the procedure for identifying and determining the single net foreign 
currency positions."
"It commits the entities to hedge at least 75% but no more than 100% of their foreign-currency-denominated 
monetary items, firm commitments and cash flows from planned sales and purchases for the following three months."
"The 
majority of Siemens Healthineers’ hedging transactions is carried out with the corporate treasury of the Siemens Group as the 
counterparty."
"In fiscal year 2023, Siemens Healthineers introduced new treasury management software which the entities will gradually adopt."
"For manufacturing entities, a modified approach for hedging exchange rate risks is applied under which the minimum hedging 
level is based on the tenor of the forecasted cash flows, considering up to twelve months (layered hedging approach)."
"Sales 
entities will still be required to hedge at least 75% of their contracted foreign currency exposure."
Entities are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a speculative basis.
"New financing from the Siemens 
Group or investments by operating entities are carried out preferably in their functional currency."
"In case an entity is financed in 
a currency other than its functional currency, the respective foreign currency risk must be hedged 100%."
"Exchange rate risks in 
connection with the acquisition or sale of businesses are hedged on an individual basis."
The following table shows how reasonably possible appreciations and depreciations of the U.S.
"dollar and the euro against all 
other currencies would have affected Siemens Healthineers’ income before income taxes and equity."
"The impact on income 
results from the foreign currency measurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional 
currency of the respective entity."
"In addition, it includes effects from derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied or 
which are used to hedge foreign currency debt."
"In contrast, the impact on equity results from derivatives which are designated in 
a cash flow hedge and used to hedge expected purchases or sales in foreign currency."
"The sensitivity analysis neither considers 
expected transactions nor effects from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign entities into the reporting 
currency of Siemens Healthineers."

The sensitivity analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant."
"Due to dependencies between the sensitivities of 
different currencies, it is not appropriate to add up the individual amounts."
"Translation risk 
Many entities are located outside the euro zone."
"Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens Healthineers is the euro, 
the financial statements of these entities are translated into euros for preparation of the consolidated financial statements."
"To 
take account of effects of foreign currency translation in risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign 
entities are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous."
"Effects from exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net 
asset amounts into euros are reflected in the line item other components of equity."
"Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument or its future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates."
"Siemens Healthineers’ exposure to the risk of fluctuations in future cash flows and interest income or 
expenses relates, among others, to short-term bank loans as well as money market borrowings and investments at Siemens 
Group."
"Long-term liabilities to the Siemens Group primarily have fixed interest rates to reduce the risk of fluctuations in interest 
income and expenses from changes in interest rates."
"In order to quantify the interest rate risk, a sensitivity analysis was prepared, which was based on net receivables and liabilities 
with variable interest rates."
"As of September 30, 2023, a parallel shift of the interest rate curve for all currencies by +100 base 
points would have resulted in a reduction in income before income taxes by €−26 million (September 30, 2022: €−17 million)."
"In 
contrast, a parallel shift by −100 base point would have resulted in an increase in income before income taxes by €26 million 
(September 30, 2022: €17 million)."
"In fiscal years 2023 and 2022, Siemens Healthineers did not use any interest derivatives that 
could have had an impact on income or equity."
"The reasonably possible changes in interest rates are based on the currently 
observable market environment."
"Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risks relate to Siemens Healthineers’ ability to meet its financial obligations."
"As of September 30, 2023, Siemens 
Healthineers’ reserve of cash and cash equivalents amounted to €1,642 million (September 30, 2022: €1,436 million)."
"In the periods presented, Siemens Healthineers was financed largely by the Siemens Group and invested excess liquidity using 
the Siemens Group’s cash pooling and cash management systems."
"Excluded thereof are currently the entities that were acquired 
as part of the acquisition of Varian."
"For details about financing arrangements with the Siemens Group, please refer to  Note 16 
 
Financial debt."
The following table reflects the contractually fixed payoffs for repayments and interest.
"The disclosed expected undiscounted net 
cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities were determined individually for each payment date of an instrument based on 
the earliest date on which Siemens Healthineers could be required to pay."
"In addition, the majority of the financing agreements 
with the Siemens Group include change-of-control clauses that may result in early maturity (please also see  A.8.5 Significant 
agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid)."
"Cash outflows for financial liabilities 
without fixed amount are based on the conditions existing as of September 30, 2023."
The risk implied from the values shown in the table above reflects the one-sided scenario of cash outflows only.
"Trade payables 
and other financial liabilities, including lease liabilities, originate mainly from the financing of assets used in Siemens 
Healthineers’ ongoing operations, such as property, plant, equipment and investments in working capital."
"These assets are 
considered in Siemens Healthineers’ overall liquidity risk management."
"Thus, Siemens Healthineers mitigates liquidity risk 
through the implementation of effective working capital management and cash management."
"To monitor existing financial 
assets and liabilities and to enable effective control of emerging risks, Siemens Healthineers uses a comprehensive risk reporting 
system, which covers its worldwide business entities."
"Credit risk 
Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss from financial instruments if a counterparty is unable to pay its obligations in due 
time or if the value of collateral declines."
"The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and 
ratings is a core competence of Siemens Healthineers’ risk management system."
"Accordingly, binding credit policy guidelines 
were implemented."
"In principle, each entity is responsible for managing credit risk in its own operating activities."
"Ratings and individually defined credit limits are based mainly on generally accepted rating methodologies, with input consisting 
of information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and credit default experiences."
"Ratings 
consider appropriate forward-looking information significant to the specific financial instrument, such as expected changes in 
the obligor’s financial position, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry-
related and competitive developments."
"In addition, ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external 
country ratings."
"Ratings and credit limits are carefully considered in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect 
financing will be offered to customers by Siemens Healthineers."
Siemens Healthineers applies various systems and processes to analyze and monitor credit risk.
"A central IT application is 
available that provides rating and default information."
"Together with data from operating entities, this information is used as a 
Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023

basis for individual bad debt allowances."
"In addition to this automated process, qualitative information is considered to 
particularly incorporate latest developments."
"In general, deposits are held, and external hedging transactions are entered into, only with contracting parties that have an 
investment-grade rating."
"There were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk as of September 30, 2023 and 2022."
"The maximum exposure to 
credit risk for financial assets, without taking account of any collateral, is represented by their carrying amount."
"As of 
September 30, 2023, collateral and other credit enhancements held for financial assets measured at amortized cost amounted to 
€55 million (September 30, 2022: €57 million), mainly in the form of letters of credit and guarantees."
"Collateral for financial 
assets measured at fair value amounted to €98 million (September 30, 2022: €13 million) and consisted of netting agreements 
for derivatives in case of a counterparty’s insolvency."
"As of September 30, 2023, the gross carrying amount of receivables from the sale of goods and services amounted to 
€4,530 million (September 30, 2022: €4,337 million)."
"Based on rating information from Siemens Financial Services, 42% 
(September 30, 2022: 47%) of the receivables were rated with an investment-grade rating and 58% (September 30, 2022: 53%) 
with a non-investment-grade rating."
"Receivables from finance leases with a gross carrying amount of €366 million 
(September 30, 2022: €329 million) and contract assets with a gross carrying amount of €1,642 million (September 30, 2022: 
€1,430 million) generally share similar risk characteristics."
"As of the reporting date, there were no material loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts."
"Note 28  Share-based payment 
As of September 30, 2023, the carrying amount of liabilities from share-based payment amounted to €31 million 
(September 30, 2022: €22 million)."
"In fiscal year 2023, expenses for equity-settled share-based payment amounted to €109 
million (2022: €106 million)."
Expenses for share-based payment amounted to €124 million (2022: €105 million).
"Share-based payment awards granted in fiscal year 2023, including Siemens Healthineers’ stock awards and the Share Matching 
program, were based on Siemens Healthineers AG shares."
"In addition, employees continued to participate in existing share-based 
payment plans of the Siemens Group based on Siemens AG shares, mainly in the Jubilee Share program."
"Siemens Healthineers’ Stock awards 
Siemens Healthineers grants stock awards to members of the Managing Board, members of senior management and other 
eligible employees."
"These entitle beneficiaries after expiry of the vesting period to receive Siemens Healthineers AG shares 
without payment of consideration (Siemens Healthineers’ stock awards)."
"In fiscal year 2023, Siemens Healthineers granted Siemens Healthineers’ stock awards to members of the Managing Board, 
members of senior management and other eligible employees."
"As in the prior year, the major portion of the Siemens 
Healthineers’ stock awards granted to members of senior management and other eligible employees depended solely on 
fulfillment of the employee’s respective service condition (plan design II)."
"In addition, Siemens Healthineers granted stock awards 
to members of the Managing Board and eligible members of senior management and other eligible employees that continue to 
be tied to performance criteria (plan design I)."
"As in the prior year, within the target amount for eligible members of senior 
management and other eligible employees, 80% is linked to the development of total shareholder return, as compared to two 
equally weighted external indices during the vesting period (TSR target)."
"The remaining 20% of the target amount is linked to an

Under the Share Matching program, Siemens Healthineers offers plans which entitle beneficiaries to receive Siemens 
Healthineers AG shares."
These plans are classified as equity-settled share-based payment.
"The weighted average fair value of the 
Siemens Healthineers’ matching shares granted in fiscal year 2023 was €45.35 per share (2022: €50.53 per share)."
"It was 
derived from the share price less the present value of expected dividends and taking into account non-vesting conditions."
"The shares are purchased at the market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter of each fiscal 
year."
"The shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once 
a month."
"The Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers AG 
decided to transfer the shares acquired under the 2022 tranche to the share matching plan in February 2023."
"Base share program 
Under the base share program, employees of participating entities can invest a fixed amount of their compensation in shares, 
which is then matched by Siemens Healthineers."
"The shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date in the second 
quarter of each fiscal year and grant the right to receive matching shares under the same conditions applying to the share 
matching plan described above."
"Jubilee Share program 
For their 25th and 40th service anniversaries, eligible employees in Germany receive jubilee shares in form of Siemens AG 
shares."

"Measurement and reconciliations 
Accounting policies for segment information are generally the same as those summarized in  Note 2  
Accounting policies Any 
exceptions or supplements are outlined below or become apparent in the reconciliations."
"Adjusted revenue 
At the segment level, revenue is defined as total revenue and corresponds to the sum of external and intersegment revenue."
"Total adjusted revenue of the segments is additionally adjusted for effects in line with revaluation of contract liabilities from 
IFRS 3, Business Combinations, purchase price allocations."
Revenue includes revenue from contracts with customers and revenue from leasing activities.
"In fiscal year 2023, income from 
leases amounted to €362 million (2022: €401 million)."
"In fiscal year 2023, revenue from rapid COVID-19 antigen tests in the 
Diagnostics segment amounted to €121 million (2022: €1,550 million)."
"For each of the segments, revenue results mainly from performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, especially in the case 
of the sale of goods, including reagents and consumables."
"However, the performance obligations related to maintenance 
contracts for equipment sold are generally satisfied over time with revenue recognized on a straight-line basis."
"As of the reporting date, the aggregate amount of trans 
action prices allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied 
or partially unsatisfied (order backlog) amounted to €34 billion (September 30, 2022: €34 billion)."
"Thereof, €11 billion 
(September 30, 2022: €12 billion) are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next twelve months."
Intersegment revenue is based on market prices.
"Adjusted EBIT 
Adjusted EBIT margin is used to manage the operating performance of our segments."
"Adjusted EBIT margin is defined as the 
adjusted EBIT of the particular segment concerned, divided by its total adjusted revenue."
"Income tax expenses are excluded from the segments’ adjusted EBIT because income taxes are subject to legal structures, which 
typically do not correspond to the segment’s structure."
"Financial income, net, comprises other financing income, net, and any 
interest income or expenses."
"Financing income, net, is excluded from the segments’ adjusted EBIT because decision-making 
regarding financing is typically made at the Group level."
Decisions on essential pension items are made centrally.
"Accordingly, the segments’ adjusted EBIT includes amounts 
related primarily to service cost of pension plans, while other regularly recurring pension related expenses (“centrally carried 
pension service and administration expenses”) are excluded."
"Certain items that are not indicative of the segments’ performance 
are also excluded from adjusted EBIT, such as items that have a corporate or central character or refer to more than one 
reportable segment, to corporate treasury or to Siemens Healthineers Real Estate."
"Costs for support functions are allocated 
predominantly to the segments."
"2 Comparable based on the organizational structure effective October 1, 2022."
"3  
Including expenses for impairment of other intangible assets in the amount of €244 million."
Severance charges increased in the amount of €96 million to €167 million.
"Therein included were higher severance charges 
mainly for the Diagnostics segment."
Expenses for other portfolio-related measures were €349 million.
"This was due to the focusing of the endovascular robotics 
solution exclusively on interventional solutions in neurology and the associated withdrawal from the robotic-assisted 
endovascular cardiology business in the Advanced Therapies segment."
"The line item Corporate items includes corporate costs, such as costs of Group management and corporate projects as well as 
business activities and special topics that were not allocated directly to the segments."

"• Siemens Healthineers has entered into leasing transactions with the Siemens Group and related benefit trusts that fund 
pension obligations, mainly for real estate."
"As of September 30, 2023, total lease liabilities amounted to €53 million 
(September 30, 2022: €57 million)."
"Thereby, Siemens 
Healthineers invested excess liquidity in the short term and was granted overdraft facilities for financing its operating 
activities."
• The liabilities to other Siemens Group entities decreased due to the repayment of two matured loans totaling US$2.0 billion.
"This amount was partially offset by a new loan for refinancing purposes in the amount of €0.7 billion, maturing in fiscal year 
2032, and an additional loan for general corporate purposes in the amount of €0.3 billion, maturing in fiscal year 2026."
"Furthermore, the liabilities decreased due to effects from foreign currency revaluation."
"• The liabilities to Siemens AG increased due mainly to a new loan in the amount of €0.7 billion to refinance the repayment of 
loans mentioned above."
The additional loan will mature in fiscal year 2030.
"In fiscal year 2023, interest expenses from financing arrangements with Siemens AG amounted to €125 million (2022:

(2022: €58 million)."
These included positive effects from the hedging of exchange rate risks of U.S.
dollar-denominated loans.
"In fiscal year 2023, interest income from financing arrangements with Siemens AG amounted to €25 million (2022: €5 million);

management report of Siemens Healthineers AG, which is combined with the management report of Siemens Healthineers AG, 
for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023."
"In all material 
respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal 
requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development."
"322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"Basis for the opinions  
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with 
Sec."
"317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance 
with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer 
[Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"In conducting the audit of the consolidated financial statements we also 
complied with International Standards on Auditing (ISA)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards 
are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group 
management report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the 
requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German 
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Art."
"10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services 
prohibited under Art."
5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report."
"These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters."
"Below, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters: 
Revenue recognition 
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Group’s revenue stems from the sale of imaging, diagnostics 
and therapy products and related maintenance and other services."
"Financial management of the group is generally based on 
comparable revenue growth and adjusted basic earnings per share."
"The development of these key performance indicators is 
primarily determined by the amount of revenue recognized."
"In view of the materiality of revenue and its significance for the 
financial management of the Group, we consider revenue recognition to be an area posing a significant risk of material 
misstatement (including the potential risk of managers circumventing controls) and one of the key audit matters."
"Auditor’s response: As part of our audit, we identified all significant revenue streams subject to different processes, risks and 
controls."
"For these revenue streams we assessed the different revenue recognition processes and the design of the accounting-
related internal control system in relation to revenue recognition."
"We planned the nature, timing and scope of substantive audit 
procedures according to our individual assessment of the risk inherent in the different revenue streams."
We also performed cut-off analyses of revenue transactions around the reporting date.
"We supplemented data analytics with 
sample testing specifically focusing on revenues for imaging and therapy products and assessed the amount and timing of 
revenue recognized on the basis of contracts, invoices and delivery notes."
"As part of these procedures, we also obtained external 
customer confirmations and reviewed credit notes issued after the reporting date."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the recognition of revenue from the sale of products and the 
provision of services."
"Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for the recognition of revenue, 
refer to  Note 2  
Accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Testing impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets 
involves considerable judgment in estimating future cash flows and discount rates."
"The recoverability of goodwill and other 
intangible assets was one of the key audit matters due to their materiality as well as the existing estimation uncertainties and 
judgment."
"Auditor’s response: To assess the recoverable amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets determined by management, we 
examined the underlying processes."
"We obtained an understanding of the underlying valuation models used to determine the 
recoverable amounts by verifying the applied methodology and arithmetical correctness."
"To assess estimates of future net cash 
flows, we reconciled approved budgets with the valuations provided to us."
"We also examined whether the budget reflects 
general, industry and product-specific market expectations."
"We performed a budget-to-actual comparison of historically 
forecasted data and actual results, where available, on a sample basis to assess forecast accuracy."
"We examined the inputs used 
to estimate recoverable amounts, such as the estimated growth rates and the discount rates, by comparing them with publicly 
available market."
We also performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment risk in case of changes in significant assumptions.
"In addition, 
we analyzed the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on the measurement of goodwill and other 
intangible assets in relation to the requirements of IAS 36."
"We consulted internal valuation specialists to assess the recoverable 
amounts."
Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets.
"For explanatory notes on goodwill and other intangible 
assets, refer to the disclosures in  Note 12  
Goodwill and  Note 13  
Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements."

on the Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the Corporate Governance Statement."
"In all other respects, management is 
responsible for the other information."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, 
and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact."
We have nothing to report in this regard.

requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern."
"It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, 
management is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."

"Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec."
"317 
HGB and the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement 
Audits promulgated by the IDW and in supplementary compliance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial 
statements and this group management report."
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
"The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control."
"• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by 
management and related disclosures."
"•  
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group 
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the Group 
to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
"•  
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report."
"We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our opinions.
"•  
Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with 
German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"•  
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group management report."
"On the 
basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a 
basis for the prospective information and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these 
assumptions."
We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis.
There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence 
requirements and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence and where applicable, the related safeguards."
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

main cause of high inflation and disrupted supply chains."
"In this situation, Siemens Healthineers proved itself to be a reliable 
partner to its customers, a preferred employer in the many, many countries in which the company operates, and a sustainably 
successful business enterprise."
"The basis for this success is not least the intact drivers of our business: On the one hand, the 
growing world population with rising life expectancy and the resulting demand for medical care; on the other hand, the fact that 
nearly half the world’s population lacks access to modern healthcare."
"The resulting task and obligation for health and the 
environment are succinctly expressed in the corporate purpose of Siemens Healthineers: “We pioneer breakthroughs in 
healthcare."
"Sustainably.”  
To live up to this claim today and in the future, the company continuously invests in its infrastructure and employees."
"In 2023, 
Siemens Healthineers opened a modern training and education center and an additional innovation center in Erlangen."
"The new 
innovation center is part of a network of innovation centers in Shanghai (China) and Bengaluru (India)."
"Moreover, a new reagent 
factory for laboratory diagnostics started operating in Shanghai."
"Other projects include the expansion of the development and 
manufacturing site in Shenzhen (China), the construction of a new factory to grow crystals for semiconductor production in the 
Bavarian city of Forchheim, and the expansion of the sites in Kemnath and Rudolstadt (both in Germany)."
"Great importance was 
attached to climate protection and sustainability in the construction of new facilities and the expansion of existing facilities."

fact, Siemens Healthineers has again raised its already ambitious sustainability targets: By the year 2030, the company will seek 
to reduce its direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 90 percent from the 2019 baseline."
"Details on sustainability at 
Siemens Healthineers, which encompasses resource conservation, health, and diversity, can be found in the Sustainability Report 
2023."
"The company also expanded longstanding partnerships in fiscal year 2023, including the strategic partnerships with the non-
profit healthcare providers Atrium Health and SSM Health in the United States."
"Another strategic partnership was initiated with 
Unilabs, a European supplier of diagnostics solutions, with operations globally."
The company has successfully completed the first half of its “New Ambition” phase.
"It has made good progress in implementing 
its strategic objectives: Siemens Healthineers is harnessing innovative medical technology, digital transformation, and artificial 
intelligence to improve both access to healthcare for patients and the rapidly growing medical expertise for physicians."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks, personally and on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthineers, to all 
our people for the very good results in the past fiscal year."
"The people of Siemens Healthineers have displayed extraordinary 
dedication and proved once again that they live and breathe our corporate purpose to the fullest, even beyond the scope of our 
business activities."
"I am referring to the prompt aid campaigns and donations raised in response to the earthquakes in Turkey, 
Syria, and Morocco, the devastating floods in Libya and the war in the Ukraine."
"In total, the employees of Siemens Healthineers 
and the company itself have raised €1.5 million in donations to date."
"In August 2023, the Supervisory Board unanimously and prematurely renewed the appointment of Darleen Caron as Chief 
Human Resources Officer."
"Darleen Caron has elevated the human resources work of Siemens Healthineers to an internationally 
leading level."
"Under her leadership, the company has made considerable progress both in its sustainability program and in the 
development of a diverse and inclusive corporate culture that supports the achievement of the company’s ambitious business 
goals."
"I would like to express my special gratitude to those members of the Supervisory Board whose terms of office ended at the last 
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in February 2023."
"Dr. Philipp Rösler, Dr. Gregory Sorensen, Dr. Norbert Gaus, and Dr. Andreas C."
Hoffmann have overseen the business of Siemens Healthineers with expertise and passion in its first years as a listed company.

Managing Board in attendance, when it dealt with agenda items that related to the Managing Board itself or internal Supervisory 
Board matters."
"At our meeting on November 8, 2022, we discussed the key financial data for the fourth fiscal quarter and for fiscal year 2022 
and examined the amended budget for 2023 and the developments in the Laboratory Diagnostics business."

members and set the targets for the new 2023 tranche."
"We also discussed the appropriateness of Managing Board compensation 
and established the amounts of short-term variable compensation to be disbursed to the Managing Board members for fiscal 
year 2022 on the basis of the identified and specified target achievement levels."
"Furthermore, we set the targets for the 
Managing Board’s one-year variable compensation for fiscal year 2023."
"At the meeting on February 1, 2023, the Managing Board reported on the company’s net assets, financial position, and results of 
operations at the close of the first fiscal quarter."

"As eight new Supervisory Board members were elected at the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, a constituent meeting of the

"At this meeting, Prof. Dr. 
Ralf P."
Thomas was re-elected as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

Chairman."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board held elections for the members and chairs of the committees insofar as these were

"Other items on the agenda were the resolution 
on the targets to be set for the Managing Board and Supervisory Board and the engagement of the independent auditor to

presented to the Supervisory Board."
"At the meeting on August 1, 2023, the Managing Board reported on the company’s net assets, financial position, and results of 
operations at of the close of the third fiscal quarter."
"We also adopted an approval resolution regarding the Managing Board’s

currently registered under Siemens Healthcare GmbH to Siemens Healthineers AG."
"A further resolution was passed on the re-
election of Managing Board member Darleen Caron and the renewal of her contract."
"Another agenda item involved the adoption 
of a resolution on a spin-off and transfer agreement to be concluded in the context of the ongoing project to simplify the 
structure of the Siemens Healthineers Group and establish a co-determined Supervisory Board at the level of 
Siemens Healthineers AG."
"The meeting on September 26, 2023 centered on the 2024 budget and the strategic focus of the businesses."

necessary to fulfill their duties."

appropriately supported by the company in these efforts."
"The company offered the Supervisory Board members seven 
informational events during the fiscal year, each one featuring ample opportunities for questions and discussion."
"The aim of these events, which are also planned for the coming fiscal year, is to give the

The Related-Party Transactions Committee decides on the approval of related party transactions within the meaning of Sections

"The aspect of diversity is an important selection criterion in filling Managing Board positions, 
including aspects such as age, gender, and educational and professional background."
"The aim is for the Managing Board as a whole to have all the knowledge and experience that are considered essential in light of 
the activities of Siemens Healthineers."
"• Collectively, the Managing Board should have experience of the lines of business important to Siemens Healthineers, in 
particular (diagnostic) imaging, laboratory diagnostics, clinical therapy, and cancer care."
"• Appointments to Managing Board positions should also take into account the targets that the Supervisory Board has specified 
for the share of women on the Managing Board."
• It is regarded as useful to have different age groups represented on the Managing Board.
"In accordance with the 
recommendation of the GCGC, the Supervisory Board has set an age limit for members of the Managing Board."
"In general, an 
appointment or a renewal of an appointment to the Managing Board is permitted only for persons who have not yet reached 
the age of 63."
"The decisive factor in filling a specific Managing Board position is always the company’s interest, taking into account all 
circumstances of the individual case."
The diversity concept is implemented as part of the procedure for the Supervisory Board’s appointment of the Managing Board.
"In 
selecting candidates, the Supervisory Board takes note of legal requirements and takes account of the requirements set out in 
the qualification profile defined by the Supervisory Board with the diversity concept for the Managing Board."
"The decision made in the reporting period to renew the appointment of Darleen Caron as Chief Human Resources Officer was 
based on her in-depth, company-specific experience and the company’s international orientation."
"Other factors supporting this 
decision were the aspects of gender, age, and cultural background."
"Information on the areas of responsibility and the curricula 
vitae of Darleen Caron and the other members of the Managing Board is available on the company’s website at  www.siemens-
healthineers.com/company/management."
"Targets for the share of women 
Pursuant to the Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board is to set targets for the share of women on the Managing Board."
The Managing Board is to set targets for the share of women at the two levels of management below the Managing Board.
"If the 
share of women is less than 30% when the targets are set, the targets cannot be below the level that has already been achieved."
"At Siemens Healthineers AG, a target of at least one woman on the Managing Board was set, to be attained by June 30, 2023."
"This target was now set for repeated attainment by September 30, 2026."
"With the Managing Board members Darleen Caron and 
Elisabeth Staudinger-Leibrecht, the share of women on the Managing Board is at 50% since December 1, 2021, the target set for 
the Managing Board thus being exceeded."
There is only one management level below the Managing Board.
"In July 2022 the target for this management level was set to 
33%, to be attained by September 30, 2026."
"To this 
end, the Supervisory Board and the Chairperson’s Committee regularly discuss potential candidates for the Managing Board."
"The 
Chair of the Managing Board and the Chief Human Resources Officer are involved, unless the discussion is about their own 
succession."
"The specific requirement profiles for future Managing Board members defined by the Supervisory Board are not 
static, but are defined individually at the start of every new succession-planning project, taking into account the current 
responsibility-specific needs and concrete challenges."
This planning work is performed with an appropriate lead time.
"In this 
process, the Supervisory Board and the Chairperson’s Committee pursue the approved profile of skills and expertise, including the 
diversity concept, ensuring that the knowledge, abilities, and experience of all members of the Managing Board are diverse and 
balanced."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board regularly receives information on succession planning for the level below the 
Managing Board and advises the Managing Board on this matter."
"The Supervisory Board is also given an opportunity to review 
potential candidates itself."
"The appointment of the owners of certain executive functions on the first level below the Managing 
Board requires the approval of the Chairperson’s Committee."
"This framework 
requires the composition of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthineers AG to be such as to ensure that its members 
collectively are qualified to supervise and advise the Managing Board."
"Diversity concept for the Supervisory Board 
Sufficient diversity is expected in the composition of the Supervisory Board."
"In addition to an appropriate gender ratio, this also 
includes diversity with regard to cultural origin, diversity of professional background, experience, and mindset."
"When examining 
potential candidates for appointments to Supervisory Board positions, diversity should be given appropriate consideration early 
on in the selection process."
"In the process of selecting and nominating candidates for the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board takes account of the 
targets for its composition and the requirements laid down in the diversity concept."
"Targets for female representation on the Supervisory Board 
Pursuant to the Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board is to set a target for the share of women on the Supervisory Board."
"If the share of women is less than 30% when the target is set, the target cannot be below the level that has already been 
achieved."
"At Siemens Healthineers AG, a target of at least 2/9 was set for the share of women on the Supervisory Board, to be attained by 
the date of June 30, 2023."
"Subsequently, a target of at least 30% was set for the share of women on the Supervisory Board, to be 
attained by September 30, 2026."
"Until the end of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on February 15, 2023, two women, Dr. Marion Helmes and Dr. Nathalie von 
Siemens, held positions on the Supervisory Board."
"Since the election of Supervisory Board members by the Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting on February 15, 2023, there are four women (Dr. Marion Helmes, Dr. Nathalie von Siemens, Sarena Lin, Veronika 
Bienert) on the Supervisory Board."
"Thus, the target was attained ahead of time both with regard to the original target 
achievement date (June 30, 2023) and with regard to the current target achievement (September 30, 2026)."
"In both cases, the 
target was over-fulfilled."
The share of women on the Supervisory Board is now 40%.
"The candidates proposed for election to the Supervisory Board should have the knowledge, skills, and experience that enable 
them to perform the duties of a supervisory board member at an international enterprise and strengthen the public image of 
Siemens Healthineers."
"The character, integrity, motivation, and professionalism of the persons proposed for election should be 
given particular consideration."
"Pursuant to the Stock Corporation Act, at least one member of the Supervisory Board should have knowledge of accounting and 
at least one further member should have knowledge of auditing financial statements."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board should 
collectively be familiar with the sector in which Siemens Healthineers operates."
"Accounting and auditing financial statements include sustainability 
reporting and the auditing thereof."
"The Chair of the Audit Committee should have the appropriate knowledge in at least one of 
the two areas."
This person should also be independent.
"The aim is for the Supervisory Board as a whole to have all the knowledge and experience considered essential in view of the 
activities of Siemens Healthineers."
"The Supervisory Board’s skills 
and expertise profile shall also comprise expertise regarding sustainability issues2 relevant to the enterprise, in particular 
regarding access to care."
"The Supervisory Board should also have knowledge and experience of the lines of business important to 
Siemens Healthineers, in particular (diagnostic) imaging, laboratory diagnostics, clinical therapy, and cancer care."
"In particular, 
the Supervisory Board should also include persons who have management experience at a large international enterprise as a 
result of holding an executive position."
"Before potential new members are considered, the Supervisory Board should conduct a review to determine which of its required 
skills and expertise need to be strengthened."
"With its current membership, the Supervisory Board satisfies the profile of required skills and expertise."
"The Supervisory Board 
members have the professional and personal qualifications considered necessary."
"As a group, they are familiar with the sector in 
which the company operates and have the knowledge, skills, and experience essential for Siemens Healthineers."
"The status of 
implementation in respect of the professional competence of the Supervisory Board is set out below in the form of a skills matrix."

In the person of Prof. Dr. Ralf P."
"Thomas, the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee each have at least one member with special 
knowledge of accounting."
"As regards the auditing of financial statements, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee each have at least one person 
with the corresponding expertise in the person of Dr. Marion Helmes, Chair of the Audit Committee."
"Dr. Marion Helmes, the independent chair of the Audit Committee, thus satisfies the GCGC 
recommendations for the chair of that committee."
"In addition, it is the Supervisory Board’s opinion that all members of the Audit Committee have the requisite knowledge of 
accounting, auditing financial statements, and internal control procedures."
"International profile 
In the light of the company’s international reach, it should be ensured that the Supervisory Board has a sufficient number of 
members with many years’ international experience."
"A considerable number of Supervisory Board members are engaged in international activities and/or have many years of 
international experience."
"Independence 
In accordance with the GCGC, the Supervisory Board should include what it considers to be an appropriate number of 
independent members from the group of shareholder representatives, thereby taking into account the shareholder structure."
"Within the meaning of this recommendation of the GCGC, a Supervisory Board member is considered independent if he/she is 
independent of the company and its Managing Board, and independent of any controlling shareholder."
"The composition of the 
Supervisory Board should be such that at least three independent shareholder representatives who meet the above criteria of 
independence are members of the Supervisory Board."
"Under the GCGC, more than half of the shareholder representatives should be independent of the company and the Managing 
Board."
"Supervisory Board members are to be considered independent of the company and its Managing Board if they have no 
personal or business relationship with the company or its Managing Board that may cause a substantial – and not merely 
temporary – conflict of interest."
"In assessing whether its Supervisory Board members are independent of the company or its Managing Board, the shareholder 
representatives should take into account the aspects stated in C.7 GCGC."
"If the company has a controlling shareholder, and the Supervisory Board comprises more than six members, the GCGC 
recommends that at least two shareholder representatives should be independent of the controlling shareholder."
The Supervisory Board has an adequate number of independent members.
"In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, there are 
currently six Supervisory Board members who are independent of the company, its Managing Board, and the majority 
shareholder – namely, Dr. Marion Helmes, Sarena Lin, Dow R."
"Wilson, Nathalie von Siemens, Peer M."
"Schatz, and Karl Heinz 
Streibich."
"In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, all its members are currently independent of the company and its Managing Board."
"Some members of the Supervisory Board hold positions of significant responsibility in other companies with which Siemens 
Healthineers maintains relationships in the ordinary course of business."
"The Supervisory Board believes that none of these 
relationships should be considered material."
"Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2023

Every Supervisory Board member must ensure that they have enough time to perform their tasks."
"The legal limits on the number 
of positions, and the upper limit recommended by the GCGC of two supervisory board positions for Managing Board members of 
publicly listed companies and five supervisory board positions for other members, must be taken into consideration."
"Age limit and length of membership 
Observing the age limit laid down by the Supervisory Board in the bylaws, only persons who at the time of election have not yet 
reached the age of 71 should usually be proposed for election as a member of the Supervisory Board."
