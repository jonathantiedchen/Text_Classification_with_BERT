Dear readers, 
and 

friends of Symrise,
   
 Taking responsibility is becoming ever  
more important, especially in times of crisis."
"In our 
private lives, this means taking care of our family 
and friends, and increasingly also looking after our-
selves and achieving a healthy work-life balance."
"In a professional context, we are responsible for our 
work but also for the way we treat the people we 
work with."
"Companies have a responsibility too – to-
ward their stakeholders but also toward the world 
around them."
"This is particularly true for Symrise: We 
benefit from the environment and from biodiversity 
since most of our products are of natural origin."
"This 
means that acting sustainably is the way to continue 
our commercial success – another responsibility."
"This responsible approach is serving us well, and we 
achieved another good result in the past fiscal year."
"Despite the geopolitical upheaval impacting our supply 
chains, and despite high inflation and exchange rate 
effects that more than halved our organic growth, we 
increased our sales by 7.9 %."
"This was the 18th suc-
cessive year of growth."
"We again outperformed our 
5 % to 7 % target for sales growth, putting us in an 
industry-leading position."
All segments played their part in this success.
"Sales 
in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment were up by 
9.3 % in organic terms."
"In the Scent & Care segment, 
the figure was 5.6 %."
"High growth was also seen  
for Food & Beverage, for example."
"Pet Food sales, too, 
were up sharply, posting double-digit growth in  
percentage terms."
"In the Scent & Care segment, the 
dynamic trend continued particularly in Fine Fra-
grances, Cosmetic Ingredients, Micro Protection and 
Sun Protection."
"This ongoing positive development was thanks to  
our three-pillar strategy: growth, efficiency and port-
folio."
"Building on this strategy, we have been the  
first in the industry to diversify our business model 
in recent years, making us less vulnerable to crises 
and economic fluctuations."
"Where it makes sense, we 
have added to our core business areas of flavor and 
fragrances."
"In 2008, around 10 % of our sales came 
from products outside our traditional fields."
"Today,  
it is already more than 30 %."
"In 2028, we want these 
products to account for half of our sales, and we  
have also defined new medium-term targets for that 
same year."
"We intend to generate product sales of

€ 7.5 to 8 billion, while at the same time maintaining 
our margin."
"Our broad regional presence, and a  
customer base ranging from small regional companies 
to global corporations, will help us achieve this."
"Our commitment to greater sustainability is also bear-
ing fruit."
"We are on course to achieve the target of  
net zero emissions (Scope 1+2) in 2030."
"In this way, we 
are actively supporting the principles of responsible 
management in the United Nations Global Compact."
"Our commitment is also reflected in the many awards 
we have received for our sustainability efforts."
"Together with our approximately 13,000 employees, 
we are excited about the year ahead, which is a  
very special one for our company."
"Exactly a century 
and a half ago, in 1874, Wilhelm Haarmann and  
Ferdinand Tiemann made a discovery."
"Working in 
Holzminden, they developed a process for synthesizing 
vanillin using the sap of conifer wood."
"Haarmann 
went on to establish the company Haarmann & Reimer, 
which in 2003 merged with Dragoco, another long- 
standing Holzminden business, to create Symrise."
"The founders embodied the qualities we want to 
continue: They took responsibility – for themselves, 
their employees and all other stakeholders."
"We,  
the members of the Executive Board team, feel deeply 
honor-bound to this tradition."
"This commitment  
will not waver one bit under the board leadership of 
Jean-Yves Parisot, who will succeed Heinz-Jürgen 
Bertram as CEO."
"Building on our strong foundation 
and inspired by a culture that has evolved during 
more than 150 successful years in business, we will 
continue to shape our industry and sustainably  
and successfully operate our company."
"You can read 
about how we have put this ambition into practice 
over the past year in our Corporate Report 2023."
" As an active member of the Global Compact, we adhere 
to its universal principles for responsible corporate manage-
ment as well as to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of 
the United Nations."
"We actively contribute to achieving them 
along our entire value chain, from the generation of raw materials 
and product development to our customer relationships."
"We act sustainably throughout these stages of the value creation 
process and with regard to our material topics."
"This chapter 
focuses on the four topics for which we bear particular responsi-
bility and on which we have signifi
 cant infl
 uence."
"Sustainable 
partnerships and dialogue with our employees and stakeholders 
are our main starting point and our motivation."
"With this in 
mind, the following pages present the perspectives of several of 
our internal dialogue partners on the topics identifi
 ed by means 
of a materiality analysis and the biggest challenges associated 
with them."
"All 
information has been externally audited in accordance with the 
AA1000 Assurance Standard."
"The aforementioned laws and standards 
use the terms “net zero” or “greenhouse gas neutrality” 
(GHG neutrality)."
"In order to ensure the highest possible degree of congru-
ence with the terms used in the regulations, the term 
“climate positive” will be replaced by the term “net zero” 
in Symrise’s future external communications."
"However, 
this will have no impact on the global implementation of 
Symrise AG’s integrated climate strategy and, in partic-
ular, the planned activities to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions."
"According to the above-mentioned regulatory develop-
ments and other common standards, the term “climate 
positive” implies a net negative GHG balance, taking into 
account all of the company’s activities."
"The term “net zero” refers to the net emissions of an orga-
nization, which are calculated by subtracting the green-
house gas reduc 
tions or removals from the atmosphere 
from the greenhouse gas emissions in the GHG balance."
"Furthermore, this term only includes greenhouse gases 
that are defined as such in the UN framework."
"It is also 
the basis for important initiatives such as the Science Based 
Targets initiative and global industry standards such 
as ISO."
"According to the current state of discussion, “positivity” 
cannot be achieved, or can only be achieved at high cost."

are largely based on natural raw materials such as 
vanilla, citrus fruits, onions, fish, meat, blossoms and 
other plant materials."
Our company’s origins go back to the year 1874.
"Since 
our initial public offering in 2006, we have grown 
faster than the market – and largely organically."
"To 
achieve this, we have made targeted investments  
in capacity expansions, in research and development

Our purpose

Who we are 
Products that appeal to the senses."
"Ingredients that are 
healthy and tasty for the nutrition of people and ani- 
mals."
"Perfume compositions and cosmetics solutions that 
offer added value with innovative and active ingredi-
ents."
"We look to the future, take heed of trends and pay 
attention to what our customers and consumers want."
"We are continuously expanding our portfolio and collect-

"We secure our economic success by  
developing solutions that are sustainable in the long term –
while keeping our sights on the environment."
"What we are proud of
Of our international, highly diverse team, which is on  
all continents and in all markets."
"Every team member 
plays an active role through its entrepreneurial spirit and 
visionary ideas."
"Of the 10,000 raw materials produced

grated backward into our value chain."

that are both scientifically and economically excellent."

"­
Because for us, acting sustainably is not only a duty but 
an aspiration to operate successfully."
"The world of the future  
That moves us all
People want to meet their basic needs in a safe and 
­
reliable way: they need to eat and drink, want to look after 
themselves and enjoy their lives."
"But we only have 
limited resources."
"Furthermore, the economy is global – 
and still it is marked by many regional and even local 
features in many respects."
"This is also due in great part 
to digitalization, which makes many aspects clearer and 
more individual and ensures greater speed – to which 
companies must adjust their processes."
"Last but not least, 
the preferences of consumers are also changing rapidly."
"There has not been a “one-size-fits-all” solution for quite 
some time now."
"People demand products that have the 
smallest possible impact on the environment and simul-
taneously have a positive effect on all areas of life."
"Our commitment  
How we think and act
We must work as a team along the entire value chain."
"That applies to us at Symrise, where we cooperate in 
a cross-business manner, work together to unlock poten-
tial and produce sustainably."
"And we do not differentiate 
when it comes to our partners."
"We work together with 
our suppliers and partners on equal footing and based 
on trust in order to reach our common goals."
"In doing so, 
we keep our focus on ­
people – the consumers."
"They tell 
us what they want and we deliver the best solutions."
"And 
we always act guided by the core of our business model: 
We want to sustainably ensure the protection of bio­
logical diversity."
"At the same time, we observe our social 
responsibility toward people and animals."
"Because only 
then can we continue to be successful."

 As we previously announced, we plan to in-
crease our sales to the level of between € 5.5 billion 
and € 6 billion by 2025."
"We have set a new long-term 
target for sales as well: We plan to increase sales to 
the level of € 7.5 billion to € 8 billion by 2028."
"To achieve this goal for the long term, we must simul-
taneously keep a close eye on the climate, the envi­
ronment and use of resources."
"Faced with a world 
population that crossed the 8 billion barrier in 2022, 
we can no longer do business the way that we  
used to."
"One solution is to separate our commercial 
activities from the use of finite resources."
"This is  
a really important task for Symrise, because our busi-
ness model is based on the diversity of nature."
"We 
manufacture more than 35,000 products that we make 
from around 10,000 – mostly natural – raw materials 
such as vanilla, citrus products and flower and plant 
materials."
"Nature is a source of inspiration and inno-
vation for us."
"This is why we have worked from the 
beginning to protect biodiversity and the environ-
ment by applying a responsible sourcing strategy."
"It 
covers all steps in the supply chain and includes in 
particular the observance of human rights along with 
environmental issues."
"We are also increasing our sustainability performance 
along the entire value chain."
"As part of this effort,  
we have been applying the principles of a circular 
economy for years and have integrated them into 
more and more processes."
"This approach enables us 
to eliminate waste and environmental pollution,  
circulate nonrenewable resources in cycles, sustain-
ably obtain renewable resources and regenerate  
nature all at the same time."
"One milestone in the sustainability concept we devel-
oped in 2020 is the goal of achieving greenhouse  
Our integrated 
corporate strategy
Sustainability is an integral part of Symrise’s corporate 
strategy."
"We must act in a commercially successful, sustainable 
and socially responsible manner in order to continuously  
increase the company’s value and minimize risks."
"We bolster  
the future of our company by taking this approach."
"From this point forward, the 
business activities of Symrise should help prevent  
or sequester more greenhouse gas emissions from the 
atmosphere than we produce in our operations."
"Four pillars for greater sustainability
One key driver behind our integrated corporate strat-
egy is the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals."
"They are also a key 
factor that is used to set remuneration paid to  
members of our Executive Board."
"Our strategy was 
endorsed in 2023 by a regular materiality analysis 
conducted during the year, interviews with experts, 
an online survey of employees and in-depth discus-
sions with management."
"It turned out that the mate­
rial topics have not changed significantly."
"Please  
see the Sustainability Record 2023 (GRI) for additional 
information on this materiality analysis."
"We have to be successful in business to hit our sus-
tainability targets."
"We focus on three pillars to do so: 
growth, efficiency and portfolio."
"Growth
We plan to expand our market share by increasing 
sales on an above-average and organic basis by  
5 % to 7 % (CAGR)."
"To do so, we began to work early 
and intensely in rapidly growing emerging countries."
"We have been represented in Brazil since 1956, in 
China since 1982 and in India since 1994."
"We are also 
working to remain the innovation leader in our core 
areas of expertise, provide our broad line of products 
to our customers even more systematically and 
strengthen collaboration in the process."
"To under-
pin our growth strategy, we will invest about 
€ 600 million in property, plants and equipment as 
well as in intangible fixed assets (excluding acquisi-
tions) by 2025."
"These funds will flow into new facilities 
in the United States, Mexico, China, Spain and 
France as well as into expanded production facilities 
in Germany and Mexico, among other areas."
"Our activities along the value chain are connected to impacts and particular areas of influence on specific global Sustainable  
Development Goals (SDGs)."
"Our corporate strategy is geared toward the SDGs especially relevant for Symrise (SDG 8, 13, 14, 15, 17)."
"For further information on our contribution to the SDGs, see our corporate website."
"As part of this effort, we will improve internal 
processes in particular by bundling procurement 
Group-wide, optimizing our warehousing operation 
and receivables management and increasingly using 
artificial intelligence (AI) in research and development."
"We are also optimizing our portfolio of raw materials 
by reducing the number of them that we use, im-
proving the yield of strategic raw materials and ex-
panding their backward integration."
"This work will 
also enable us to bolster our traceable, reliable and 
continuously high-quality supply operation."
"Back-
ward integration will also enable us to perform long-
term, socially responsible work in areas where such 
crops as vanilla, citrus fruit and patchouli are grown."
"We also increase our contribution to sustainability

Corporate strategy beyond sales growth and  
EBITDA margin: Symrise has its sights firmly set on  
nonfinancial key performance indicators."
"In this process, we analyze the needs 
and wishes of our customers and consumers around 
the world, search for products that we can use to 
achieve above-average margins thanks to our inno-
vativeness and look for products that offer new 
growth potential for us."
"To achieve these goals, we 
became the first company in our industry years ago  
to venture into related business fields."
"One example: 
While the traditional flavor and fragrance markets 
are growing very solidly at an average of 3 % to 4 % 
per year, the pet food market, for example, is grow-
ing far more significantly."
"Today, we generate more 
than 30 % of our sales in these additional application 
areas."
"We aim to increase this proportion to 50 %  
over the next few years – for the benefit of growth and 
profitability."
"Our acquisitions are contributing to  
this growth as well."
"Our integrated corporate strategy helps us grow  
dynamically, generate a high level of profitability  
and continuously improve our sustainability perfor-
mance."
"This type of holistic thinking and acting is 
part of Symrise’s DNA."
"Chemists Wilhelm Haarmann 
and Ferdinand Tiemann from Holzminden discov-
ered how to synthesize vanilla from the sap of conifers 
150 years ago."
"Soon after, they helped to build  
the aroma and fragrance industry – worldwide."
"The 
Haarmann & Reimer company and later Dragoco, 
which became part of Symrise in 2003, stood for  
innovation, creativity and sustainable use of raw ma-
terials in many areas for decades."
"Symrise continues 
to travel down this path by providing our customers 
with a comprehensive value proposition, conserving 
resources and achieving long-term business success: 
We intend to become the global market leader in  
the areas of food, beverages and pet food as we do so."
"20

Symrise thinks today about tomorrow and the day after  
tomorrow."
"And we think and act in multidimensional terms,  
considering all the interactions and connections between  
business, environment and society."
"Only in this way can we  
develop successfully and ensure that all stakeholders  
benefit from our success."
"Our value creation 
amounted to a total of € 7,082,728 billion, equating to a return 
on sales of 35.6 %."
"If we are to achieve our future goals, we must 
continue to operate sustainably and successfully."
"To this end, we 
rely on our proven and future-oriented business model, under 
which we use a variety of resources to create value for numerous 
stakeholder groups."
"We are very much aware that, as a globally active group of com-
panies, we have a responsibility to fulfill."
"It is crucial that we  
put the capital entrusted to us to profitable use, that we use the 
natural resources at the heart of our business efficiently while  
at the same time ensuring their conservation, and that we champion 
both the well-being of our employees and social causes."
"In this 
way, we can steadily increase our value creation while continuing 
to fulfill our responsibility to the environment and society."
"Symrise has a broad portfolio of more than 35,000 products, 
serving many customers all over the world who in turn  
manufacture products for consumers on every continent."
"This 
breadth of activities opens up growth opportunities, stabi- 
lizes Symrise’s business and gives the company a distinctive pro-
file."
"The teams and divisions within our two segments – Taste,  
Nutrition & Health and Scent & Care – put their commitment and 
creativity into developing innovative concepts and customized 
products."
"These products meet consumer demand for naturalness, 
traceability of ingredients, new taste and fragrance experiences, 
sustainability and health benefits."
"To achieve this, Symrise  
offers ever more comprehensive product solutions, harnesses 
synergies in research through collaboration between the divi-
sions and optimizes the use of natural ingredients in line with 
circular economy principles."
"In this way, we create tangible  
added value for all Symrise stakeholders."
"In other words, we design 
our processes in such a way that they have the least possible  
impact on the environment and allow us to fulfill our social respon-
sibility toward our employees and society."

"That makes us one of the most 
profitable companies in the industry, just like in 
previous years."
"With this performance, we are laying the foundations 
for our long-term goals, which we have set out in  
our integrated corporate strategy."
"In 2025, we aim to 
achieve sales of € 5.5 billion to € 6.0 billion with  
annual growth of 5 % to 7 %."
"But we are committed to 
achieving our goals at all levels, including with re-
gard to sustainability, where our aim is for the com-
pany as a whole to be net zero starting in 2030."

SymSafe project in 2021."
"Diversity is the foundation 
of our business operations – and sustainability, in all of its many facets,  
is an integral part of our business model, our strategy and our purpose."
"We have deeply integrated this mentality into the Group over the years: 
with committees, structures and dedicated employees."
"Four pillars for greater sustainability 
In recent years, Symrise has collected, analyzed and 
evaluated key sustainability aspects for the Group."
"We have bundled the aspects of sustainability that are 
relevant to Symrise into the four pillars of environ-
mental protection (footprint), sustainable innovation 
(innovation), raw material sourcing (sourcing) and 
employees and society (care)."
"We have drawn on these 
four pillars to formulate specific goals that we intend 
to accomplish by 2025 (see page 27)."
"Each goal has  
a direct connection to our major issues and is based 
on such programs as the United Nations’ 17 Sustain-
able Development Goals (SDGs)."
"The aims of our pillars 
are closely interwoven into our business model, a 
strategy that is based largely on a circular economy."
"In turn, this tight integration enables us to form a 
bond between our commercial success and sustain-
able company management and social acceptance."
"All are called on
All employees are urged to constantly reevaluate their 
work processes in terms of efficiency, safety and re-
source conservation, and to develop ways to improve 
them."
"A global network of more than 150 Sustain­
ability Ambassadors carries out targeted initiatives 
on energy and waste management, climate, water 
and environmental protection, and occupational health 
and safety at the company’s business locations."
"Man-
agers are responsible for integrating sustainability 
into their teams and setting clear goals."
"Sustainability 
objectives are also a component of individual goals 
for all senior executives, including the members  
of the Executive Board."
"This enables us to vigorously 
apply our sustainability strategy in all divisions."
"To complement the work performed by individual 
teams at all of our business locations, we have struc-
tured the Group in a way that further advances sus-
tainability."
"The board 
meets several times a year and is led by the Chief 
Sustainability Officer (CSO)."
"The Sustainability Board 
ensures that topics relevant to sustainability and  
issues important to key stakeholder groups along the 
entire value chain are taken into consideration."
"It 
sets sustainability objectives that are achieved directly 
in the company’s individual divisions."
"Direct respon­
sibility for strategy lies with the Chief Executive Officer 
of Symrise AG, who receives regular reports on the 
progress of all sustainability activities."
"Exceptional commitment 
Our commitment to sustainability regularly receives 
recognition."
"Symrise has earned a top position once 
again on the annual sustainability ratings issued by 
CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure  
28 
S Y M R I S E  A G
Project)."
"The company received two top “A” grades  
in the categories of climate and water and an excep-
tional “A –” in the forest category."
"The Sustainable 
Future Award 2023 given by the F.A.Z.-Institut and 
Cision Germany was also presented to Symrise for  
its exemplary activities as a sustainable company – 
and the company became the first producer in its 
sector to be certified as a B Corporation in Brazil."
"We 
are proud of these honors – they motivate us to  
become even better."
"The challenges are multiplying: 
We continue to face the negative impact of climate 
change and the decline in biodiversity."
"We must use 
resources responsibly."
"We are also still working to 
overcome the ramifications of the Covid-19 pandemic 
and Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine."
"Dialogue with all stakeholders  
We seek out conversations with all relevant stake-
holders for the purposes of positioning our company 
as broadly as possible, discussing current develop-
ments and considering the expectations that various 
stakeholders have about sustainable company man-
agement."
"Examples of this dialogue include various 
WBCSD committees, the global representative bodies 
IFRA and IOFI and such initiatives as OP2B and the 
Development and Climate Alliance."
"We also conduct 
a particularly in-depth dialogue about sustainability 
with the company’s shareholders, investors, voting 
proxies and rating agencies."
"Such rating agencies as 
MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS ESG have a high degree 
of quality and a major impact for our company re-
garding the communication of our ESG performance 
to investors."
"In addition, internationally recognized 
institutions like CDP, EcoVadis or SEDEX regularly 
grade our sustainability performance."
"This is impor­
tant because both our customers and our investors  
expect us to continuously enhance our sustainability 
reporting."
"This is the only way that we can make  
our business processes more transparent and better 
estimate the opportunities and risks of our business 
activity."

"The EU Taxonomy is an important aspect of this 
plan."
"This uniform classification system is aimed at 
channeling private and public investments in a way that 
will finance the transformation to a sustainable economy."
"Symrise has posed these questions 
to itself – and found answers: “The EU Taxonomy con-
tains precise definitions and a specific roadmap that shows 
how the economy in Europe can become more sustain-
able,” says Bernhard Kott, the Chief Sustainability Officer 
at Symrise."
"The EU has defined six overarching environmental goals 
to structure the process:
1."
"Climate change adaption 
3."
"
Sustainable use and protection of water  
and marine resources
4."
"Transition to a circular economy
5."
"Pollution prevention and control 
6."
"
Protection and restoration of biodiversity  
and ecosystems
The environmental taxonomy will be followed in the future 
by a social taxonomy that will include objectives in such 
areas as education and health."
"Aspects of good company 
management are to be integrated as well."
"“At this point, 
all of our sustainability issues that we summarize under 
the pillars of footprint, sourcing, innovation and care will 
be covered by the taxonomy,” Bernhard Kott says."
"Taxonomy-eligible versus taxonomy-aligned
The EU Taxonomy breaks down its six environmental 
goals into 16 segments that comprise a total of 230 activ-
ities."
"To meet the requirements, companies must carry 
out two different tasks per activity."
"They initially must 
identify the taxonomy-eligible commercial activities that 
affect them."
"Taxonomy-eligible means that an activity 
has the potential to help achieve one of the six environ-
mental goals."
"A company must then determine whether 
this activity is actually taxonomy-aligned, that is, if it  
is environmentally sustainable on the basis of the criteria."
"To be considered sustainable, they must apply three  
central principles:
Making sustainability
measurable
Through the introduction of the EU Taxonomy, the European 
Union has classified environmentally sustainable business activities."
"Beginning in 2023, companies must demonstrate how they will  
incorporate six environmental goals into such areas as their capital 
expenditures or production technologies."
"Because Symrise’s  
business model is sustainably structured per se, the Group must 
report and audit only a small portion of its activities."
"The company  
is well prepared for this work."
"34 
S Y M R I S E  A G
1."
"
Significant contribution: Companies must make a 
significant and measurable contribution to at  
least one of the environmental targets based on 
predefined technical criteria."
"
No damage: The principle of do no significant 
harm has been introduced to ensure that none of 
the goals has a negative impact on any of the  
five other objectives."
"For instance, climate protec-
tion measures should not have a harmful effect  
on biodiversity."
"
Minimum social standards: Even before the social 
taxonomy is adopted, companies should ensure 
that the taxonomy-eligible activities do not violate 
any minimum social standards – such as the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises or the 
U.N."
"Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights."
"Integration of the EU taxonomy and results 
The policy classifies only those activities that have the 
potential to make the greatest contribution to the  
six EU environmental targets."
"For Symrise, this means 
that only 2 % of sales and 9 % of investments are 
taxonomy-eligible."
"The difference between taxonomy- 
eligible and taxonomy-aligned is much more im-
portant."
"“A small difference between the two indicates 
that a business or investment activity has a com­
paratively high degree of environmental compatibility,” 
Bernhard Kott says."
"At Symrise, the difference is  
relatively small."
"In fiscal year 2023, it was about 2 % 
of annual sales at Symrise that were taxonomy- 
eligible and -aligned."
"Of capital expenditures (CapEx), 
9 % were taxonomy-eligible and 3 % taxonomy- 
aligned."
"The key reason for the good performance is that 
Symrise applies high standards."
"For instance, its  
environmental management system applies the stan-
dard ISO 14001."
"With SMETA, the company uses an  
audit standard of the Sedex organization to demon-
strate its compliance with requirements regarding 
human rights, the environment, health, occupational 
health and safety and business ethics."
"To ensure  
that things remain this way, Symrise has included 
taxonomy-relevant requirements in the global CapEx 
tool."
"“Sustainability is an important issue in every  
financing activity,” Bernhard Kott says."
"He adds that 
about 200 Group employees around the world have 
been trained in taxonomy-related tasks."
"Impulse for more sustainability
For Symrise, the EU Taxonomy is a time-consuming, 
but profitable responsibility."
"“We are very transparent 
about our sustainability activities,” Bernhard Kott 
says."
"“We have been reporting on the basis of all rel-
evant standards for more than 10 years now."
"We 
view these standards as both a guideline and a text-
book.” As a result, Kott welcomes the EU Taxonomy 
that much more because it facilitates uniform  
standards."
"“For many years, experts have complained 
about the lack of clear definitions for sustainable  
action,” Kott says."
“We now have comparability.
"Green­
washing is more difficult – and good sustainability 
performance has become more visible."
"For this reason, 
we do not view the EU Taxonomy as an obligation  
or burden."
"An  
overview of external ratings and rankings shows where the com­
pany achieved particular success during the past fiscal year."

Herr Dr. Bertram, das Motto des diesjährigen 
Unternehmensberichts heißt „Verantwortung 
liegt in unserer Natur“."
"In Zeiten, in denen die Welt zudem vor vielen 
anderen Herausforderungen steht, ist das gar 
nicht so einfach."
" Symrise hat immer schon Verantwortung 
übernommen, für die Mitarbeiter, die Nachbarn an 
unseren Standorten, die Menschen, die in unser Un-
ternehmen und in unsere Aktien investiert haben."
"Das war selbstverständlich, weil alle Stakeholder am 
Unternehmenserfolg teilhabensollen."
"Seit mehr als 
zehn Jahren haben wir unser Engagement noch ein-
mal massiv erweitert."
"Sehr früh schon haben wir das 
Thema Nachhaltigkeit in den Vordergrund gerückt 
und haben  ein ganz ureigenes Interesse daran: Wir 
hängen mit unseren Produkten von der Natur ab – 
und allein deswegen müssen wir uns engagieren."
" Uns geht es wie vielen anderen global  
tätigen Konzernen: Wir sind extrem getrieben durch 
die geopolitischen Verwerfungen."
"Das hat großen  
Einfluss auf unsere Lieferketten, dazu kommen die 
hohe Inflation und die Wechselkurseffekte, die  
unser organisches Wachstum mehr als halbieren."
"Dennoch haben wir unseren Umsatz organisch  
wieder gesteigert, um 7,9 % und damit über unser 
Ziel, das zwischen 5 und 7 % liegt."
"Damit sind wir  
im Branchenvergleich absolut führend."
" Wir schreiben es aufgrund der Ergebnisse 
des vergangenen Geschäftsjahrs fort und haben uns 
auch ein neues mittelfristiges Ziel bis 2028 gesetzt: 
Bis dahin wollen wir bei einer gleichbleibenden 
Marge 7,5 bis 8 Milliarden Umsatz erzielen."
"Umsatzzuwachs und Gewinn in 
einem schwierigen Wirtschafts-
umfeld, eine ganze Reihe neuer 
Nachhaltigkeitsinitiativen und 
-projekte."
"Dazu neue Wachs-
tumsziele für das Jahr 2028: Sym-
rise hat das Geschäftsjahr 2023 er-
folgreich abgeschlossen und blickt 
optimistisch in die Zukunft."
"Mal in Folge 
wachsen konnte und wie er die 
langfristige Konzernstrategie auch 
weiterhin umsetzt, sagt der Vor-
standsvorsitzende Dr. Heinz-Jürgen 
Bertram im Interview."
"Bis zum Jahr 2025 wollen Sie einen Umsatz 
zwischen 5,5 und 6 Milliarden Euro erreichen."
" Wir verfolgen weiterhin unsere Strategie, 
die auf den drei Säulen Wachstum, Effizienz und 
Portfolio beruht und untrennbar mit unseren Nach-
haltigkeitszielen verknüpft ist."
"Das Wachstum hat 
zwei Treiber: Wir wachsen auf der einen Seite organ-
isch, zum Beispiel im Bereich der Luxusparfümerie, 
wo wir immer wieder neue spannende Produkte für 
unsere global tätigen Kunden entwickeln und pro-
duzieren dürfen."
"Gleiches gilt bei Körperpflege, 
Parfümerieprodukten, Lebensmitteln und Getränken, 
bei Pet Food oder auch im Bereich Oral Care."
"Gleich-
zeitig haben wir unsere Expertise und unsere Basis 
durch Unternehmenszukäufe verbreitert."
"So haben 
wir unsere Beteiligung an dem amerikanischen Un-
ternehmen Kobo erhöht."
"Es stellt anorganische 
UV-Filter her und beschleunigt unsere globale Wach-
stumsstrategie bei kosmetischen Inhaltsstoffen."
"Weiterhin haben wir den Anteil an der Firma Swe-
dencare auf 42 % erhöht."
"This is not easy when the world is facing 
many other challenges."
" Symrise has always assumed responsibility: 
for its employees, for the neighbors of our sites  
and for the people who invest in our company and 
buy our shares."
"We considered this the right thing  
to do because we want all our stakeholders to share 
in the company’s success."
"We greatly expanded  
this commitment more than ten years ago, focusing 
on sustainability at an early stage because it is  
very much in our own interest."
"Our products depend 
on nature and we must commit to sustainability  
for this reason alone."
" We are in the same position as many other 
international companies in that we are greatly  
affected by geopolitical events."
"They have had a large 
impact on our supply chains and, coupled with high 
inflation and currency translation effects, this has 
more than halved our organic growth."
"Nevertheless, 
we were able to grow our sales organically by 7.9 %, 
thus exceeding our target of between 5 % and 7 %."
This makes us the absolute leader in our industry.
" We remain committed to this target in light 
of our performance in the past fiscal year and we’ve 
set ourselves a new mid-term target for 2028."
"By 
then, we intend to achieve sales of € 7.5 to 8 billion, 
at the same time maintaining our margin."
"Increased sales and profit in a difficult 
business environment, a number of new 
sustainability initiatives and projects 
and new growth targets for 2028: Symrise 
ended the 2023 fiscal year successfully and 
is looking ahead with optimism."
"In this 
interview, CEO Dr. Heinz-Jürgen Bertram  
explains how the company was able to 
grow for the 18th year in succession and 
how he will continue to implement the 
long-term strategy."
"You are aiming to achieve sales of between 
€ 5.5 and 6 billion by 2025."
" We are continuing to pursue our strategy 
based on the three pillars of growth, efficiency  
and portfolio, and this is linked inextricably to our 
sustainability targets."
Our growth has two drivers.
"On the one hand, we are growing organically, for  
example, in the luxury fragrance sector, where we 
continue to develop and manufacture exciting  
new products for our global customers."
"The same 
applies in the body care, fragrance products, food  
and beverages, pet food and oral care businesses."
"At 
the same time, we have expanded our expertise  
and the basis for our activities through new acquisi-
tions."
"For example, we have increased our stake  
in US company Kobo, a manufacturer of inorganic 
UV filters."
"This acquisition is enabling us to accel­
erate the implementation of our growth strategy for 
cosmetic ingredients."
"We have also increased our 
stake in Swedencare to 42 %."
"As a result of these acquisitions, the portfolio 
is shifting further away from the traditional 
flavors and fragrance businesses in which you 
built your career."
" We were the first in our industry to start 
making sensible additions to our core businesses."
"At the same time, this was the first step in the trans-
formation toward the use of natural, sustainable  
and traceable raw materials."
"We are moving fast in 
this."
"Whereas around 10 % of our business was  
outside Flavor and Fragrance in 2008, it is now more 
than 30 % – and our new target is for half of sales  
in 2028 to be achieved outside our traditional busi-
ness."
"This diversification was and is critical to  
our success."
"It is enabling us to access entirely new 
markets and sales potential, putting our business  
on a broader footing."
"At the same time, though, we

You mentioned preventive healthcare and are 
aiming to increase healthcare solutions in  
the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment."
"This shows that Symrise products are the 
result of a lot of research and development."
" For years, our portfolio has included solu-
tions such as cranberry extracts, which have a  
scientifically proven benefit and a positive effect on 
the urinary tract."
"We are now consolidating our 
knowledge of bioactives in a unit with its own strat-
egy, vision and leadership and a dedicated team  
(see page 80), which will be working intensively in this 
area where we see enormous growth opportunities."
 One trend is personalization.
"You just  
mentioned healthcare, for which we are developing 
probiotics, prebiotics and postbiotics."
"Our micro­
biome research is also delivering products tailored to 
individual users."
"The same applies to care and cos-
metic products and to food."
"Thanks to our natural 
products, our portfolio holds the best solutions in all 
these fields."
" We focus on sustainable products that  
also deliver healthy margins in the long term."
"That 
is why we only acquire companies that match  
our profitability level of around 20 % or that we can 
take to that level within three years."
"This cannot  
be achieved with mass products that have no specific 
underlying know-how."
"At the same time, innovation 
has always been in our blood."
"We are now seeking to 
strengthen our innovative capability with the IGNITE  
program that aims to accelerate research and devel-
opment (see page 104)."
"Or, specifically, we are 
growing our AgroScience activities to investigate the 
methods of farming, harvesting and processing 
plant-based raw materials (see page 98)."
" Instead of pet food, we now talk about pet 
care, which also includes dietary supplements and 
preventive healthcare solutions."
"This is evidenced by 
the investment in Swedencare, for example."
"The  
company is growing strongly and is aiming for sales of 
€ 400 million by 2026."
"Its portfolio includes oral  
care products for dogs and food products to control 
weight or improve mobility."
"Vegan protein sources  
for pet food are another focus because many dog and 
cat owners who are vegan themselves want to feed 
their animals in the same way."
"The pet market has 
been growing for years – and we are growing with it."
"are also relying on future markets, which we ana­
- 
lyze for the opportunities they harbor for us."
"One 
way of doing this is by using the trendscope study  
for the food and beverages industry (see page 74)."
"We use ­
similar market and consumer research  
tools in other areas of the company."
"Symrise is very international with more than  
100 locations worldwide."
"There is a trend  
toward deglobalization in some industries."
" The markets are still extremely volatile and 
the use of digital marketing channels is growing  
significantly."
"We need to prepare our organization for 
this and develop a certain degree of flexibility."
"How­
ever, we will continue to internationalize our business 
because we want to be close to our markets."
"It is  
the only way to really understand consumers and the 
specific characteristics of individual regions."
"At the 
same time, we procure our raw materials from all over 
the world."
Some 90 % of these are natural in origin.
"In order to monitor these materials, ensure their avail­
ability and purchase sustainably, it’s important to  
be present."
"This is something we demonstrate in many 
instances."
"For example, in Madagascar, we work  
very closely with the small farmers that supply us 
(see page 54)."

Adjusted for one-time effects
You just mentioned digitalization."
"Let’s now turn to the company’s internal 
development."
"You’ve made a number  
of changes to the Executive Board."
"We’ve talked about the present and the  
future, but the past will also play a big role in 
2024."
"It was 150 years ago that chemists 
Wilhelm Haarmann and Ferdinand Tiemann 
first synthesized vanillin in Holzminden, 
thus laying the foundation for Symrise."
"The most important change on the Executive 
Board will be the transfer of CEO responsibility 
to Jean-Yves Parisot."
" It’s helping us to meet our customers’ ex-
pectations."
"For example, we are increasing our use of 
artificial intelligence to optimize our fragrance com­
positions."
"The fundamental decisions are made by our 
perfumers, but we can make the upstream process 
more efficient by using AI to suggest certain parame-
ters during fragrance development."
"However, these 
innovative technologies aren’t only helping us in prod-
uct creation."
"In the years ahead, we will be applying 
them to a growing extent in increasing efficiency – the 
third pillar of our corporate strategy."
"To this end, we 
will be implementing digital solutions in production 
and our supply chains, for example."
"That is how we 
aim to become more efficient."
" At the start of the year, Dr. Jörn Andreas 
took over as head of the Scent & Care segment, which 
I was in charge of temporarily for a year-and-a-half."
"He previously headed the Cosmetic Ingredients divi-
sion."
"His appointment makes optimal use of our 
management resources."
"The company is growing fast 
and there is a lot to do."
"This is also the case in the 
Human Resources and Legal department, which is 
now headed by Dr. Stephanie Coßmann."
"She was 
previously a member of the Board of Management 
and Labor Director of Lanxess AG and will be shaping 
our human resource strategy for the future (see  
interview page 92)."
"With this strategy, we aim to at-
tract the best talents and develop our employees."
" Our history is very important to us because 
it’s a story of inventiveness and responsibility."
"Symrise 
was created in 2003 from the merger of Dragoco and 
Haarmann & Reimer, two Holzminden-based compa-
nies with long traditions."
"In 1874, Wilhelm Haarmann 
collaborated with Ferdinand Tiemann to develop  
a process for manufacturing vanillin from the sap of 
conifer trees, matching the natural flavor of vanilla."
He established the company one year later.
"Dragoco, 
on the other hand, first saw success in fragrances  
in 1919."
"Both companies were pioneers in their fields 
and industry leaders from the start."
"We are building 
on this heritage through our sustainable and success-
ful research and business activities."
" In fact, after 21 intensive years with the 
company, 19 of them on the board and 15 as CEO, I am 
retiring at the end of March 31st."
"I am proud of the 
things we accomplished together during these 21 years: 
Symrise has grown."
Continuously and profitably.
"Today, Symrise stands for ingenuity, the very highest 
quality and absolute reliability in our industry."
"This  
is primarily the result of the hard work done by our 
tremendous team."
"It was an honor to lead this team 
during these eventful years."
"Now is the right time to 
pass on the baton."
"Symrise will be in the very best 
hands under the guidance of Jean-Yves Parisot."
"We 
have known each other for years."
"I have the utmost 
respect for him both as a manager and a human be-
ing."
"He was one of the key architects of Symrise’s 
far-reaching strategic focus in recent years."
"You can 
expect continuity from him."
"But it is also clear that 
my successor will set new priorities."
"And this is exactly 
as it should be."

The pet market has been 
growing for years – and  
we are growing with it."

For years now, Symrise has been setting ambitious sustainability goals and 
then reaching them well ahead of schedule."
"In 2023, the Group continued 
to work intensively in the four areas of footprint, sourcing, innovation and 
care, Chief Sustainability Officer Bernhard Kott explains in the following 
interview."
"From protecting the climate and environment to assuming social 
responsibility and practicing good corporate governance, Symrise is focused 
on its entire value chain."

Mr. Kott, Symrise has been basing its activities 
on the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals for many years now."
Symrise is a huge business group.
" We broke down our sustainability activities 
into the four areas of footprint, sourcing, innovation 
and care."
"We transparently meet all SDGs in each  
of these categories."
"We are active in the entire range 
of issues because we are determined to become 
more sustainable."
"At the same time, we certainly want 
to remain commercially successful and be socially  
accepted."
"We focused last year on the issues of climate 
and supply chains."
" The headquarters in Holzminden is large and 
diverse."
"80 % of all technologies that we use in the 
entire Group is located here."
"Holzminden serves as 
something of a blueprint for Symrise."
"We have iden­
tified the processes here that emit the most CO2."
"We 
have analyzed the current state and the future  
of energy-production technologies as well as price 
trends for electricity, gas and hydrogen."
"Based on 
this research, we drew up a concept that will enable 
us to hit our climate targets and calculated invest-
ments in higher-impact sustainability technologies."
"In the process, we will reduce our use of oil and  
gas, electrify our operations to the greatest degree 
possible and stop emitting CO2 by 2045."
" We intend to be completely climate neutral 
by 2045, and this includes raw materials that  
we source from suppliers."
"We plan to reduce our 
Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions to such  
a low level that we will be climate neutral in this 
area in 2030."
"By that point, we intend to lower  
our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, the segment 
that encompasses the emissions that occur during 
raw material production and transport, by 30 % 
compared with 2020."
"These levels are linked to the 
targets of the Executive Board and the next  
management levels to create a financial incentive."
Let’s start with the climate.
"47 
M A G A Z I N E
Symrise wants to be  
net zero in terms  
of Scope 1 and Scope 2."
" For years now, we have been doing the same 
thing that every household does: We cut our use  
of electricity wherever we can, from offices to plants."
"In our production operation, we can take other  
approaches as well."
"In many cases, we use steam at 
30 bar pressure in our processes."
"But, for some processes, you only need steam  
at three or eight bar pressure."
"We can produce  
this steam with an electrode boiler."
"We are taking a  
similar approach with heat, an area where we have 
switched to heat pumps just like private households."
"You could not have done this on an industrial scale  
a few years ago."
"But the technological progress made 
since then has created all sorts of new alternatives."
"Symrise faces a challenge: It intends to grow 
and will grow."
"By 2028 – the new long-term  
goal – you want to generate sales of between 
€ 7.5 billion and € 8 billion."
" We are confident that the current measures 
we have taken will enable us to save tremendous 
amounts of energy, something that we can also scale."
"We also think that energy-generating technologies 
and the technologies that we use in our processes will 
become increasingly more efficient."
"Long range,  
we also have completely new forms of energy on our 
radar, things like developments in hydrogen technol-
ogies."
We are intensively monitoring them.
"We are 
planning to have made huge strides in this area by 
2040 – we will not include hydrogen in our planning 
until then."
 The pilot project has been completed.
"We are 
now rolling it out at all locations."
"We will conduct  
the same analyses and assessments everywhere and 
then introduce measures to address the individual 
situation."
"In step one, we will take a look at those loca-
tions where we can quickly prevent the most emis-
sions."
"This will be good for the climate and for us, too, 
because we can lower long-term costs."
"With Germany 
and the United States, we cover 75 % of all CO2 
emissions right now."
"We will tackle the rest of the 
world at a later stage, but in a very timely fashion."
"You just mentioned electrification, an area 
that is seen as a key weapon in the battle 
against climate change."
" We have to create a smart system whose 
features are intelligently based on one another."
"As part of this effort, we are using solar energy to 
generate electricity wherever we have large areas  
of space."
"In Germany, we are talking about the halls 
used by our logistics operation."
"But, above all, we 
are taking this approach in countries that get tremen-
dous amounts of sunshine."
"We have installed a 
4,800 square-meter photovoltaic system in our plant 
in Granada, Spain."
"This system can generate up to  
1.6 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year."
"This is 
enough to meet 15 % of the production operation’s 
power needs."
"Producing energy where it functions is 
a good lever for us."
"But the energy we produce our-
selves will not meet our total demand."
"This is why we 
continue to purchase electricity."
"We have been ex­
clusively using green power around the world since 
2020."
"The second major issue in 2023 was supply 
chains."
" We launched the sweeping program called 
“Houston” last year in the Taste, Nutrition & Health 
segment (see page 70)."
"In this work, we plan to ana-
lyze and assess emissions that arise on the product 
basis."
"We have to look very deeply into the value chain 
in this process."
"This also involves water consump-
tion that we are directly recording."
"We are talking 
about scarce resources here."
"Starting in 2024, we have 
to base our reporting on the new CSRD Directive."
"This 
makes water consumption a higher priority."
" Last year, we focused closely on the natural 
raw materials that are essential to our company."
"We have had a very good overview of the challenges 
we face in various countries and regions for a long 
time."
"For this reason, it was not hard for us to include 
sourcing practices and human rights in our materiality 
analysis as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence 
Act requires."
"» 
We have had a very good  
overview of the challenges  
we face in various  
countries and regions  
for a long time."
" Over the past few years, we have set up 
teams that examined the issues of health, safety  
and overall work conditions among suppliers – and 
focused in particular on the so-called vulnerable 
groups."
"In our case, we are talking about very many 
small farmers who possess little and earn little."
"We collected data on more than 20,000 suppliers, 
structured it and evaluated it on the basis of our 
Supplier Code of Conduct."
"By the way, we posted the 
code in various languages on our website."
 It involved a whole lot of work.
"You can see 
what I mean by looking at the small farmers again."
"They frequently do not own a computer, only smart-
phones."
"As a result, they cannot even express their 
consent to our Code of Conduct in writing."
"For this 
reason, our employees drove to them, inspected 
their work conditions and documented them."
"The 
results of this multi-stage process have to be orga-
nized in a way that enables them to be audited."
"But 
one finding really pleased us: There were just a  
few cases where we needed to make improvements."

" We devoted a very large amount of time  
to the topic of the CSRD in 2023."
"The area of double

"This 
means that we have to report not only on the way that 
our business activities impact people and the envi-

sues on our company."
There is no doubt about it.
This will require a lot of work on the one hand.
"On the 
other, we have been reporting very transparently  
on our sustainability performance for a long time, in 
part because we want our customers to gain an un-
derstanding of the impact that our products have on 
the environment."
"Apart from that, we are happy to 
take on the great amount of work involved."
"We must stop climate change – and Symrise  
has been doing its part for years."
"Last year, the focal issue was the circular economy."
" The circular economy continues to be one 
of the core focal points of our sustainability activities."
"We work in all areas to do such things as use packag-
ing materials as smartly as possible – through the  
selection of materials or innovative ways to pack prod-
ucts."
"The Pet Food division shows us how the circular 
economy works regarding the use of raw materials."
"Virtually all raw materials used here come from side 
streams or other production operations or reuse."
"We will continue to take this approach, throughout 
the entire Group."
"Let’s talk about occupational health and safety 
for a moment."
"Symrise has done somewhat 
poorly here in recent years."
" Yes, we have made tremendous progress."
"We launched our Symsafe initiative in 2022 to improve 
our performance in terms of occupational health  
and safety."
"In the process, we improved our MAQ level 
– this is a German metric that is used to measure  
the number of occupational accidents with at least one 
lost day per million hours worked."
"We have lowered 
the level from 2.8 to 2.3."
We intend to reach 2.2 this year.
"Our mid-range goal is to decrease it below 1.5 and 
keep it there."
"As part of the Symsafe initiative, we ap-
pointed occupational health and safety officers around 
the world and introduced a series of rules and mea-
sures that apply to the everyday workplace."

150 years ago, one of the co-founders of Haarmann &  
Reimer – a predecessor of Symrise – synthesized vanillin 
for the first time."
"This was the start of a success story  
spanning almost one-and-a-half centuries of innovation 
and high-quality products."
"The company will therefore  
be celebrating a special anniversary in 2024, looking back 
at the past but also fixing its sights firmly on the future."

 When chemists Wilhelm Haarmann and 
Ferdinand Tiemann synthesized vanillin for the first 
time in 1874, they could not have known that this 
would be the cornerstone for a global enterprise."
"Yet 
their product was indeed very special."
"It could be 
used in place of vanilla – the costly queen of spices – 
in some applications, making this flavor affordable 
and accessible to a broader consumer group."
"The two scientists used a natural raw material that  
the company still uses today, extracting the vanillin 
in several stages from the sap of conifers."
"While  
Tiemann went on to work in academia, Haarmann 
laid the cornerstone for Symrise."
"He established  
his first company in 1875, joining Karl Ludwig Reimer 
one year later to form Haarmann & Reimer."
"The second predecessor of Symrise was also estab-
lished in Holzminden."
"In 1919, hairdresser Carl-  
Wilhelm Gerberding founded Dragoco to manufac-
ture perfume and soap compositions."
"The two  
companies evolved in parallel, went international 
and merged in 2003 to create what was then the 
world’s fourth largest supplier of fragrances and fla-
vorings."
"Since its public listing in 2006, the company 
has continued to grow and move into new areas."
"In doing so, Symrise has focused on sustainability, de-
veloping an extensive strategy for this as early as 
2005 that it has expanded massively in recent years."
And so the company has come full circle.
"Now, as in 
1874, nature is the foundation of Symrise’s business, 
enabling it to continue operating both sustainably 
and successfully in the future as well."
"1874

The Symrise Group arose 
through the merger of 
Haarmann & Reimer and 
Dragoco."
"In December, Symrise 
conducted an initial public 
offering on the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange."
"It was 
the largest IPO of the year."
"Carl-Wilhelm Gerberding 
and August Bellmer  
established the company 
named Dragoco, an  
enterprise that went on  
to become one of the 
world’s leading providers 
of elegant fragrance  
compositions."
"The founders of  
Haarmann & Reimer  
discovered a way  
to synthesize aromatic 
vanillin."
"They built

 Symrise procures only natural products 
from Madagascar."
"We started with vanilla and  
have expanded our portfolio to 36 products since 
2014."
"These products are broken down into three 
groups."
"First, we purchase our blockbusters there, 
things like vanilla pods as well as mandarin,  
patchouli, geranium and vetiver oils."
"Second, our 
grand crus: high-quality products that are tailored  
just for Symrise, including oils made of longoza, 
pink-pepper leaf, ylang-ylang and cinnamon."
"Third, 
we develop innovative products there, products in 
which we combine traditional techniques like enfleu-
rage and modern technologies like CO2 extraction."
"Symrise has been purchasing vanilla in Madagascar  
for years."
"Roughly 10 years ago, the company  
updated its procurement strategy on the island in  
the Indian Ocean and formed a network of about 
7,000 farmers who produce 36 raw materials and profit  
in many different ways from this partnership."
"During  
that same time, Symrise started its own experimental 
farm, expanded its production operation, achieved  
additional sustainability in agriculture on many levels 
and forged a fair partnership with the farmers."
"A  
glimpse at a unique value chain."

and FloCert."
"As an active member of UEBT, we  
act as an advocate of sustainable farming practices."
"Tremendous benefits for all divisions
Our raw materials are prized by both Symrise seg-
ments."
"An example: The Food & Beverage division uses 
ginger oil, while the Cosmetic Ingredients division 
­
relies on powdered ginger."
"One of the three pillars of 
our perfume raw materials specialist, Maison Lautier, 
is already dedicated to our natural substances port­
folio, as is one of the four pillars of the Naturals busi-
ness unit."
"More raw materials, innovative technologies
This also means that we will have to maintain stable 
supplies in the future in spite of market fluctuations."
"We will secure supplies by drawing on our network  
of small vanilla farmers."
"We are also planning to add 
other special raw materials to our portfolio and apply 
innovative processing technologies."
"We prioritize 
sustainability as well: This focus starts with local pro-
duction in Madagascar and extends to our efforts  
to upcycle individual raw materials for certain uses 
on a cross-divisional basis."
"A focus on ethical procurement
While performing this work, we take steps to ensure 
that all procurement sources are ethically impeccable."
"This is a commitment that we clearly defined in the 
strategy we developed 10 years ago."
"We can trace the 
journey of every raw material back to the farm where 
it was produced."
"The well-being of farmers’ families  
is one of our major concerns."
"We also maintain and 
regenerate biological diversity on the farms and pro-
tect the environment by sustainably using plants."
"We apply the Symrise Sustainability Strategy and com-
ply with the Nagoya Protocol, which provides a frame-
work for access to genetic resources and is intended  
to ensure fair benefit sharing for the countries in which 
the raw materials grow."
"Our products are certified  
on the basis of the standards set by Organic, COSMOS, 
Fair Trade, Fair For Life and UEBT."
"These certifica-
tions apply to both cultivation and production facilities."
"We work together with the farmers to always devel­
op 
fast, pragmatic solutions."

40,000 people profit
We partner with about 7,000 farmers who, on average, 
cultivate one hectare of land."
"They grow vanilla on 
one half and food, crops and firewood on the other 
half."
"The farmers have been certified by the UEBT/
Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade Organic or Fair For Life 
Organic."
"The farmers’ families comprise a total of 
about 40,000 people, and these people benefit from 
our partnership."
"We also strive to increase the role  
of women in this work – women now run about 28 %  
of the farms."
"We also support the next generation  
of farmers."
"Teaching more sustainable farming practices
One focal point of our work is to teach better and more 
sustainable farming practices to farmers."
"We have 
set up an agro-innovation center in Benavony for this 
purpose."
"We conduct research there into such topics 
 
as organic disease and pest control to improve the 
health of soil and make vanilla vines less susceptible to 
disease."
"We also promote agro-forest systems where 
food and fragrance raw materials that are impor­
tant to 
us, like patchouli, are grown."
"The knowledge of the 
farmers is also very helpful to us."
"Together with the 
results produced in test operations, this knowledge 
leads to new farming practices."
" Symrise purchases its raw materials in the 
SAVA region but also in other areas in the north of  
the island."
"Some of the farming areas are in very re-
mote locations and are difficult to reach on the dirt 
roads that lead to and from them."
"But the broad ex-
panse of the locations on the island pays off in one 
major way: We can keep our customers supplied with 
products even if natural events cause crop failures."
"It’s very unlikely that typhoons will hit every corner 
of the island during a single season."

Support on all levels
The partnership is strong."
"But the challenges faced 
by farmers remain large."
"The country has hardly  
any infrastructure, like roads, schools and hospitals."
"The infrastructure that does exist is in poor condi-
tion."
"It lacks social safety nets like insurance or gov-
ernment disaster-relief funds that are provided in  
the aftermath of natural catastrophes."
"Most of the 
farms are also so small that the farmers can hardly 
earn a living from them."
"Our network helps farmers 
increase their productivity and tap several sources  
of income so that they are able to get through crises 
more easily."
"As part of this effort, we work with them 
to develop various value chains, purchase products  
at different times of year to ensure that they have an 
income throughout the year and pay prices that  
cover the sustainable production costs."
"We help them 
go into aquaculture, beekeeping and poultry farming."
We also distribute seeds and seedlings to the farmers.
"Sustainable support for a better future 
One other top priority is to teach farmers to manage 
their budget and savings in order to pay off their 
debts."
"More than 20,000 people now have health  
insurance thanks to our efforts."
"We have about 
7,000 farmers in the farm management program and 
have trained about 11,000 in good farming practices."
"We also help about 90 parent groups purchase basic 
educational materials for elementary schools and  
pay the salaries of additional teachers."
"We have also 
set up five training centers where young people  
can learn to become farmers."
"We will continue to carry 
out this work because it enables us to achieve  
several goals at once."
"We are committed to further 
strengthening the position of the farmers, easing  
the pressure on the soil and nature reserves with their 
sweeping array of biodiversity and teaching even 
more efficient farming practices."
"We move closer to 
achieving our sustainability goals by doing so."

 In Madagascar, Symrise produces a broad 
range of products that includes the raw materials 
grown by small farmers in the region."
"The process 
works very well."
"But we have learned over the  
years that farmers cannot or do not want to cultivate  
certain plants."
There are many reasons why.
"Some 
farmers may view planting certain trees as too risky 
because they have no experience with them."
"Exam­
-
ples of these plants include bay, ylang-ylang and citrus 
trees."
"Some farmers prefer to grow only vanilla  
because it has the highest yield."
"Madagascar is also 
subject to crop-damaging typhoons."
"We have to 
broadly position our raw-material supply operation 
as a result."
"The valuable green vanilla pods are 
harvested, fermented and converted 
into many different products."
"Palma rosa is an  
aromatic grass that  
is used to produce 
fragrances."
"59

Four farming operations 
But demand for high-quality and traceable products is 
high."
"We set up our own farm with four individual 
farming operations to respond to it."
"“La Ferme des 
Hauts,” the largest farming operation, uses tractors 
and irrigation systems for the purpose of maintaining 
the biological diversity between wetlands, forests 
and fallow land."
"We plant natural barriers to prevent 
soil erosion between parcels of land, operate a  
composting facility and rehabilitate the soil."
"We also 
cultivate such aromatic plants as ylang-ylang, palma 
rosa, lemongrass, vetiver, bay  and pink pepper."
"At the 
“Ambodipont Farm,” we grow acacia and eucalyptus 
trees."
"We use the renewable wood from these trees 
to fire the boilers in our factory – and we run our 
“Torsten Farm” to gain experience with the cultivation 
of citrus trees."
"Role model for regenerative farming 
We also plant new cultures like tuberose, Orris root, 
cosmos and Chinese raspberry, so we can determine 
their suitability for the region, define the standards  
we must apply and learn how we can process these 
plants."
"In addition, we are testing various irrigation 
and composting systems that could be used to im-
prove the quality of soil without applying any chemical 
supplements."
"We are also working on mechanical 
harvesting methods for such things as vetiver roots 
to increase yields per hectare."
"Everyone profits
We all profit from our farms: the farmers, the environ-
ment and Symrise."
"The farmers have to take less  
risk and can learn from us."
"The environment profits 
because we are adapting to climate changes, in-
creasing biodiversity, setting up agroforestry culti-
vation systems and regenerating the soil."
"Symrise 
profits as well because we can provide our customers 
with sustainable production that is based on quality, 
quantity and total traceability."
"Thierry Bernard,

The essential oil from the 
ylang-ylang plant is widely

Analysis and processing 
All products delivered to us pass through a precisely 
defined process."
"We analyze them with the help of 
gas chromatographs to identify individual elements."
"Accepted qualities are filtered with high-perfor-
mance materials and packed in containers."
"Our prod-
ucts are also UEBT and/or Bio and Cosmos certified."
"The factory is approved as a halal and kosher factory 
as well."
"What’s more, we continuously expand our 
technologies."
"These additions include new drying and 
CO2 extraction facilities and a Symtrap® column."
"This patented process enables us to use side streams 
from plant processing to achieve higher quality or 
yields."
"One example of this is vetiver oil, one of the 
biggest selling products in the Symrise Fragrance  
division."
"Plans for the future
We have many plans for the years to come."
"We want 
to use enfleurage technology to create additional 
flowery accents."
"In this process, petals are placed on 
fat and their scents diffuse into it."
"Maison Lautier – 
our natural perfume branch in France – extracts the 
scents and then processes them."
"We are also devel-
oping niche products by extracting unusual wild 
flowers through the use of supercritical carbon dioxide."
One of our highest priorities is long-term thinking.
Our region has virtually no industrial infrastructure.
"This means that we need a long lead time regarding  
repairs and new acquisitions."
"We have gained addition-
al energy independence by erecting a solar park – 
and we are also reducing our carbon footprint in the 
process."

 For the past 10 years, we have been running 
our own production operation, an activity that has 
changed enormously during this time."
"In the beginning, 
we only extracted vanilla pods that had been grown 
and fermented here on the island."
"Since then, we have 
added a broad range of new technologies and pro-
cesses and expanded our portfolio while doing so."
"Much more than vanilla 
We produce vanilla extracts for the Symrise segment 
Taste, Nutrition & Health, extracts for our Fragrance 
division and essential and plant oils and dried ginger."
"In addition to vanilla extraction, we have set up a 
distillery in which we primarily produce vetiver and 
longoza oils."
"We dry ginger rhizom there and store 
various essential oils supplied by farmers from the 
region."
"We have also expanded the factory and created 
an area where we can receive and sort plant mate­
rial."
"We process the dried ginger in another area of the 
production operation."

 If you ask a perfumer what fragrance they 
wouldn’t want to do without, the reply is often the 
same: musk."
"It certainly is omnipresent, commonly 
found in the most popular blends of fine fragrances 
and in household products."
"This also applies to its use 
in detergents, for example."
"“Musk deposits the fra-
grances in a towel so that it still smells fresh weeks 
after being washed,” explains the head of chemical 
production."
"He is responsible for the Symrise produc-
tion operations in Holzminden (Germany), Granada 
(Spain), Bushy Park, Colonels Island and Jacksonville 
(all USA) as well as Monterrey (Mexico)."
"Peter Esser has been working with fragrance molecules 
for decades."
"He and his team are always finding  
new ways to make their production more efficient and 
more sustainable."
"And now Symrise has also made 
great advances with musk fragrances."
"At the Bushy 
Park plant in South Carolina, Peter Esser has devel-
oped and optimized the production technology of the 
well-known and biodegradable musk fragrance  
Globanone® so that almost no waste results from its 
manufacture."
"“The process dates back to our work  
in the late 1990s, and we first produced Globanone® 
in 2002 in Bushy Park,” recalls Esser."
"The decisive 
step is the metathesis reaction, which makes com­
plex synthesis possible in just a few steps and there-
fore requires fewer resources and gives off fewer 
byproducts."
"Symrise has significantly expanded its production of the musk  
fragrance ingredient Globanone® at its US plant in Bushy  
Park (South Carolina)."
"The team used the principles of green 
chemistry to adapt and improve the processes to more  
efficiently manu­
facture the product, thereby making it more  
sustainable."

clear reduction in water consumption."
"Both have 
been achieved."
"Symrise uses what is known as vapor 
recompression to recover evaporation heat."
"This 
means that much less external energy is required and 
far less water is used."
"“The first stage of our pro­
duction is free of process wastewater."
"We are currently 
working on solutions for the further stages in order  
to eliminate the very small amounts of wastewater,” 
says Dr. Tom Brunzel."
"All these steps mean that Globanone® can be pro-
duced with virtually zero waste."
"“Globanone® works 
on both a sensory and a practical level,” says Peter  
Esser."
"“Our perfumers have told us that the fragrance 
molecule gives a warm, velvety and long-lasting 
musk note."
"It lifts other fragrances but doesn’t over-
power them."
"It also offers substance, stability and 
volume.” The investment in Bushy Park has been very 
worthwhile, says Esser – both for the product and 
the environment."
"The original system had been designed with expan-
sion in mind."
"“The demand for Globanone® has 
steadily increased since then, and so we continued 
to develop production plans and are now working 
with three times the capacity,” says Esser."
"It is impor­
tant to the chemist, however, that Symrise think  
beyond emissions when planning expansion."
"“We al-
ways have an eye on optimizing the process as well.” 
In the case of Globanone®, this means that Symrise 
has improved the already extremely effective process 
based on the twelve principles of green chemistry."
"But optimizing an established, successful process is 
not easy."
"“We are on a constant learning curve that 
has enabled us over the years to greatly enhance our 
understanding of how certain technologies func-
tion,” says Dr. Tom Brunzel, manager at Bushy Park 
for the last year."
"The 32-year-old was involved with 
Globanone® during his doctorate and enjoys tinkering 
with processes to make them better."
"“For example, 
we still use the same catalyst as before, but use far 
less material,” he explains, describing one of their 
successes."
"The consumption of solvents has fallen drastically, 
and the solvents used are now based on renewable 
raw materials."
"“We can also recycle both solvents  
by condensing them from the gas byproducts and 
keeping them in the cycle,” says Brunzel, explaining 
another benefit."
"Other decisive factors for process 
improvement are efficient energy recovery and a

 Granada is one of Europe’s sunniest cities."
"The sun shines nearly seven hours a day there, in the 
southern Spanish region of Andalusia."
"To make the 
most of this sunshine, Symrise installed photovoltaic 
modules on the roofs of the fragrance plant that it 
acquired in 2021."
"From a bird’s eye view, the sight is 
pretty impressive: The 4,800 square-meter system 
produces circa 1,600,000 kilowatt hours of power  
annually – enough to supply 385 German four-member 
households for a full year."
"The photovoltaic system 
meets 15 % of the power needs of the fragrance pro-
duction operation."
"The system in Spain is one of hundreds of steps that 
Symrise will take in coming years to reduce its CO2 
emissions."
"“We formulated our climate strategy back 
in 2010, and we were one of the first companies  
to do so,” says Dr. Helmut Frieden, Vice President for 
Corporate Sustainability at Symrise."
"“At the time,  
we set the goal of cutting our CO2 emissions by one-
third by 2020."
"For Scope 3, which covers climate-damaging 
gases in the upstream and downstream supply  
chain, the company is working to reach the below-2-­
degree goal, Helmut Frieden says."
"By 2030, the 
Group aims to be climate neutral in Scope 1 and 2 and  
have reduced emissions by 30 % for Scope 3 –  
the entire Group should be climate neutral by 2045."
"Climate protection is important to Symrise and its 
business model."
"“We source most of our raw mate-
rials directly from nature."
"For this reason, it is only 
natural for us to protect the climate and foster bio­
diversity,” Helmut Frieden says."
"To achieve these goals, the sustainability team in 
Holzminden has worked closely with the company’s 
locations in Germany to plan future years and de-
cades and set investment totals."
"Initially, some rela-
tively simple steps are to be taken."
"Things like  
installing photovoltaic systems and switching the 
company’s fleet to electric vehicles."
"After that, the 
techno­
logically challenging part begins."
"“We plan  
The entire Symrise Group will be climate neutral  
in 2045."
"As it works to reach this objective,  
the company has taken action around the world  
and at all of its business locations to reduce  
CO2 emissions."
"The basis of these efforts is the  
company’s Low Carbon Transition Plan that  
applies to a wide range of areas."

to electrify our production operation in order to give 
up fossil fuels like natural gas,” Helmut Frieden says."
"Part of this transition involves installing electrode 
boilers for high-pressure steam networks or industrial 
heat pumps, among other things."
"But the planning  
extends much further than this."
"“We have also included 
the industrial-scale use of hydrogen in our plans, 
even though there are no networks for it right now,” 
Frieden says."
"“But we are confident that we can  
get started in 15 years.” The sustainability manager 
thinks the plans can be realized if Symrise contin- 
ues to steadily grow as it has in the past."
"“We have 
directly included higher production volumes in  
order to be prepared for the future.” The investments 
are high, Frieden stresses."
"“But the investments  
will quickly pay for themselves in many places because 
we will take certain actions, such as sharply lowering 
our energy and CO2 costs,” he notes."
"The activities carried out in Germany will now be 
rolled out worldwide."
"The first step in this process will 
identify the locations with the highest emission levels."
"Production operations in the United States cause 
more than half of all CO2 emissions."
"The next focal 
point is to be set there."
"Germany ranks second due  
to the size of the plants at the company’s headquar-
ters."
It is followed by Ecuador and Mexico.
"“We are 
now setting the exact amounts of investment by 
identifying the business locations with the highest 
optimization potential,” Helmut Frieden says."
"France, where the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment 
primarily operates numerous plants, ranks fourth."
"From here, in Rennes in Brittany, Thierry Lenice reviews 
the plans."
"“We will start with our plants in the United 
States, Mexico and China and then quickly integrate  
all remaining production operations,” the Low Carbon 
Transition Manager says."
"He also works intensely 
with Scope 3, the core of which focuses on the carbon 
footprint of raw materials."
"“About 80 % of green-
house gases are created during the production and 
transport of our natural substances,” Thierry Lenice 
says."
"One focal area is the recipes for products whose  
life cycle was analyzed by his team in recent years."
"In addition to other aspects, this includes environ-
mental impacts such as emissions of CO2 equivalents."
"To illustrate his point, Thierry Lenice has placed two 
glasses of a soft drink in front of him."
"One beverage 
is the original version."
"The other is a refined version 
made with an optimized recipe that is designed to 
reduce the carbon footprint of the entire product."
"“In 
the past, we used pure orange extract for this soft 
drink,” the manager says."
"“We have now changed the 
flavoring ingredients by using a different mixture."
We previously used 100 % orange extract from Brazil.
"We changed the recipe to include 20 % domestic 
mushroom extract that contributes the same texture 
and the same flavor.” Both products are totally natural, 
taste the same – and the new mixture produces  
fewer greenhouse gases along the entire value chain."
"With the help of this eco-design, emissions can be 
reduced by an average of 30 %."
"As part of this effort, 
Thierry Lenice also focuses on local producers."
"“We 
work closely with them,” he says."
"“On the one hand, 
we assess their efforts to reduce our carbon foot-
print and, on the other hand, consider ways that we 
can help them become more sustainable,” Thierry 
Lenice says."
"But he adds that the suppliers who work 
with thousands of small farmers face some challenges 
in this effort."
"“Due to their size alone, it is not easy 
for many of them to meet and document the stan-
dards,” he says."
"Lenice considers this type of collabo-
ration to be especially important."
"“We live from  
agriculture and obtain our raw materials there,” he 
says."
"“By playing an active role here, we can pull  
the right levers and make our products more sustain-
able.”

 In the early 1960s, the Lyndon B."
"Johnson 
Space Center, the command center of the US space 
program, made its home in the city of Houston, Texas, 
in the United States."
"Humanity has made great 
strides with Houston in control, for example the first 
manned flight to the moon and space shuttle launches 
into outer space."
"Houston has become a symbol for 
well-conceived, tightly organized projects – and that 
is what Symrise is counting on with its Houston  
program, which began in 2023."
"The objective here, 
however, is not to reach the moon – it’s to find a 
path to greater sustainability for the entire Group."
"“As is the case with space travel, we divided the 
Houston program into three phases that build upon 
one another and are designed to make Symrise  
more sustainable on multiple levels,” says Claire Du 
Peloux."
"A native of France, Du Peloux is heading up  
the project and oversees a team that is spread across 
functions, regions and organizational units."
"She  
has worked in Symrise’s finance and controlling depart-
ment in Rennes since 2010, in the Taste, Nutrition & 
Health segment, and joined the sustainability team 
two years ago."
"During the Ignition phase, which  
was finalized in January 2024, the team gathered data 
and facts to understand the needs and priorities  
of internal and external stakeholders."
"Based on this 
input, they decided on a way forward, and built a 
concrete roadmap to shape the company’s vision."
"This 
first phase entailed, among others things, the defi­
nition of global business requirements and the identi-
fication of technical IT solutions that could deliver  
on them."
"The Lift-off phase will then be dedicated to 
testing the chosen IT platform throughout spring 
2024."
"Finally, the Orbit phase will support the tool’s 
rollout within the whole Group by the end of 2025."
The project started with intensive research.
"“We sur-
veyed stakeholders on all levels – here in the Group, 
but also our sustainability colleagues at our customers, 
for example,” Claire Du Peloux explains."
"Indeed, more and 
more customers are inquiring about the carbon foot-
print of their products."
"“They want to know what  
the figures show today, but they also want to see our 
roadmap for decarbonization,” Claire Du Peloux  
says."
"Just like Symrise, all companies of a certain size 
have written out their climate targets."
"“Global  
customers are passing the pressure on to suppliers, 
expecting us to move on from pledge to plan."
"This is 
why we have to measure, track and analyze our 
footprint from Group view down to product level in 
order to design and offer to our customers – as 
much as possible – low-carbon and, in a second step, 
low-water alternatives."
"User-friendliness, data  
accuracy and safety are key criteria for the new tool.”
Laure Vassel was also involved in the 50 interviews 
with 140 stakeholders."
"She has worked for the com­
pany since the beginning of 2022 and is involved in the 
Houston program as a business sustainability ana-
lyst."
"“By 2030, we plan to reduce our Scope 3 emis-
sions (e.g., the emissions linked to the cultivation, 
production and transport of the company’s purchased 
raw materials) by 30 %,” Laure Vassel says."
"“To this 
end, we touched on all parts of the value chain in our

interviews, as all business areas have their role to play."
"From alternative sourcing, innovative recipes, more 
efficient production processes and clever solutions in 
logistics, the whole Symrise organization and up-
stream value chain has a part to play,” she says, listing 
numerous reduction levers."
"This collective effort  
is of paramount importance, as purchased products 
represent 85 % of our emissions today."
"Laure Vassel also makes it clear that, although corpo-
rate targets are set at a global level and apply all 
around the globe across all divisions, the challenges 
to reach them may vary greatly."
"“The Houston pro-
gram won’t churn out a one-size-fits-all solution."
"“With the Houston 
program, our aim is to build up cohesion within the 
Group and become a geared team for greater sustain-
ability around the world.” Sustainability should be 
the focus of the global value promise, and Symrise 
should remain a pioneer in the industry and business."
"The project team is aware that a deep mindset change 
is required for this tool to reach its objective."
"This  
is why they put together a set of proposals articulated 
in four pillars: Leadership, EcoSystem, People and 
Data."
"Leadership is expected to drive the sustainability 
strategy toward action mode, transition and innova-
tion."
"As part of an EcoSystem, the Group shall rally 
its network and expand partnership culture in its  
interactions with customers, suppliers and other stake-
holders."
"“It’s  
important to make what is happening right now tan-
gible for people,” says Claire Du Peloux."
"“Above all, 
we have to give ourselves the tools to do something 
about it.” Finally, an example to illustrate the data  
enhancement vision could be the data management 
workstream, which would allow harmonization  
and ensure a satisfactory level of data quality."
"“We at 
Symrise have to properly collect, structure and  
analyze our data in order to be successful,” Claire Du 
Peloux says."
"Du Peloux and Vassel are confident that the Houston 
program will provide a lot of impetus – even though 
the processes, standards and regulations can differ 
greatly between Pet Food and Cosmetic Ingredients, 
for example, or Fine Fragrance and Food & Beverage."
"“The learning curve is still steep,” Claire Du Peloux and 
Laure Vessel say."

ever, we have taken the first step – compiling the dif-
ferent needs and creating an approach that’s suitable 
for the entire Group.”

 We have known since time immemorial that 
eating and drinking nourish both body and soul."
"Initially it was merely a matter of satisfying hunger; 
enjoyment and health were secondary."
"Food has become an important part of our life, espe-
cially once basic needs have been met."
"Compared 
with centuries ago, people are far more concerned 
these days with what they are eating, how it affects 
their health and whether their eating habits are socially 
acceptable."
"The industry must constantly up its game 
and adapt to new trends."
"For Symrise, this means continuously monitoring and 
analyzing consumer behavior in the Taste, Nutrition &  
Health segment, to provide our customers with  
the best solution for their products in order to satisfy 
consumers."
"This applies to small food startups and  
global food companies alike."
"Our trendscope™ report, 
conceived in 2007 originally for the beverages market, 
is intended to serve precisely this purpose."
"The trendscope™ team now draws on a large number 
of qualitative and quantitative approaches combined 
with a variety of different data sources."
"“For exam-
ple, we analyze consumer reports about food that we 
find online or on social media,” says Leif Jago of a 
significant part of their research."
"He is Global Market-
ing Manager Food & Beverage at Symrise and since 
2021 has been one of the people responsible for the 
report."
"The team also analyzes studies, market reports 
and other surveys in order to better understand  
consumer behavior and preferences."
"The research also 
looks at the new products being launched by the 
food and beverages industry."
"“Many trends emerge 
in the world’s urban hotspots."
"In twelve of those,  
including Shanghai, Berlin, Tokyo and New York, we 
have conducted interviews with food bloggers,  
journalists and trendspotters,” says Jago."
"The findings 
are shared and discussed with Symrise colleagues 
from marketing and product development at sites all 
over the world, who contribute their expert knowl-
edge of local trends."
"“We also take this opportunity 
to find out which concepts are in particularly high 
demand among our customers at the moment, to be 
sure their side is also reflected,” explains Regine  
Lueghausen."
"This holistic approach goes even further: 
The research provides the basis for individual reports 
for the beverages, food, dairy products, snacks and 
confectionery product categories."
"Even the Pet Food 
division benefits from the report because product 
ranges for pets are often influenced by food trends."
"» 
Consumers are increasingly asking 
for plant-based products that are

The result is a comprehensive overview of the macro 
trends of the coming years."
"To take an example from 
trendscope™ 2024+: “The topic of health is becoming 
increasingly important, particularly since the begin-
ning of the coronavirus pandemic, and physical and 
mental well-being are a priority for many people,” 
says Leif Jago."
"According to him, consumers are gaining 
a better understanding of how closely the two are 
linked."
"trendscope™ features another similar trend, 
which it calls “mindful choices,” referring to the  
push to consume less sugar, salt and fat but without 
sacrificing taste; the term “plant-based” is generally 
used as a synonym for meat substitutes."
"“But we  
are noticing that the phenomenon is much broader: 
Consumers are increasingly asking for plant-based 
products that are tasty and healthy, and not only as 
an alternative to eating meat,” says Leif Jago."
"For  
instance: “Activist Eating” sees consumers seeking out 
products that can be manufactured with significantly 
lower carbon emissions than others."
"“This trend will 
be around for a while.” For Symrise, there is always the 
question of what the macro trends mean for our  
own portfolio, says Regine Lueghausen."
"“We are ex-
tremely agile and are always keeping an eye on the

skill sets we need."
"The objective is to help our  
customers achieve their goals and simultaneously 
contribute to the sustainable success of Symrise.” 
Once trendscope™ is developed for a particular prod-
uct category, it sets off a structured process."
"The 
Symrise business units that implement the findings 
receive in-depth webinar training, supplemented  
by a toolbox of materials, ranging from brief descrip-
tions of the trends, infographics, right through to 
presentations and videos tailored to individual cus-
tomers."
"“We can then build on this knowledge to  
develop taste solutions that we can use to reconcile 
consumer demands with our customers’ strategies,” 
says Barbara Bridges."
"“We can use trendscope™ to 
create value by making better use of our resources.” 
The Food & Beverage Global Account Director passes 
on the report’s findings to her international custom-
ers."
"“Together we can approach projects in a much 
more targeted way, are quicker, more agile and thus

customers have been asking more frequently about 
what benefits these products have for the consumer."

THE FUTURE OF TREND RESEARCH  
With Symvision AI™, Symrise has developed its  
own tool that can predict taste trends using artificial 
intelligence."
"It uses data collected by Symrise 
through its trend research over 10 years to better  
understand markets, consumer preferences and 
trends."

from market launches and insights from market  
experts."
"Bringing all this together makes it possible 
to predict taste trends and how they will develop

for proposed new food concepts to succeed.
"“This 
development is also due of course to consumers 
nowadays being very well informed and wanting the 
best products for their particular situation,” says  
Barbara Bridges."
Her colleague Katja Tiitinen confirms this.
"As Regional 
Director Sensory & Consumer Insights for the Food & 
Beverage EAME region, Katja works at the interfaces of 
the internal value chain."
"“Our strength is that we can 
incorporate trends at any point, and we also receive 
corresponding feedback, from areas spanning research, 
production, and marketing,” she says."
"Her team tests 
products for their technical and taste properties, among 
other things, and she recognized some time ago that 
sourcing locally is becoming increasingly important."
"“Many developments are taking place worldwide, more 
than ever since the advent of social media,” she adds."
"“But we are also seeing that some trends vary in differ-
ent parts of the world.” The opportunities this offers 
for Symrise and its customers are huge."
"Complexity too 
is increasing, meaning that Katja Tiitinen also has  
the task of bridging the gap between the different areas."
"“We translate the trends for different customers into 
different products and adapt tastes to the respective 
market, for example.”

For Symrise and its customers, therefore, the research 
is worthwhile on several levels."
"Product develop-
ment becomes more precise, faster and more sustain-

also benefit: They can enjoy foods that cater pre-
cisely to their tastes as well as nutrition and health 
requirements."

Symrise consolidates its expertise in Health Active solutions, 
which are used in health-related products."
"In a field that harbors 
enormous opportunities for growth, the Taste, Nutrition & 
Health segment has built a dedicated team to develop a vision 
and a strategy, drawing on many years of experience and meeting 
consumers’ demand to proactively improve their health."
" “In my 17 years with the company, health 
has always been a focus for me,” says Nathalie  
Richer, leading Human Health in the Taste, Nutrition & 
Health segment."
"“For a long time, our products  
have been contributing to people’s well-being on many 
levels.” Today people and pet parents are in search  
of products benefiting the body and health."
"Therefore, 
industrials are asking for solutions to meet these  
expectations."
"In 2023, Symrise decided to accelerate its position 
and reinforce its expertise on health."
"“We have  
now structured a new leadership team who has re-
viewed our approach, co-built a clear vision and 
new strategy dedicated to Health Active Solutions,” 
explains Dr. Olivier Ballèvre, Health Strategy Vice 
President for Taste, Nutrition & Health."
"The team, which 
began its work in 2023, aims to focus on Health  
Active Solutionsʼ benefits, sourced from nature and 
substantiated by scientific findings."
"Echoing its  
historical commitment to sustainability, Symrise’s  
raw materials responsibly sourced from nature in-
clude processed side streams of fruit, vegetables and 
meat."
"The resulting products will be addressing  
three strategic health benefit areas: gut and immune 
health, metabolic health, and healthy aging."
"This  
will enable Symrise to stand apart from its competitors."
"The product portfolio is broad: “We are looking closely 
at a diverse application market for people and  
pets, as both markets share similar health challenges."
"There are a lot of common aspects on innovating  
for Pet Health and Human Health,” says Dr. Olivier 
Ballèvre."
"There are Symrise products for use in  
functional foods and beverages, in dietary supple-
ments and in medical nutrition delivering targeted 
health benefits."
"For pets, there are functional  
treats, pet dietary supplements, and also veterinary 
diet."
"To achieve its goals in these areas, Symrise  
is heavily investing in people, research and develop-
ment, communication and manufacturing capa­
bilities."

The company’s portfolio already included natural 
bioactives."
"“We now aim to expand our offering with 
solutions that are backed by stronger science and 
contribute to improving users’ health – not treating 
diseases,” says Nathalie Richer."
"“To achieve this, we  
are regrouping internal know-how and recruiting very 
specific health experts in different domains to deve-
lop a complementary skillful team that will build on  
existing know-how."
"One of the challenges here is the 
different regulations that apply in the various regions."
"“In Europe, for example, regulatory aspects can be 
very different to other regions, like North America 
and APAC,” explains Nathalie Richer."
"Therefore, the regional Business Development  
Managers will have a key role to play in implementing 
the strategy and developing the product portfolio."
"“Here, we will be aligning closely with the needs  
of the respective markets,” says Renata Leite, Global 
Health Strategic Marketing Director."
Our product pipeline is well stocked.
"A good example 
of a specific product is the Prebiocran™ premium 
branded solution."
"It is rich in 
­
polyphenols – a group of secondary plant compounds 
that support a healthy gut."
"Prebiocran™ proved to be able to specifically modulate 
gut flora composition and function and boost in­
testinal barrier function."
"“There are promising findings 
showing that Prebiocran™ can help support meta­
bolic health,” says Renata Leite."
"An in vitro study using 
a simulation of the gastrointestinal tract supports 
the product’s effectiveness."
"A clinical pilot study was 
also conducted."
"For a complete and additional  
value solution, products like Prebiocran™ can also be 
combined with other Symrise expertise, such as 
taste-masking."

 Anne Dussourt stands in the laboratory in 
the Symrise main building in the Clichy district of 
Paris."
"Using a pipette, she drops exactly 3.5 grams of 
a fragrance ingredient into a glass beaker that al-
ready contains a few centiliters of a clear liquid."
"She 
carefully shakes the beaker, dips a paper scent strip 
into it, pulls it out and carefully approaches it with 
her nose."
"She smells it and nods – she likes the com-
position."
"Working in the laboratory is part of the daily routine for 
this 29-year-old, who studied chemistry in Strasbourg 
and then at the renowned ISIPCA perfumery school  
in Paris before graduating as a perfumer at Symrise in 
September 2023."
"She now develops perfume com­
positions on the computer, has them mixed together 
and tests them."
"From time to time, however, she  
carries out the manual process herself to get a first-
hand impression."
"But Anne Dussourt has a much  
bigger goal in mind beyond her daily work: She wants 
to help minimize the carbon footprint of perfumes."
"That’s a major task, since Symrise has a palette of over 
a thousand raw materials which are currently actively 
used for new compositions."
"Training at the Symrise Perfumery School takes five 
years."
"For her masterpiece, Anne Dussourt examined 
the impact of carbon footprint on fragrance creations."
"Although only a few grams of fragrance oil are used 
in a typical bottle of perfume, the quantity makes  
all the difference."
"Worldwide, millions upon millions of 
perfumes are sold every year in the fine fragrance 
segment alone."
"Fragrances are also used in detergents, 
shampoos, soaps and lotions."
"Anne Dussourt men-
tions another figure: “The average French person pro-
duces eight to twelve tons of CO2 per year."
"Although 
the fragrances only make up a tiny fraction of that, we 
can still contribute to reducing the amount of green-
house gases released into the atmosphere.”

Philippa Smith, Sustainability Director Scent & Care  
at Symrise."
"“That’s why we focused on examining  
our range of raw materials at an early stage and are 
proud of this project."
"It’s  groundbreaking in our  
industry.” The degree of innovation in the masterpiece 
is very high."
"“Before my thesis, there was no clear 
definition of what a low carbon footprint should mean 
for a ­
fragrance,” says Anne Dussourt."
"“Linking  
fragrance creation to carbon footprint data in our 
system was a key part of the project.”
In her master’s thesis, Anne Dussourt focused on  
the application of sustainability data to fragrances."
"She created a range of fragrance compositions that 
Symrise customers use, for example in shampoos, 
shower gels and deodorants."
"To do so, she first created 
a conventional fragrance, such as a fruit-scented 
Sustainability is extremely important to Anne  
Dussourt."
"She already dealt with biodegradable and 
renewable raw materials for her exam as a junior  
perfumer."
"“Sustainability is part of the creation pro-
cess,” she says."
"“We have to constantly rethink  
and implement it.” In her masterpiece, she took her 
ideas further, evaluated them and created a range  
of fragrances, focusing on different sustainability  
parameters."
"A panel of experienced managers, per-
fumers and HR managers judged the creations."
She was assisted by Seynabou Ndao.
"The 24-year-old, 
who focused on sustainability and green chemistry 
during her chemistry studies, started as an intern at 
Symrise."
"She analyzed how much CO2 is emitted 
during the entire value chain up to the completion of 
the perfume – from the cultivation of the individual 
raw materials to mixing in the laboratories."
"She spent 
several months analyzing the portfolio of raw mate­
rials and collecting information."
"“With some materials, 
such as alcohols or esters, it’s relatively easy be-
cause the processes are so clearly structured and well 
doc­
umented,” says the chemical engineer, who 
comes from Senegal and studied in France."
"The sub-
stances that Symrise produces from sidestreams  
at its plant in Jacksonville in the United States are rela-
tively easy to cluster and evaluate, says Seynabou  
Ndao."
"“With essential oils that come from natural raw 
materials such as plants, however, it’s much more 
complex.” She is continuously working to improve data 
quality."
"To that end, she also involves the suppliers: 
“We work with them to support them and encourage 
them on their carbon footprint journey.” 
The topic has gained huge momentum overall for 
Symrise since 2022."
"“The carbon footprint of raw  
Testing alternatives is  
one way to optimize  
fragrance compositions."
"Seynabou Ndao analyzed the raw material 
 
portfolio of Symrise to determine how 
 
much CO2 is emitted by the value chain."
"In the other blends, she replaced various 
ingredients in order to reduce the carbon emissions 
and use as many biodegradable and renewable raw 
materials as possible."
"“We were able to show that we 
could reduce the carbon footprint by up to 20 %, for 
example,” says Anne Dussourt."
"They discovered  
that it’s easier to replace certain fragrance ingredients, 
but more difficult to do so for others."
"One positive 
result was that through careful ingredient selection, 
costs and performance could be maintained."
"However, determining the carbon footprint alone  
is not enough."
"The industry cannot simply dispense 
with fragrances that have high carbon emissions."
"“We face a challenge on several levels: Fragrances have 
to continue to smell as good as they did before,  
Anne Dussourt (left) and Seynabou Ndao test  
fragrance mixtures to determine how they  
behave when used – in products like hand creams."

work in applications, comply with regulations and be 
comparable in terms of price,” says Anne Dussourt."
"In addition, Symrise’s customers often have different 
demands when it comes to the biodegradability  
of products or the renewability of raw materials, for 
example."
"What’s more, they want to set themselves 
apart from each other."
"Consumers also only buy what they like on all levels: 
They want sustainability, but also the familiar fra-
grance."
"That includes ensuring that a fragrance, for 
example in a detergent, doesn’t evaporate imme­
diately."
"It still has to be perceptible when an item of 
clothing is taken out of the closet after being there  
for a while."
"Because some molecules only interact with 
others in a specific way, perfumers cannot simply 
swap raw materials."
"At the same time, certain sub-
stances are essential for a perfume: “We need musky 
base notes, for example, which often have a higher 
carbon footprint."
"They do, however, ensure longevity,” 
says Anne Dussourt."
"This is exactly where great  
savings can be made if there are good substitutes or 
other compositions."
"“The substances are almost always  
produced according to the principles of green  
chemistry from sidestreams in other sectors and are 
therefore very sustainable,” says Anne Dussourt."
"Philippa Smith is also aware of several levers that 
Symrise can use."
"“We will talk to suppliers about  
how they can use these materials to reduce the car-
bon footprint,” says the Sustainability Director."
"Symrise has a close relationship with producers, thus 
allowing the company to select the most sustain- 
able suppliers."
"“We also decide for ourselves what  
we include in the portfolio and can therefore also pay  
attention to the CO2 values."
"And we have a lot of  
influence on the creation process, in which we can  
put together the best possible compositions.” To  
that end, the team is rolling out the findings for all 
perfumers around the world to answer questions 
and also raise awareness of the topic."
"Philippa Smith and Anne Dussourt also put the work 
on the carbon footprint in perspective: “Sustain­
ability is much more than just preventing greenhouse 
gases,” says Philippa Smith."
"“The topic is highly  
complex when we include the other dimensions of sus-
tainability,” Anne Dussourt adds."
"In Madagascar,  
for example, where Symrise distills a range of natural 
substances, the focus is on social impact with  
the smallholder farmers, while in India the focus is on 
supporting farming communities through climate- 
smart agriculture, such as solar-powered irrigation."
"At 
the same time, natural substances have the disad-
vantage that they use large areas of land, but the ad-
vantage that they can support biodiversity."
"“We  
have to therefore always look at how we can improve 
products in all areas,” says Philippa Smith."
"To that 
end, the data will be optimized in the coming years as 
a basis, hence making more and more fragrance 
compositions more sustainable."
"“We’ll continue to 
work on the topic so that we can use increasingly  
better and more sustainable raw materials to develop 
sustainable creations,” says Anne Dussourt."
"“Our 
journey has only just begun.”

Symrise for new fragrance

In the past year, Symrise began restructuring its human resources 
function."
"In this interview, Dr. Stephanie Coßmann, the member of  
the Symrise Executive Board responsible for HR and Legal, describes 
how three functions are being combined into one to create a uniform 
global HR team for the entire Symrise Group."
"At the same time,  
Human Resources is working to introduce a software solution that 
will make things easier in the future for managers, employees  
and HR specialists and support the implementation of other future 
projects."
"In addition, three executives from the HR organization  
report on details of the HR strategy."

Dr. Coßmann, you joined the Executive Board 
in February 2023 to take responsibility for the 
new HR and Legal function."
"This is certain to change the tasks of our HR 
colleagues."
It sounds as if a lot of effort is involved.
" Symrise has a fantastic culture that im-
pressed me from the start."
"It is the people and how 
they work together that make the difference."
"The 
company’s employees have a very entrepreneurial 
mindset, with a pragmatic and hands-on approach 
to solving problems."
"They are sometimes hindered by 
what I see as the biggest challenge in our function."
"The strong growth and many acquisitions in recent 
years have changed the company but the structures  
and processes haven’t quite kept pace."
"We lack a suit-
able framework for both HR and compliance."
" The old ways of working are not adequate in 
the battle for new employees."
"Our recruiters now  
operate in global networks, using LinkedIn and other 
social media to identify future candidates."
"They are 
able to engage with them and hopefully attract them 
to join us."
"Another example: We are working on uni-
form remuneration structures and job titles to also facil-
itate the transfer of employees between regions."
"To 
date, there have been no standard assessment criteria 
in talent management and few talent programs."
"In  
order to implement all these plans, we are introducing 
Workday, a human capital management tool."
"The first 
module should be up and running by the end of the 
year."
"There’s still a lot of work to be done before then 
in order to collate, analyze and process all the existing 
data within the company."
"The system will represent  
a quantum leap for us, enabling us to work faster, more 
transparently and with greater focus."
"It will also put  
us in a better position to achieve the fourth goal of our 
work."
"As part of our sustainability activities, we must 
intensify our reporting of HR indicators such as diversity 
and occupational safety and manage these accordingly."
" We are living in an era in which companies 
have to compete for talents and not vice versa as used 
to be the case."
"People still want to be paid well for 
their work, but aspects such as a company’s purpose, 
culture, products and teams are becoming increas-
ingly important."
"We at Symrise have a lot to offer – and 
we aim to highlight this."
" In order to refocus on the company’s em-
ployees, as we should do in our work, we need to  
create structures like a transparent salary structure 
that enables us to see what talents we have and  
track the performance of both our employees and 
business units."
"If we don’t do this, we’ll be stuck  
in silos."
"Our starting point is the tHRive project, which 
is aimed at making our HR organization fit for  
the future."
"A core element of this is harmonizing the 
framework and procedures for all the company’s  
HR teams."
" We have established four Centers of Expertise 
covering “Talent Acquisition,” “Compensation and  
Benefits,” “Talent Management” and “Systems, Analytics 
and Sustainability.” These are all future issues that  
impact the entire company."

 As the Program Manager for tHRive, I am responsible for implementing the new structure 
for our HR function worldwide."
"In the past, we were very fragmented, with different roles, pro-
cesses and standards in the various regions and segments."
"Now we are working on a new system 
that functions in all countries and organizations, no matter how big they are."
"The goal is “One HR,” 
a global HR community."
"In this connection, we have redefined some roles."
"These employees will 
move from being generalists to specialists who perform a variety of tasks."
"They will provide global 
process support to their colleagues in the regions, who in turn will ensure that the processes are 
applied regionally."
HR work is often governed by different rules depending on the country.
"Cultural 
circumstances vary, employment contracts may be structured differently and laws and regulations 
aren’t the same everywhere."
All this needs to be taken into account.
"We are currently in the transition phase toward a joint system with harmonized global standards 
that will be mapped in our Workday HR suite."
"It is important that the entire team is on board with 
this."
"We are training some 200 employees who are all very experienced in their own fields and  
familiar with the specific features of their regions."
"It is remarkable to see the commitment demon-
strated by our colleagues in all time zones and the expertise they are contributing to shape this 
change."
"We will be supporting them in familiarizing themselves with the new structure and work-
ing in a digitalized process landscape."
"One thing is clear: Such far-reaching changes require equally 
intensive support."
"And we also should not forget that it’s a work in progress – and that’s a great 
challenge."
"However, I’m very confident that we will achieve excellent results working with our col-
leagues and their teams."

 In Workday, we have chosen a platform that will enable 
us to implement all our HR processes."
"On the one hand, this  
applies to our HR colleagues, who will be able to map the recruit-
ment, talent management, HR planning and all other core pro-
cesses in many different languages."
"It also applies to the compa-
ny’s employees."
"They will receive access to Workday, which is 
being implemented as a cloud solution, enabling them to consult 
their own data and documents and to obtain information about 
development opportunities."
"We want satisfied employees and 
Workday will help achieve this."
"It will also be a powerful tool for 
the company’s executives."
"They will be able to analyze which 
talents they have in their organization, identify suitable develop-
ment opportunities and plan further steps together with their 
employees."
"In a later expansion phase, this transparency will also 
increase mobility within the company."
"By involving employees more closely in this way, we hope to keep 
them with the company longer."
"It is known that transparency 
and an open corporate culture can contribute to this."
"We are aim-
ing to reach the entire workforce of some 13,000 employees,  
including those in production roles."
"That is why it was important 
to us that employees can also use Workday on their private  
cellphones – of course, in compliance with clear security rules."
"At the moment, we are preparing the data and consulting on  
the processes worldwide."
"We are leaving behind a fragmented 
system landscape in which various systems previously ran in  
parallel."
"We now have to collect, validate and cleanse data so 
that we can make a fresh start with Workday."
"This will help 
Symrise to evolve successfully in the long term."

 In many companies, HR has the task of covering the 
backs of the people who work in business operations."
"The focus 
is on recruitment, employer branding, onboarding processes, 
contract design and training and development."
"These are all im-
portant tasks without which a company cannot function."
"At 
Symrise, we are now going one step further by becoming a stra-
tegic business partner which strengthens the link between  
HR and business strategies."
"One example of this is strategic HR planning, which we intend to 
address with a stronger focus."
"We will be creating structures 
that enable us to document our employees’ strengths worldwide."
"This will enable us to see where we need certain skills within  
the company and plan better for the next five years."
"It will also 
make it possible to improve the management of our business  
activities and facilitate the transfer of talents."
"As a result, we won’t 
be a pure service function but will be involved in conception  
and design, working both with the individual segments and across 
the entire company."
"To this end, we have created new structures  
in which four HR Business Partners have regional responsibility 
while three others work globally across the different stages of  
the value chain."
"This close connection to the business is also evi-
dent in my case."
"I was formerly Director Category & Product 
Management in the APAC region; now I’m the Global HR Business 
Partner and a member of the Leadership team in the Taste,  
Nutrition & Health segment."
"We will use our experience to act as 
the interface, strengthening and developing the link between 
the business and HR."
"The team uses various different approaches in its work and 
combines them with know-how from other areas in collaborative 
efforts to develop the farming of the future, which will be of 
great benefit to the company."

 Esther-Corinna Schwarze deftly moves the 
lever to the right, opens the door of the environmental 
chamber and takes a step to the side."
"The small, brightly lit room houses containers 
from which supported green plants rise two meters 
high."
"“This is all vanilla, but different species or geno-
types,” says Symrise’s master technologist for Agro-
Science, looking at the plants with their dark green 
leaves."
"She then closes the door to stop the tem-
perature from dropping."
"In the adjacent environmental 
chamber is paracress."
"The view is similar, but on a 
smaller scale: knee-high plants with distinctive yellow, 
egg-shaped flowers, under LED lighting."
"The two environmental chambers, a large greenhouse 
and another container are situated at the edge of  
the Symrise site in Holzminden, directly adjacent to 
Esther-Corinna Schwarze’s office."
"She heads up a  
relatively new research and development department 
within the Food & Beverage division: AgroScience, 
set up in 2017."
"Among other things, Esther and her 
three colleagues look into new plants and farming 
practices and putting the knowledge into practice."
Her work shows up in multiple different areas.
"Symrise 
has integrated its value chain backward in many 
places, for example with the vanilla in Madagascar 
or the onion in the area around Holzminden."
"“We  
work closely with the farmers who grow very specific 
 
varieties for us in clearly defined qualities at a cer-
tain price,” says Esther-Corinna Schwarze."
"For this to 
work, Symrise must understand the plants and their 
cultivation."
"This applies not only to existing collabora-
tions; in the future too we want to cultivate new 
plants in which we have a particular interest."
"So it’s 
very helpful to have some understanding of the 
plants and their requirements,” says Esther-Corinna 
Schwarze."
"“Then we can pass on our knowledge to 
the farmers and obtain better results.” 
One example of this is paracress, which grows mostly 
in Brazil where it goes by the name of jambú."
"“It is 
used to flavor food, but mostly for medicinal purposes, 
such as treating toothache,” says Esther-Corinna 
Schwarze."
"Paracress has a mild anesthetic effect and 
makes the mouth tingle."
"“It could be used, for exam-
ple, in oral hygiene or to mask unwanted effects in 
certain foods.” Another objective could also be to 
cultivate paracress indoors as opposed to in fields in 
the tropics where it is currently grown."
"“This is also 
conceivable in the countries of origin."
"Then we could 
achieve a much better quality, cultivate the plants  
all year round and maybe even harvest multiple times 
a year,” says Esther-Corinna Schwarze."
"To this end, 
she tests different potting soils and substrates, fertil-
izers and light settings, for example."
"She analyzes 
root growth, to accelerate it, and also different harvest-
ing and processing methods."
"“We test which ingre­
dients we get from fresh or dried components and 
how they correlate to flowers, leaves and stems."
"»
We work  
closely with  
the farmers."

Indoor farming is of particular importance for Symrise."
"“It was given a boost in the 2010s as advances in  
LED technology made the requisite lighting affordable,” 
says Dr. Jakob Ley."
"“We have long been working  
on this and are currently concentrating on around 
10 different varieties of plant that previously were 
hardly ever cultivated or only grow in the tropics,” 
explains the Director Research Biobased Ingredients."
"In addition to AgroScience, he is also responsible  
for four other research areas."
"“This means that we can 
farm and analyze more unusual varieties here in 
Holzminden.” 
One challenge was to obtain the plant material in the 
first place."
"“The Nagoya Protocol seeks to safeguard 
biodiversity, particularly in emerging and developing 
countries, and prevents the exploitation of natural 
resources,” explains Ley."
"Ley is keen to point out that the countries of origin 
too will benefit from the work at a later date."
"For ex-
ample, the team is working on improving their un-
derstanding of when the vanilla buds blossom."
"“The 
small farmers in Madagascar must check all the 
plants every morning during the growing season."
"The 
orchids only bloom for one day and the farmer  
must pollinate them by hand,” says Ley of the time- 
consuming work."
"“If we understand how this pro- 
cess works in the plant, how we can predict it and 
maybe even shorten it, that would be a great help.” 
Symrise is also experimenting with light and mois- 
ture control."
"The researchers analyze leaves, roots 
and stems to try to gain a better understanding  
of the phytohormones that, as signaling molecules, 
regulate the development of the plants."
"The team is 
also investig­
ating infections in the vanilla plant 
caused by fusarium."
"The sac fungi are responsible 
for the loss of 30 % of plants in the plantation."
"“We 
experiment with different irrigation methods or  
substrates that could prevent the fungus from grow-
ing,” says Ley."
"The findings will then also be passed 
on to the farmers in Madagascar."
"For Jakob Ley, AgroScience is here to stay, and his 
platform works closely with other research depart-
ments."
"There are collaboration projects in place  
with universities and other industrial partners, with 
know-how and analytical equipment being shared."
"For Dr. Gerhard Krammer too, AgroScience is inextri-
cably linked to Symrise."
"“We have a long tradition  
of processing natural substances."
"We synthesized the

first vanilla from conifer 150 years ago."
"Today, we 
buy natural substances from all over the world,” 
says the head of the Research & Technology  
division in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment."
"And he believes it makes perfect sense to also 
conduct research in farming."
"“If we combine the 
growing methods of biotechnology with modern 
farming practices, we can produce better har-
vests and better quality."
"We also prevent waste 
and develop innovative products, thereby be-
coming increasingly sustainable.” Krammer sees 
indoor farming as key in this regard."
"But the goal is always the same: “Symrise cur-
rently uses around 1,500 to 2,000 botanical  
raw materials that must primarily be extracted 
and processed."
"So it is important to develop  
products with particular properties that have an 
unmis­
takable smell, taste and effect,” says  
Gerhard Krammer."
"One example for this is the 
onion."
"Symrise has worked with farmers in  
the region to optimize methods to such an extent 
that the extract is exported as far afield as Japan."
"“We have cultivated a very reasonably priced  
raw material in such a way and in such formulations 
that it is unmistakable.” Gerhard Krammer sees 
further work on raw materials in AgroScience as 
essential."
"“It gives us such a unique selling prop­
osition that we can achieve sustained success.” 
SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT IN  
SINGAPORE 
When space is at a premium, build upward."
"This 
works just as well with plants as it does with 
buildings."
"Lettuce, herbs and strawberries can be 
grown in multiple levels one on top of the other 
under artificial light and without soil, receiving 
nutrients in liquid form."
"This does indeed save 
space: One hectare of vertical farming is the equiv-
alent of 10 hectares of conventional fields."
"On 
the one hand, this farming method could in future 
help to feed people regionally and sustainably  
in towns."
"On the other, the plants can be farmed 
in a controlled environment in such a way that 
they produce more valuable ingredients."
"To this end, the Symrise Scent & Care segment has 
embarked on an experiment together with  
Taste, Nutrition & Health in Singapore."
"A multidis-
ciplinary team selected plants that are already 
part of Symrise’s raw materials portfolio or will be 
of interest in the future and brought together 
plant geneticists, agronomists, flavor and fragrance 
scientists as well as data analysts."
"Local company 
VertiVegies provided the vertical farming know-
how."
"The experiments varied the light spectrum 
and intensity, for example, as well as the nutri-
tion of the plants in order to observe the effect on 
their olfactory and organoleptic properties."
"“The partnership with VertiVegies has given us 
fascinating new insights into how we can devel-
op flavor and fragrance raw materials in the  
future,” says Dr. Norbert Braun, Vice President 
Innovation & QC at Symrise Asia Pacific."
"The aim is to greatly accelerate the  
pace at which products and solutions  
are developed and commercialized  
in the future."
"To achieve this, a team of 
experts from all areas of the organization 
was put together to redesign a future- 
fit innovation model that complements  
existing successful mechanisms."

 “We have always been an innovative com-
pany,” says Nick Russell, “and now we are going  
further."
"There are many reasons for introducing this new way 
of thinking and acting."
"“At the moment, the world is 
changing very rapidly – with a corresponding impact 
on consumers’ needs and wishes,” says Nick Russell."
"“Our customers expect us to deliver unique solutions 
that make a difference."
"Lastly, the company aims to break down 
information silos, connect unrelated innovation pipe-
lines and make better use of its own resources."
"To respond to customers’ wishes and, at the same time, 
be a first mover in other areas, Taste, Nutrition &  
Health must go down new paths."
"“It is important that 
IGNITE does not overturn those things that were  
already good but that we develop a complementary 
approach."
"We will continue to invest in proprietary 
design and new molecules,” says Nick Russell."
"That  
is why the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment launched  
IGNITE as a very open-ended initiative."
"The entire  
organization was involved and around 250 experts 
from all regions and functions were canvassed."
The findings were then evaluated and analyzed.
"In the 
next step, a core team of around 60 employees de-
vised a viable process."
"“We established four working 
groups to look at strategy, processes, implementation 
and finance,” explains Betty Fan, the IGNITE pro-
gram lead."
"Throughout 2023, the team collaborated 
closely to deliver the design of our renewed approach."
"HIGHER,

The next phase of the program will be starting in 
2024."
"Aptly named SPRINT, moving from the former 
IGNITE design phase, to the implementing and  
learning phase."
"It will collect and implement the first 
ideas."
"“It’s about being fast and agile and about 
shortening development times, which until now could 
take up to anywhere between 18 to 24 months,”  
says Betty Fan."
"Traditionally, we have used our own 
technologies to innovate on behalf of our major cus-
tomers and we were highly successful."
"Now, a growing 
number of companies – including smaller ones –  
are coming to us with projects to implement with much 
shorter launch time expectations,” explains the pro-
gram lead."
"One example of this are new beverage con-
cepts such as the sustainable energy drinks from 
German start-up Holy, which are taking the market 
by storm thanks to their entirely natural fruit flavors 
and colorants, very low sugar content and the  
absence of taurine and extenders."
"Although 
these products were not created with the aid of 
IGNITE, this kind of collaboration is a great  
example of what we will be looking for more in 
the future."
"“The team met us via an innovation 
hub for food and beverage start-ups with 
which we cooper­
ated closely,” says Betty Fan."
"“Working with the start-up’s founders, our  
colleagues developed and commercialized con-
cepts in a very short time.” 
According to Nick Russell, speed is a crucial factor  
in success."
"“We have learned that we sometimes stay 
wedded to ideas for too long and try to translate 
them into products, even if markets, customers and 
trends have long since moved on."
"IGNITE is intended 
to change that."
"With IGNITE, we want to encourage 
people not to fall in love with their first ideas and to 
start getting more comfortable with ‘failure’ – as  
a very important step of the process,” says Russell."
"The aim is to continuously question the innovation 
process in a structured way to reduce the use of  
resources and achieve greater success rates."
"“Our 
priority is to focus on the right ideas,” says Russell."
"“It’s okay to make mistakes but we need to be faster 
at recog­
nizing them.” 
In the same way as the creation of IGNITE, implemen-
tation will involve employees from all regions and 
functions."
"“We aim to move from an organization 
structure-driven approach to a much more project-  
driven approach, and equip the project team with 
the best experts no matter where they sit."
"This  
will enable us to accelerate processes and view  
innovation from the perspective of the entire value 
chain,” says Betty Fan."
"This should yield service  
and process innovations as well as product innova-
tions."
"One especially important aspect of IGNITE is change 
and communication, a primary task for Kaylee  
Pretorius, change management practitioner for the 
program."
"One important point to emphasize is  
that this is not only a process change, but a cultural 
and mindset change."
"“Our team is committed to  
engaging and supporting all employees in this trans-
formation”, says Kaylee Pretorius, who will be leading 
the communication materials and rollout cam-
paign."
"“We are continuously learning where 
our employees stand and where the changes 
need to be communicated.” 
With support from the core team, events and 
training sessions are in motion to develop  
the future platform for innovation that will also 
be opened externally to customers and suppli-
ers."
"“We will provide clearly defined channels 
that can be used to share and evaluate ideas 
before they are implemented,” says Kelvin Bartley, 
Global Project Management Officer for the pro-
gram."
"Artificial intelligence and automation will be 
used to analyze the large data volumes and make 
them usable."
"IGNITE is to be introduced across the Taste, Nutrition & 
 
Health segment in the coming months."
"The team is 
collaborating with all the business units to achieve this 
and is also working on synergies with the Scent & 
Care segment."
"Taste, Nutrition & Health has an ambi-
tious goal, as Nick Russell explains: “Our sales cur-
rently stand at around three billion."

Symrise has broken down its sustainability activities 
into four areas: footprint, sourcing, innovation  
and care."
"With them, the company reaches the sus­
tainability goals of the United Nations and hits  
its own sustainability targets around the world."
"Examples from a broad array of areas show how and 
where Symrise acted in 2023 – from projects in  
India and certifications in Madagascar to preparations 
for complying with the Corporate Sustainability  
Reporting Directive of the European Union."

Facets of  
sustainability 
Symrise India supported 
the clean-up of a pond 
 
in the Indian community 
 
of Sithalapakkam."
"In 
 
another project, lights 
were installed on a 
 
heavily used street."

Better water, more light
At the company’s location in India, Symrise joined forces with an NGO called the United 
Way of Chennai to provide support to the community."
"Both projects were part of SMETA 
4-Pillar audits."
"A nondescript pond is located in Sithalapakkam, a community that is just five 
kilometers from the location of Symrise India."
"The pond is called Nalla Thanni 
Kulam and once played a key role in the lives of the 400 families who live in the 
neighborhood: Residents spent their leisure time here and used the rainwater 
captured by the pond to drink and use at home."
"In recent years, though, mainte-
nance of the pond stopped."
"Symrise India, the local community and the United Way of Chennai have now taken 
the initiative and thoroughly cleaned Nalla Thanni Kulam with the goal of mak-
ing it usable once again."
"The United Way of Chennai is an NGO that is active in such 
areas as the environment, education and health."
"The pond was dredged and de-
sludged."
A nature path leading around the pond was created.
"A play area for children 
was built, and benches and solar-powered lights were installed."
"The project in India is just one of many that Symrise is conducting in the immediate 
neighborhood there."
"This project and several others were honored during the 
SMETA 4-Pillar audit that the company conducted."
"The abbreviation stands for  
Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit."
"Under this program, companies commit 
themselves to joining the SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) and providing 
information about ethically sustainable production in the supply chain."
"The  
SMETA 4-Pillar audit focuses on four areas: labor standards, health and safety,  
the environment and business ethics."
"Another project in India is being conducted on a heavily used road that runs 
through Sithalapakkam."
"People felt unsafe at night, and  
a large number of accidents occurred."
"Symrise supported the installation of 
100 streetlights, also with the help of the United Way of Chennai."
"The highlight of 
it all: The lights are solar powered and are exceptionally sustainable as a result."
"In India, the team at 
 
Symrise India extended a 
helping hand to several 
communities near 
 
the company’s plant."

Ready for the CSRD
In November 2022, the EU Parliament passed the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD), a regulation that will significantly change the sustainability  
reporting that companies do."
"The directive requires the environmental and social 
impact of business activities to be disclosed."
"Companies must also detail their 
sustainability strategies and objectives as well as the impact of sustainability issues 
on their business situation."
"The report must also meet the high European Sustain-
ability Reporting Standards (ESRS)."
"In preparation for the new directive, Symrise 
conducted a materiality analysis that meets the requirements of the CSRD/ESRS 
in 2023."
"The focal points covered by this analysis were largely the same ones  
addressed during the previous year."
"In mid-2023, an internal working group led by 
the Executive Board was set up for the purpose of carrying out the requirements 
of CSRD/ESRS."
"Madagascar: 52 ingredients UEBT-certified
Symrise works with about 7,000 farmers in Madagascar."
"The company turns their 
raw materials into things like essential and plant oils."
"Fifty-two of these ingredients 
have now been certified by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT)."
"The UEBT is an  
international nonprofit organization that promotes the responsible sourcing of 
natural raw materials."
"Companies that are members of the association take steps  
to assure good working conditions along the supply chain and protect biodiversity."

Wages
Symrise considers appropriate and fair remuneration to be a human right that  
applies to all employees worldwide."
"We are therefore currently evaluating various 
benchmarking methods for living wages, which we plan to use in selected pilot 
countries in 2024."
"Building on these pilot projects, we will develop a roadmap and 
action plan to ensure that we pay all our employees the living wage by 2030."
"Turning the old into new
AfB gGmbH has collected 3,574 IT and mobile devices at Symrise over the past five

devices."
"AfB deletes the data, tests the hardware, orders replacement parts as  
well as cleans and repairs the devices."
"It has reintroduced 78 percent of them to 
the market."

MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT
Symrise is a German stock corporation with a dual manage-
ment structure consisting of an Executive Board and a Super-
visory Board."
"The Executive Board is responsible for manag-
ing the company with the primary goal of increasing the com-
pany’s value in a sustainable manner."
"The Supervisory Board

management activities."
"This oversight function is not only 
retrospective but also relates to providing advice to the Execu-
tive Board going forward."
"Executive Board management ac-
tivities may not be transferred to the Supervisory Board, which

ment of the company and regularly discusses business develop-
ment, planning, strategy and risks with the Executive Board."

"BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCTS
Value chain of Symrise
Symrise manufactures about 35,000 products from around 
10,000 – mostly natural – raw materials such as vanilla, citrus 
products or flower and plant materials."
"The value chain of 
the two segments extends across research and development, 
purchasing, production, and the sale of products and solu-
tions."
"Natural ingredients, flavors, perfume oils and active in-
gredients are generally central functional components in 
Symrise customers’ end products and are often a key factor 
in consumers’ purchasing decisions."
"Along with the typical 
product characteristics such as fragrance and taste, value cre-
ation at Symrise lies in the development of products with ad-
ditional benefits."
"Examples of how food ingredients and per-
fume oils are combined with other innovative components 
 
include flavors that enable the sugar or salt content of foods to 
be reduced or a moisturizing cosmetic ingredient that lowers 
the preservative content in care products."
"The extensive research and development (R & D) undertaken at 
the company, which is supplemented by a wide-reaching 
 
external network of partnerships with research institutes and 
scientific facilities, forms the basis of product development."
"Given the strong differences in sensory preferences from region 
to region, comprehensive consumer research is also an im-
portant part of the R & D activities at Symrise."
"CORPORATE STRUCTURE
The customers of Symrise include large, multinational com-
panies as well as important regional and local manufacturers 
of food, beverages, pet food, perfumes, cosmetics, personal

production plants."

"MARKET AND COMPETITION
MARKET STRUCTURE
The Symrise Group is active in many different markets around 
the world."
"These include the traditional market for flavors 
and fragrances (F & F market), which grew from € 31.2 billion in 
2022 to € 32.0 billion in 2023, according to calculations made 
by the IAL Consultants market research institute (13th Edition, 
September 2022)."
"In addition, with the Cosmetic Ingredients 
and Aroma Molecules divisions, the company is active in the 
market for aroma chemicals and cosmetic ingredients, which 
grew from € 7.8 billion in 2022 to € 8.0 billion in 2023, according 
to IAL reports (3rd Edition, December 2022)."
"Together, these 
markets are also referred to as the AFF market, which would 
have a volume of € 40.0 billion."
"This market will grow by 
around 3 % to 4 % in the long term."
"However, in 2023, the re-
levant market grew by only 2.6 % because inflation-related 
price effects were offset by slight volume declines."
"Worldwide, more than 500 companies are active in the rele-
vant market for Symrise."
"Following the most recent acquisitions 
and mergers, the four largest players (Givaudan, the AFF- 
relevant units of IFF, DSM-Firmenich and Symrise) together 
hold a market share of 67 %."
"The F & F market is characterized worldwide by high entry bar-
riers."
"There is increasing customer demand for higher quality 
and more differentiated products with ever-shorter product life 
cycles."
"The majority of products and recipes are manufac-
tured specially for individual customers."
"Furthermore, local 
taste preferences often dictate that there are many different 
recipes for a single end product that vary depending on the 
country in which it is marketed."
"Moreover, customer rela-
tions are often characterized by intensive cooperation in prod-
uct development."
"In addition to varying local taste preferences and consumer 
behaviors, there are other factors that also influence the de-
mand for end products in which Symrise products are used."
"The population’s increasing income in emerging markets is 
having a positive impact on the development of demand for 
products containing fragrances and flavorings or cosmetic in-
gredients."
"Market growth also depends on more basic prod-
ucts that meet everyday needs and already have an established 
presence in the markets of industrialized nations."
"In the de-
veloped Western European, Asian and North American mar-
kets, consumer trends such as beauty, health, well-being, 
convenience and naturalness determine the growing demand 
for products containing Symrise ingredients."

THE MARKET POSITION OF SYMRISE
Symrise is one of the largest companies in the AFF industry."
"In 
relation to the relevant market of € 40.0 billion, Symrise held 
a market share in 2023 of roughly 12 % in terms of sales."
"Symrise 
has expanded the traditional segments to include additional 
applications such as cosmetic ingredients in Scent & Care and 
pet food ingredients in Taste, Nutrition & Health."
"Greater val-
ue creation can be achieved on the basis of these more complex 
product solutions."
"In submarkets such as sun protection or 
other cosmetic ingredients, Symrise also competes with com-
panies or product segments of these companies that do not 
belong to the traditional AFF industry."
"Symrise has leading positions in certain market segments 
worldwide, for example, in mint and vanilla flavor compo-
sitions."
"Furthermore, Symrise is one of the leading companies 
in the manufacturing of nature-identical L-menthol and also 
holds a leading position in the segment of UV sun protection 
filters, fragrance ingredients, and in baby and pet food."
"GOALS AND STRATEGY
GOALS
In the long term, Symrise wants to strengthen its market po-
sition and ensure the independence of Symrise."

time, Symrise recognizes its responsibility toward the envi-
ronment, its employees and society at large."

tion, sourcing and care, and thereby minimize risk for the com-

"This will enable Symrise to gradu-
ally increase the distance between it and smaller competi-
tors and to gain market share."
"Value orientation: Symrise wants to consistently be counted 
among the most profitable companies in the industry."
"The Group aims to achieve an average EBITDA margin of 
20 % to 23 %."
"Performance results are described in more detail in the cor-
porate development section."
"Symrise ensures that its share-
holders have an appropriate share in the company’s success."
"The dividend policy is oriented toward the company’s profit-
ability."
"STRATEGY
The corporate strategy of Symrise is based on three pillars: 
growth, efficiency and portfolio."
"It incorporates aspects of sus-
tainability at all levels in order to enhance the Group’s value 
over the long term and minimize risks."
"In this way, Symrise is 
making sustainability an integral part of its business model 
and turning it into a clear competitive advantage."
"The goal is a 
completely integrated corporate strategy."
"Growth: Symrise strengthens cooperation with its strategic 
customers around the world and expands its business in 
emerging markets."
"The Group makes sure that it remains an 
innovation leader in its core competencies."
"This ensures its 
continued growth."
"Efficiency: Symrise continually improves its processes and 
focuses on products with a high level of value creation."
"With backward integration for key raw materials, Symrise 
ensures a consistent, high-quality supply of these materials 
in sufficient quantities and at set delivery conditions."
Symrise works cost-consciously in every division.
"This en-
sures the Group’s profitability."
"Portfolio: Symrise enhances its product portfolio and taps 
into new markets and related business activities."
"The Group 
continues to expand its expertise outside the traditional 
flavor and fragrances industry."
"This ensures its prominent 
market position."
"1 CAGR: compound annual growth rate
Symrise grows organically."
"When it makes sense, the Group en-
gages in expansive acquisitions or enters into strategic part-
nerships for product development."
"At the same time, Symrise 
wants to ensure that the Group remains capable of taking ad-
vantage of any growth opportunities that arise without jeop-
ardizing the company’s financial stability."
"VALUE-ORIENTED MANAGEMENT
Different variables are at play within the framework of value- 
oriented management 
2."
"The company is aiming for average 
organic sales growth of between 5 % and 7 % per year (CAGR) 
1 
in the long term."
"The EBITDA margin, for which Symrise has 
defined a strategic target of 20 % to 23 % (until 2025), serves as 
an indicator of the company’s profitability."
"In addition, the 
company introduced business free cash flow in 2018 as the pri-
mary internal control variable to assess its performance in 
 
order to strengthen the Group’s cash flow orientation."
"Symrise 
aims to continuously increase the business free cash flow, 
which consists of EBITDA, investments (including cash effects 
from leasing) and changes in working capital."
"Increasing the 
value of the company is accounted for in the remuneration sys-
tem for the Executive Board and selected managerial staff."
"In addition, Symrise attaches great importance to the Group’s 
financial stability."
"Management’s focus, therefore, is guided 
by these financial control parameters."
"Nonfinancial perfor-
mance indicators in the areas of environment, procurement,

"RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
GUIDELINES
In research and development (R & D), Symrise aims to connect 
the individual components of product development, such as 
market and consumer research, basic research and creation 
throughout the Group."
"In the Taste, Nutrition & Health seg-
ment, new development potential is actively fostered through 
an incubator approach."
"Essential research results are 
secured by way of stringent IP management in the form of 
patent and trademark protection."
"Furthermore, all R & D activi-
ties are geared to the guidelines of global mega trends, con-
sumer needs, customer requirements, naturalness & authenticity, 
sustainability, digitalization, innovation and cost efficiency."
"ORGANIZATION
From idea to marketable product, the innovation process at 
Symrise is organized around a uniform, stage gate process with 
decision filters, which has been implemented across the com-
pany."
"Here, more and more elements of agile project manage-
ment are being used."
"In this context, a uniform project man-
agement system was introduced for all business areas in the 
Taste, Nutrition & Health segment."
"A business plan contain-
ing exact project descriptions, including the project’s costs and 
resource usage, is developed for every project at Taste, Nutri-
tion & Health and Scent & Care."
"The research and development 
projects are also regularly evaluated based on criteria from 
the four pillars of the sustainability strategy (FISC) 
 and priori-
tized accordingly."
"As part of this process in 2023, the area of 
fair use of biodiversity was further developed according to the 
provisions of the Nagoya Protocol and anchored in our proj-
ect management processes."
"One future field is the utilization 
of legacy varieties of known agricultural raw materials in or-
der to preserve and expand biodiversity."
"Symrise is also an ac-
tive member of the OP2B consortium 1 of various industrial 
companies."
"The two segments at Symrise each manage their 
own R & D activities due to the varying requirements of their 
respective markets and customers."
"At the same time, technol-
ogies, processes and findings are made available to all seg-
ments, in order to achieve synergies and improve resource ef-
ficiency."
"Multiple R & D centers around the world ensure that 
the regional ac 
tivities of the segments are optimally supported."
"In addition, there is a hair re-
search center at the São Paulo site."
"Ingredients division carries out basic skin biology research on 
innovative skin models, thereby driving forward the preclin-
ical development of new cosmetic active ingredients."
"In the 
Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, R & D activities are orga-
nized according to the Food & Beverage and Pet Food divisions 
as well as the Business Incubation Group (BIG)."
"The majority 
of this segment’s R & D activities are located in Holzminden 
(Germany), Teterboro (USA), Singapore, Shanghai (China), 
 
Tokyo (Japan), Paris (France), Rennes (France), Elven (France), 
São Paulo (Brazil), and Lund (Sweden)."
"EXTERNAL COOPERATIONS
External cooperations and networks (Open Innovation) bring 
a considerable amount of additional approaches and ideas 
into the development process."
"Along with ideas from Open In-
novation, Symrise also maintains a global project network 
with industrial, institutional and academic partners that cov-
ers every step of the innovative process – from basic research 
to marketing concepts."
"Increasingly, tax 
rebate options are being used for research activities in France 
and Germany."
"Symrise has joined the Sustainable Food Initiative 
(SFI), founded by Wageningen University & Research, in which 
various universities and industrial companies conduct joint 
research in the field of future and sustainable food production."
"To this end, special statistical processes were op-
timized and applied, making a significant contribution to re-
ducing project development cycles."
"Symrise presented an ex-
ample of this way of working at the 21st FEI Cooperation Fo-
rum entitled “Characterization, processing and use of plant 
proteins – Concepts for foods of the future” held in Bonn on 
April 18, 2023."
"to produce 
taste active flavonoids with isovanilloid motif.” The further 
development of our citrus expertise is of great importance 
in light of the widespread use of these products in beverages, 
sweets and other foods."
"That is why the molecular-sensory 
decoding process developed by Symrise is crucial for the exact 
characterization of flavor molecules and their combinations."
"This information is used by our developers and application 
technologists to create authentic product solutions for our 
customers."
"The use of renewable raw materials is becoming increasingly 
important in continuing to evolve selected technologies for 
the formulation of fragrances and product solutions."
"In this 
regard, Taste, Nutrition & Health presented its current work on 
spray drying coacervates on plant protein at the 21st Gums 
and Stabilisers for the Food Industry Conference that took place 
in Greece in July 2023."
"The research and technology strategy is being implemented 
on the basis of various research platforms."
"A large number of 
key topics are being worked on with a special focus on sus-
tainability aspects."
"In 2023, a special focus was placed on the challenge 
of improving the taste of plant proteins as meat substitutes 
or for use in dairy products."
"Another focus is on reducing sugar 
in beverages and dairy products as well as in savory applica-
tions."
"In this context, the selection of varieties and new culti-
vation methods for a sustainable supply chain were developed 
and established for specific plant-based raw materials for the 
Taste Balancing product platform."
"Another focus of research 
in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment is the development 
and application of modern digital tools for the rapid and tar-
geted development of flavor solutions for selected food appli-
cations."
"The ProtiScan™ process – developed by Symrise for 
recording the flavor release from innovative food preparations 
made with vegetable protein – is noteworthy in this context 
and was developed further in 2023."
"This process enables a sig-
nificant reduction in project development times and forms a 
solid foundation for IT-based development concepts."
"In recent years, particular 
 
attention has been given to the development of digital predic-
tion tools to support flavor development and creation."
"A sig-
nificant portion of this work was continued and completed in 
2023 and grouped under the umbrella term “PropheSY”."
"In the Pet Food division, the Elven site was equipped with 
state- 
of-the-art extrusion equipment to develop more power-
ful and safer products."
"In addition, the VIDEKA® laboratory 
in Elven was designed for EAME customer support with shelf-
life studies, research and development and analytical require-
ments."
"This laboratory is used to carry out shelf-life studies for 
pet food and pet care compounds using the latest analytical 
instruments."
"In the Aqua business, an important focus of product develop-
ment was the utilization of shrimp shells as raw materials or 
functional ingredients."
"Projects for the development and ap-
plication of flavor enhancers for carnivorous fish species were 
continued."
"Probi and the Naturals business unit have launched a joint 
project to develop new symbiotic products containing live 
microorganisms and polyphenols extracted from fruits."
"With regard to its R & D strategy, the Scent & Care segment fo-
cuses on raw materials and technologies in accordance with 
the Fragrances division’s strategic research fields of captives 
and ingredients, delivery systems, health and emotion, and 
malodor."
"The strategic field of captives and ingredients is re-
searching individual perfume raw materials for the Fragrance 
and Oral Care business units."
"In the case of new synthetic 
substances (captives) based on petrochemicals and renewable 
raw materials, the focus is on floral, woody and musky fra-
grances."
"In respect of the captives based on natural raw mate-
rials such as roots, flowers and fruits, work is concentrated on 
the strategic fields of biodiversity essential oils, natural tech-
nologies (Supernature) and artisan."
"In 2023, Cocoa Shell Mad-
agascar, Neroli Oil Egypt, Supernature Sympep, Apple Symtrap, 
Strawberry Symtrap, Banana Symtrap and Blackcurrant Sym-
trap were added to the portfolio."
"Symrise has also added Natural Neo-
fresh® to its Neofresh platform to meet customers’ desire for 
sustainable products made from renewable raw materials."
"Having continued the development of its combined expertise 
in fragrances and pet food especially for dogs and cats in 
 
recent years, Symrise is now deploying these developments 
increasingly in direct customer projects."
"The marketing of Symcap BG® biodegradable capsules has 
generated a great deal of interest from some customers for use 
in fabric softeners."
"Research for capsules for fragrance oils 
is now heading to vegan capsules with improved efficacy for 
other areas of application as well."
"There is also growing cus-
tomer demand for vegan capsules."
"Symcap BG contains gelatin 
so an alternative raw material based on pea protein has been 
found and developed into the new Symcap BP capsule that is 
market-ready."
"There is also increasing demand for kosher 
and halal products."
"The Oral Care business unit has developed Fuji, a new cooling 
agent that is expected to be market-ready in 2024."
"Research for the Aroma Molecules division is focused on im-
proving existing manufacturing processes for market products 
such as menthol and on increasing process efficiency."
"In the Cosmetic Ingredients division, there is an interdisci-
plinary group of cell biologists, molecular biologists and micro-
biologists researching the human microbiome."
"The new re-
search area is investigating the benefits and risks of interac-
tions between humans and microorganisms, and is providing 
scientific and cross-divisional support in the development of 
new products for skin, scalp and oral care, or in the area of 
 
nutrition."
"The first products and product concepts have already 
been introduced to the market."
"In addition, in-depth analyses 
on healthy volunteers showed that neither multifunctional ac-
tive ingredients nor modern UV filters have an effect on the 
microbiome."
"In 2023, microbiome expertise was expanded to 
the armpit."
"The proprietary ex vivo model developed to iden-
tify active ingredients for deodorants was presented at a num-
ber of conferences, including the International Federation of 
Cosmetic Chemists and Scientists (IFSCC) Congress."
"It is ex-
pected that the first active substance based on the research 
model and the specific method will be market-ready in 2024."
"PATENTS AND AWARDS
The number of patents filed (34 new applications in 2023) is 
used to measure innovation results and quality and to evaluate 
global coverage and competitive impact."
"In 2023, as in previous years, Symrise research was recognized 
with awards for its high level of innovation."
"Launched in 
2023, the yarrow-based Supervisome® EPH received two awards: 
a European BSB Innovation Award in the “Cosmetics/Raw 
 
Materials/Actives” category and the Pure Beauty Award UK."
"The 
product is manufactured in a special process which extracts 
the juice from fresh, organically grown yarrow and spray dries 
it to yield a stable raw material that, when used in cosmetic 
products, is proven to give the skin a more even appearance."
"Also launched in 2023, SymProt’in™ Oat is manufactured by 
enzymatic extraction from organically grown oats and is rich 
in hydrolyzed proteins."
"Thanks to its special composition, 
the product helps to protect the structure of hair and received 
the BSB Award in the “Natural Products/Raw Materials/Actives” 
category."
"SymHair® Thermo, which was already launched in 
2022 and has garnered numerous awards, won the Pure Beauty 
Global Award in the “Best Ingredient” category."
"It is a sustain-
able product that combines carbohydrates with different chain 
lengths, providing outstanding protection for the hair against 
thermal damage."
"Launched back in 2020, Crinipan PMC green 
impressed another jury in 2023 to win the prestigious PCHi 
Fountain Award in the “Hair Care/Scalp Care Ingredient” cate-
gory."
"The product delivers proven efficacy against dandruff 
and satisfies consumer demands for environmentally compat-
ible products."
"The share of sales accounted for by R & D 
expenditures amounted to 5.6 %, a slight increase from 5.5 % 
in 2022."
"Compared to the previous periods (2019–2021), the share 
of R & D expenses as a percentage of sales shows a slightly de-
clining trend, which is mainly due to portfolio shifts towards 
less research-intensive areas."
"The capitalization rate for research and development activities 
remained immaterial in 2023 as in the previous year because 
the conditions for capitalization are generally only met at the 
conclusion of a project."
"This meant that a majority of the 
 
development costs incurred were recognized through profit 
or loss."
"In comparison to December 31, 2022 (12,043 employees), this 
represents an additional 392 employees."
"At 221, the number 
of apprentices and trainees was well above the previous year’s 
figure of 209."
"PERSONNEL STRATEGY
In 2023, Symrise revised its human capital strategy in line with 
the company’s corporate strategy."
"The human capital vision 
of “ONE HR – inspiring more people for sustainable corporate 
growth” focuses on our main priorities: organization, people, 
sustainability and corporate growth."
"People from over 80 na-
tions work in the Symrise organization alone."
"For us as a 
global company, diversity has the added value of creative and 
innovative cooperation in diverse teams."
"Equal opportunities 
are more important than ever, and promoting diversity is cen-
tral to the company’s success."
"Furthermore, promoting diver-
sity is essential to ensuring employee recruitment now and in 
the future."
"We put our commitment to diversity into practice with specific 
measures on both local and global level."
"Group strategic development of senior executives 
and employees
Our talent scouting and succession planning processes recon-
cile employees’ individual career ambitions with our divi-
sions’ organizational development."
"In this connection, we de-
fine key positions within the company that we consider to be 
essential and for which we must identify and develop potential 
successors in the context of career development."
"In our 
Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, we are developing leadership 
programs to build management skills such as transparency, 
trust, the eye-to-eye principle, courage and team spirit."
"We 
expect these skills to be important for preparing our future 
ex 
ecutives."
"At the same time, our training programs include 
methods such as coaching and mentoring."
"Mentors are in 
the unique position to pass on valuable experience to their 
mentees, who are usually younger."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, Symrise also continued to expand the 
topic area of modern and digital learning."
"Employees were 
provided with a global “Learning Management System” (LMS) 
and a digital learning platform (“Skillsoft”)."
"More than 5,000 
learning hours have now been completed worldwide on the 
Skillsoft platform."
"In our talent development, we ensure that there 
are many women among the participants."
"In this way, we in-
tentionally promote the preparation of young women for taking 
on greater management responsibility in our company."
"The 
pipeline of female senior executives has almost met the target 
we set for 2025."
"Equitable remuneration for women and men
In 2021, Symrise carried out a gender-specific analysis of the 
wages for the employees at its largest site in Germany."
"In the 
in-depth analysis on the subject of equal pay, comparable 
job groups were formed and pay differences were analyzed 
against the backdrop of whether there is possible discrimi-
nation in this area."
"For this purpose, aspects such as length 
of service, age, education and vocational training were con-
sidered, along with the requirements level and professional 
position."
"Training and education
Educating young people is of particular importance at Symrise."
"This is evidenced by multiple awards in company compari-
sons over the past four years."
"Symrise recruits qualified young 
individuals who it specifically trains with the company’s 
needs in mind, thus fulfilling its social obligation to the next 
generation."
"As of December 31, 2023, a total of 141 apprentices and trainees 
were employed at the sites in Germany, representing an in-
crease of 12 % compared to 2022 (126)."
"Depending on the occupation, training lasts two to three years."
"All trainees are taken on at least temporarily after complet-
ing their training if they meet the minimum requirements re-
garding the success of their training."
"With this investment in 
training, Symrise is meeting the demand for future specialists 
in chemical production and the laboratories as well as in 
commercial, marketing, IT and sales positions."
"Symrise also 
runs apprenticeship programs at other sites around the world 
with the goal of training and developing the young talents the 
company needs."
"Symrise constantly trains experts over a period of around three 
years at its own flavorist and perfumer school, where they 
master raw materials and their applications in Symrise prod-
ucts and then successfully use them in product development."
"In addition, our employees have a wide variety of opportunities 
for completing a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree along-
side their work through cooperation agreements with univer-
sities, academies and institutes."
"Remuneration levels are based only on an employee’s quali-
fication and the value they contribute to the company."
"Most of 
the workforce is paid on the basis of collective wage agree-
ments that are negotiated with the labor unions."
"Each year, we 
perform analyses at all our main sites to avoid any gender- 
specific differences in remuneration."
"The last official analysis 
in Germany was conducted in 2021."
"We regularly analyze 
equality indicators in France as well."
"Most of our companies 
there are subject to French legislation that requires gender 
equality reporting."
"An annual index is published for the com-
panies affected."
"In 2023, our companies in Rennes, Antrain, 
Elven and Clichy scored an average of 87 out of 100 points."
"The wage differences reflected in the absolute wage level may 
arise due to the job type."
"For example, shift workers are paid 
shift allowances that are not gender-specific."
"The regularly scheduled bargaining on our collective wage 
agreements in Germany took place in 2022."
"As part of the suc-
cessful negotiations, a collective wage agreement adapted to 
the economic challenges faced by companies and employees 
was concluded with a term of 18 months."
"This envisaged 
wage increases in January, July and December 2023."
"Moreover, 
Symrise paid all full-time employees an inflation bonus of 
€ 1,500 in December 2023."
"Symrise will also continue to give its employees covered by the 
collective wage agreement in Germany a share of the com-
pany’s profits."
"The possible profit-sharing bonus linked to the 
EBITDA margin was also increased for 2023 and 2024."
"For employees not covered by the collective wage agreement, 
separate global performance bonus plans apply to our managers 
with global or regional responsibilities."
"These support the 
achievement of the set corporate goals through results- and 
performance-based variable remuneration."
"Our creative 
 
employees are also included in this management and incentive 
system."
"So far, the on-
going geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have 
had only little impact on business development at Symrise."
"However, the continuing high level of inflation in the 2023 fis-
cal year led to in part significant cost increases at Symrise, 
 
accompanied by the consistent implementation of price rises."
"In March, Symrise launched a number of bioactives under the 
diana food™ brand for use in beauty from within products."
"The company is expanding its offer with the development of 
these differentiating and innovative nutricosmetic ingredi-
ents."
"The range includes a full line of solutions for skin condi-
tioning and anti-aging, skin brightening, as well as hair and 
nail care."
"It is composed of naturally sourced bioactives, such 
as collagen type I, vitamins C and A, and polyphenols from 
various fruits."
"This product range expands Symrise’s expertise 
to include solutions for skin care from within, complementing 
the company’s existing cosmetic ingredients offering."
"In May 2023, Symrise inaugurated the Little Red House as a cre-
ative center for fine fragrances in the heart of Shanghai, fur-
ther strengthening the company’s position on the key Chinese 
fragrance market."
"The Little Red House is located in The Roof, 
an iconic building in Shanghai’s Xuhui District."
"With the new 
hub, Symrise offers its customers a unique and inspiring 
space for developing and co-creating ideas and devising mod-
ern solutions in real time."
"The hub’s name – “Xiaohongwu” 
in Chinese – relates to the red Symrise logo, the red walls of 
the chosen location, the familiar concept of a home and The 
Little Red Book, a Chinese social media platform."
"It serves as a 
meeting place for fragrance creation and also offers space for 
market research, creative arts and olfactory culture, featuring 
exclusive events and cultural programs."
"In June, Symrise Cosmetic Ingredients opened a new Center 
of Expertise for Beauty & Home Care at the Symrise site in 
Clichy near Paris."
"It houses a microbiological laboratory ded-
icated to customer support for the EAME (Europe, Africa, 
 
Middle East) region as well as the Cosmetic Ingredients divi-
sion’s first  
application laboratory for home care products."
"This move strengthens Symrise’s position as a leading company 
in the development of cosmetic ingredients and innovative 
solutions for customers around the world."
"At the end of August, Symrise Pet Food inaugurated a new pro-
duction facility in Chapecó, Brazil."
"The state-of-the-art pro-
duction plant manufactures palatability solutions for dog and 
cat food and covers an area of more than 10,000 square me-
ters, making it the largest of its kind in Latin America and the 
largest producer of pet food palatability solutions worldwide."
"It features advanced technologies with full automation deliver-
ing high operational efficiency."
"With this facility, the com-
pany has greatly expanded its production capacities in Brazil in 
preparation for the growing demand for pet food in Brazil 
and other Latin American markets."
"In addition, the site will 
deliver a number of products to global markets."
"At the start of October, the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment 
launched its new SET Flavors™ brand."
"SET stands for selective 
enrichment technologies, which can be used alone or in com-
bination."
"In this way, valuable natural aroma components can 
be obtained from the side streams and byproducts of food 
processing."
"The efficient processes and advanced technologies 
enable Symrise to select and enrich aroma substances from 
byproducts."
"These can be used as raw materials to develop in-
novative and authentic flavor profiles."
"Symrise SET Flavors™ 
address consumer wishes concerning future sustainability and 
environmental requirements."
"At the end of October 2023, Symrise inaugurated Jardin Arabia, 
the new creative center for fine fragrances in the heart of 
Dubai."
"In this way, Symrise is strengthening its strategic foot-
hold in the thriving Middle Eastern fragrance market."
"The 
name “Jardin Arabia” pays homage to the region and the elegant 
building structure, at the same time, embodying its central 
location at the crossroads between Europe and Asia."
"The ele-
gant and inspiring collaborative hub is located in Internet 
City, Dubai’s innovation district near the iconic Palm neighbor-
hood."
"It showcases Symrise’s fine fragrance market expertise 
and strengthens the company’s creative approach."
"GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE COURSE OF BUSINESS 
AND ON THE GROUP’S NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL 
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Symrise Group generated sales of € 4,730 million in the 
2023 fiscal year."
"Sales increased by 2.4 % in the reporting 
currency compared to the previous year."
"Excluding portfolio 
effects, organic sales growth amounted to 7.9 %."
"At a total of 
€ 903 million, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depre-
138 
S Y M R I S E  A G
ciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA1) were € 18 million 
lower than the previous year’s figure of € 922 million 
2."
"This 
corresponds to a margin3 of 19.1 % (2022 
2: 20.0 %)."
"Net income attributable to the shareholders of Symrise AG 
amounted to € 340 million, which was € 66 million lower than 
the previous year’s figure 
2."
"Earnings per share were € 2.44 and 
thus € 0.47 below the previous year’s figure 
2 of € 2.91."
"In light of the overall good business performance, the 
 
Symrise AG Executive Board will, in consultation with the 
 
Supervisory Board, propose raising the dividend from 
€ 1.05 in the previous year to € 1.10 per share for the 2023 fiscal 
year at the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2024."
"A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND 
FORECAST COURSE OF BUSINESS 
At the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year, Symrise had set itself 
the goal of achieving organic sales growth of 5 % to 7 % and 
thus noticeably above market growth (approx."
"This 
growth target was confirmed at the end of the first half."
"Please refer to the 
“Alternative performance indicators” section on page 143 for details about the adjustments."
"2 Excluding impairment of the associated company Swedencare AB, Malmö, Sweden
2.6 % because inflation-related price effects were offset by 
slight volume declines."
"For 2023, Symrise had expected an EBITDA margin of around 
20 % despite rising raw material prices."
"Debt, as measured 
by the key indicator of net debt (including provisions for pen-
sions and similar obligations as well as lease liabilities) to 
EBITDA, should have been within the range of 2.5 and 2.7."
"For 
the business free cash flow in relation to sales, Symrise had 
set itself a target of 12 % at the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year."
"In its reporting for the first half of 2023, Symrise lowered its 
expectation for business free cash flow for the 2023 fiscal year 
to between 9 % and 11 %."
"With organic sales growth of 7.9 % (excluding portfolio and cur-
rency translation effects), Symrise surpassed its sales goals 
in 2023."
"The adjusted EBITDA margin 
3 of 19.1 % was below the 
value expected for 2023."
"At 3.0 times EBITDA3, net debt was 
higher than the level expected for 2023, due especially to the 
weaker earnings performance and the still high working 
capital to ensure supply availability."
"On the reporting date, the 
adjusted business free cash flow 
3 was 11.7 % and thus higher 
than the target of 9 % to 11 % forecast at the end of the first half."
"3  
Adjusted for one-time effects; please refer to the “Alternative performance indicators” section 
on page 143 for details about the adjustments."
"Taking account of portfolio and currency 
translation effects, the segment’s sales in the reporting curren-
cy amounted to € 2,978 million."
"Compared to the previous 
year, this corresponds to an increase of 2.2 %."
"The positive port-
folio effect from the acquisition of Wing Biotechnology Co., 
Ltd., Shanghai, China, was around € 20 million."
"In the Food & Beverage division, the business units responsible 
for sweet and savory products and for beverage flavoring 
 
developed very positively, all achieving high single-digit and 
double-digit organic growth, respectively."
"The EAME (Europe, 
Africa, Middle East) and Latin America regions in particular 
saw strong gains."
"The main growth drivers here were the mar-
kets of Western and Eastern Europe, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as 
well as Mexico and Brazil."
"The Naturals business unit in-
creased sales in the EAME and Asia/Pacific regions especially."
The Pet Food division also posted double-digit organic growth.
"Sales development was particularly dynamic in the Western 
and Eastern European markets, especially Poland and France, as 
well as in the USA, Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia, driven 
especially by global and regional customers."
"With the ongoing 
expansion of production capacities and the joint venture 
with Fujian Sunner Development Co."
"in China (Sunner), 
Symrise has laid the foundation for the continued acceler-
ated growth of the pet food business."
"Sales by the Aqua Feed division also developed positively 
to deliver double-digit organic growth."
"Key growth impulses 
came from the EAME and Asia/Pacific regions, especially 
from the markets in Germany, China, Portugal and South Korea."
"The probiotics business, which includes the majority interest 
in the listed company Probi AB, Lund, Sweden, was unable to 
maintain the level of the previous year and recorded a slight 
decline in sales."
"This was due to general market weakness, es-
pecially in North America."
"Sales development in EAME also 
saw a negative impact from the reduction in safety stocks by 
a number of major customers."
"EBITDA Taste, Nutrition & Health: Adjusted EBITDA1 of the 
Taste, Nutrition & Health segment in the reporting year 
amounted to € 627 million, which was lower than in the pre-
vious year 
2 (2022: € 631 million)."
"This was mainly attributable 
to the lack of the previous year’s positive one-time effects 
from the sale of the Velcorin® business and the partial sale of 
the celery business and to higher operating costs."
"Due to 
the aforementioned effects, the adjusted EBITDA margin 
1 of 
21.0 % failed to match the previous year’s 
2 level (2022: 21.6 %)."
"Compared to the previous year, this rep-
resents an increase of 2.7 %."
"Excluding portfolio and currency 
translation effects, organic sales growth amounted to 5.6 %."
"The portfolio effects from the acquisitions of Neroli Invest 
DL (Groupe Néroli) and Essence Ciel with its subsidiary SFA 
Romani (Romani) – both are based in Saint-Cézaire-sur-
Siagne, France – contributed a total of around € 15 million."
"The Fragrance division increased sales organically by a high 
single-digit percentage."
"The Fine Fragrances business in partic-
ular continued its dynamic development and followed its 
strong performance of the previous year with renewed double- 
digit percentage organic growth."
"The recent acquisitions also 
contributed to the business unit’s growth."
"The growth rates in 
the EAME, North America and Latin America regions were 
particularly pronounced."
"The Consumer Fragrances business 
unit posted good single-digit percentage growth."
"Here, too, 
the biggest gains were posted by the EAME and Latin America 
regions, followed by Asia/Pacific, especially for laundry and 
cleaning products."
"The Oral Care business unit saw low single- 
digit percentage organic growth, with the biggest increases 
in the Asia/Pacific region."
"Sales development in the Aroma Molecules division was nega-
tively impacted in particular by a difficult market environment 
and the production stoppage at Colonel Island, USA, following 
a fire in November 2022."
"Demand for fragrances and menthol 
was held back by customers reducing their inventories."
"The 
sum of sales across all business units and regions was signifi-
cantly lower than in the previous year."
"Sales by the Cosmetic Ingredients division continued to de-
velop very positively, again posting double-digit percentage 
organic growth, especially in the EAME and Latin America 
 
regions."
"Sales also increased in North America and Asia/Pacific 
but by a smaller single-digit percentage."
"The strongest growth 
was posted by the sun protection business and the Micro Pro-
tection business unit."
"EBITDA Scent & Care: In 2023, Scent & Care generated adjusted 
EBITDA1 of € 277 million, which was 4.9 % lower than in the 
previous year (2022: € 291 million), due especially to increased 
raw material prices and higher operating costs."
"As a result, 
the adjusted EBITDA margin 
1 decreased to 15.8 % from 17.1 % in 
2022."
"Sales 
 
development in North America saw a significant negative im-
pact from the production stoppage at Colonels Island."
"In or-
ganic terms, the region’s sales were 1.8 % lower than in the pre-
vious year."
"The Asia/Pacific region achieved organic sales 
growth of 4.0 % compared to the previous year."
"Sales develop-
ment in Latin America was dynamic and delivered organic 
growth of 14.7 % compared to the previous year."
"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIAL LINE ITEMS IN THE 
INCOME STATEMENT
Despite the good sales development, earnings performance 
in the 2023 fiscal year remained below expectations."
"The cost 
of goods sold increased slightly faster than sales, which was 
mainly attributable to higher raw material and manufacturing 
costs."
"The gross margin in the reporting year was 36.8 %, vir-
tually level with the previous year’s figure of 36.9 %."
"The share 
of selling and marketing expenses in Group sales declined 
from 14.7 % in 2022 to 14.2 % in the reporting year."
"This decrease 
was primarily attributable to lower logistics costs."
"Compared 
to the previous year, the R & D rate relative to sales increased 
from 5.5 % to 5.6 %, due especially to higher expenses for ba-
sic research in both segments."
"Administration expenses as a 
share of Group sales grew from 5.6 % a year earlier to 5.8 % in 
the reporting year, in particular as a result of increased IT sys-
tem costs."
"Moreover, earnings were depressed by negative currency 
translation effects and smaller contributions from companies 
accounted for using the equity method."
"Adjusted EBITDA1 amounted to € 903 million, € 18 million lower 
than the previous year’s value 
2 (2022: € 922 million)."
"The 
 
adjusted EBITDA margin 
1 of 19.1 % was also below the previous 
year’s value 
2 of 20.0 %."

FUTURE COMPANY DEVELOPMENT
For 2024, Symrise is reaffirming its long-term growth and 
profitability goals."
"The Group remains confident that it will 
continue to grow at a faster pace than the relevant market."
"According to IAL Consultants, the forecast long-term growth 
of the relevant market is around 3 % to 4 % worldwide."
"For 
the Group, expected long-term growth of 5 % to 7 % (CAGR) re-
mains unchanged and is also anticipated to be achieved in 
2024."
"The company aims to generate sales of € 5.5 to 6.0 billion 
by the end of 2025."
"In addition, Symrise recently extended 
its long-term growth expectation to 2028 and aims to generate 
sales of € 7.5 to 8.0 billion by that time."
"Moreover, the develop-
ment of innovative sustainable products and technologies con-
tinues to be a fundamental aspect of the Symrise strategy."
"Assuming that prices for raw materials remain largely stable, 
the Group expects an EBITDA margin for 2024 of around 20 %, 
which is at the lower end of the target corridor."
"In the medium 
term, the Group is seeking to maintain an EBITDA margin 
between 20 % and 23 %."
"The ratio of net debt (including provi-
sions for pensions and similar obligations as well as lease 
 
liabilities) to EBITDA should be between 2.6 and 2.8 at the end 
of 2024."
"For the business free cash flow, the Group is aiming 
for a rate relative to sales of 12 % in 2024."
"The medium-term 
target is a rate of 14 %."
"The company will continue its earnings-oriented dividend 
policy and give its shareholders an appropriate share in the 
company’s success."
"GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE COMPANY’S 
EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT
The Executive Board at Symrise AG sees the company as being 
optimally positioned to continue developing in every divi-
sion and growth region."
"A proven strategy will be used to 
achieve the goals set."
"The three pillars of the strategy remain 
unchanged."
"Where it is expe-
dient and creates added value, the Group will make acquisitions 
or forge strategic alliances to ensure access to new techno-
logies, new markets and customers or ensure that it can obtain 
sustainable, renewable raw materials."
"The future 
course of business and the results actually achieved by Symrise AG and its affi
  liates are subject to a large number of risks and uncertainties 
and may therefore diff
 er substantially from the forward-looking statements."
"Many of these factors are outside of Symrise AG’s sphere of 
infl
 uence and cannot be assessed in detail ahead of events."
"They include, for example, unfavorable development of the global economy, 
a change in consumer behavior, and changes to laws, regulations and offi
  cial guidelines."
"Should one of these uncertainty factors, named or 
otherwise, occur or should the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based prove to be incorrect, the actual results 
may diff
 er signifi
 cantly from the results anticipated."
"Symrise undertakes no obli 
gation to update forward-looking statements contin 
uously 
and to adjust them to future events or devel 
opments."
