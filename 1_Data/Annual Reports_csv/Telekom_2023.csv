To our shareholders
Letter from the Chair of the Board of Management
Dear shareholders,
Dear friends of Deutsche Telekom,
2023 was complex and challenging."
"In these uncertain times, the calls to focus exclusively on ourselves are growing louder."
We often hear that people are overwhelmed by the complexity of interdependencies.
"That their worries about the future are
being ignored by politicians."
As is their need for safety and security.
That nations can’t act because their hands are tied.
"It is
effective rhetoric."
Extreme views are gaining traction because they offer easy answers and promise even easier solutions.
"Yet
it is a fallacy to believe that such ideologies would effect positive change."
"Just as it is to believe that greater isolation and less
migration begets prosperity."
"One of our biggest strengths as Europe lies in integrating people from diverse backgrounds, who possess wide-ranging talents
and skills, into our working environment."
We offer them an opportunity for inclusion in our free and democratic society.
"In
return, they apply their talent and productivity to helping maintain this basic order."
"The resulting social cohesion is fundamental
to modern, functioning, and diverse democracies."
"It makes us happy that people of all religions, genders, and cultures, from across all four corners of the globe, come together
at Deutsche Telekom for our customers."
"This helps not only our Company to grow, but also each individual to grow personally."
Many people working at Deutsche Telekom have a migratory background.
They do a great deal for our Company.
"Against this backdrop, it is even more important that hundreds of thousands of people Germany-wide took to the streets
in support of civil liberties and diversity in January 2024."
Because that is the hallmark of a vibrant civil society.
"Dear shareholders,
In these uncertain times, Deutsche Telekom has kept doing what it does best: It showed stability over the last year."
Ran its business successfully.
"And – like in the years before – rose to its responsibility as a stabilizing element
of our society."
You could also say: we never stop trying to live up to the trust that people place in us.
"This is decisive for
Deutsche Telekom."
Our businesses continue on their growth course.
"We are keenly focused on pursuing our transformation into the Leading Digital
Telco."
"We stay on our chosen path, our sights set on what is ahead."
And we remain optimistic.
The year just ended gives us good reason to be.
2023 was an outstanding year for Deutsche Telekom in terms of performance.
We improved our key financial figures on both sides of the Atlantic.
Our adjusted EBITDA AL grew by 0.7 % to EUR 40.5 billion.
"In organic terms, we grew by 4.0 %."
Free cash flow AL increased by 40.7 % to EUR 16.1 billion.
"This puts us ahead of our guidance
for the 2023 financial year."
The primary reason for this: more and more people worldwide trust in Deutsche Telekom and its products.
"In the United
States, our subsidiary T‑Mobile US once again delivered industry-leading customer growth and earnings."
"Ahead of long-time
incumbents Verizon and AT&T."
"Across the entire year, our colleagues won around 5.7 million new customers for a mobile
communications contract with our U.S."
"T‑Mobile US remains the number one for customer growth on the most
important mobile communications market globally."
"More than 300 million people can access T‑Mobile US’ ultra-fast 5G
network, the country’s best mobile infrastructure."
The most important foundation for future growth is therefore in place.
"Since 2023, we have held the majority stake in this industry-leading network."
"Taking the treasury shares held by T‑Mobile US
into account, our ownership stake in T‑Mobile US was over 50 % at the end of 2023."
"We also have strategically expanded
our ownership position in T‑Mobile US by way of a capital increase from the agreement we reached with SoftBank in 2021."
"To achieve this, our shareholders accepted that the capital increase would have a minor dilutive effect on their share in
Deutsche Telekom."
"We intend to reverse this effect in part with our share buy-back, which we have begun in 2024."
"We are now
honoring the trust of our shareholders, exactly as we said we would."
I can only reiterate the strategic relevance of the U.S.
We are strong in the United States.
"With the integration
of Sprint almost complete, we are now seeing strong growth in earnings and free cash flow at our T‑Mobile US – exactly
as we planned."
"Since 2019, the year before the business combination with Sprint, T‑Mobile US has more than doubled its
adjusted EBITDA and more than tripled its free cash flow."
"The company’s market capitalization has almost tripled since then,
and the value of our stake has substantially more than doubled."
"Since the fourth quarter of 2023, T‑Mobile US also has started
paying a dividend."
This aids our record investments in Germany and in our European subsidiaries.

On our home continent, we have been at the top of our industry for many years."
"The “T” shines out in Germany and in our
national companies."
"We intend to build on this leading position by winning more and more people with the best network
experience, and offering them the best connectivity with high-speed internet and best-in-class service."
Our technicians and engineers brought us closer to this goal over the past year.
"They pushed themselves to the limits of
their abilities, setting yet another new record for the build-out of fiber to the home (FTTH): last year, Deutsche Telekom gave
more than 2.5 million households in Germany access to a fiber-optic line."
"This brought the total number of households able to
connect to our FTTH network to around 8 million at the end of 2023."
We will pass the 10 million mark in 2024.
"Our 5G build-out, too, is industry-leading."
"At present, around 96 % of the population of Germany can access our 5G mobile
network, thanks to more than 80,000 antennas across Germany transmitting 5G, 10,000 of these using the ultra-fast 3.6 GHz
band."
"In the long term, nationwide coverage with the networks of the future – optical fiber and 5G – is decisive for safeguarding
Germany’s future as a place to do business."
"We want to play our part in ensuring that all households in Germany have access
to a fiber-optic line with gigabit speeds by 2030."
"In concrete terms, we intend to build out more than 25 million lines."
"But this
is a gargantuan task, and our competitors must also pull their weight."
"Deutsche Telekom can contribute, but it cannot digitalize
Germany singlehandedly."
Our “T” is now one of the top 10 most valuable brands worldwide.
"We are ninth in the ranking, and the most valuable brand in
Europe."
The latest Brand Finance report values the “T” at USD 73.3 billion.
"This success places Deutsche Telekom in an exclusive
circle that includes global tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google, who occupy the top three spots, highlighting the depth
of strength in the technology sector."
"In this dynamic environment, it is all the more impressive that Deutsche Telekom is now considered the most valuable
telecommunications brand worldwide."
"This result is validation of our investments in the best networks, best service, and our
commitment to digital technologies, as well as the work of our people."
"Deutsche Telekom is more than just a company that
stands for the promise: Connecting your world."
"Today, it is THE provider to the Western world."
"Dear shareholders,
We also saw the price of the T-Share perform impressively well over the past year."
"After passing the EUR 20 mark in 2023 for
the first time in several years, in January 2024 our share price hit EUR 23.22, its highest level for more than 22 years."
"At 20.3 %,
total shareholder return for the entire year 2023 – i.e., including re-invested dividends – is on par with development of the
DAX 40."
"Over a three-, five-, and even ten-year horizon, an investment in T-Shares has outperformed both an investment in the
DAX and in all major European industry peers."
We want those who have shown confidence in us to also participate in this success: our shareholders.
"Many of them have
remained loyal to us for decades, and we have weathered some storms together."
"Without them, our investors,
Deutsche Telekom as it stands today would not exist."
"On the basis of the strong earnings performance, we intend to increase
the dividend for the 2023 financial year to EUR 0.77 per share."
"Provided we get the approval of the shareholders’ meeting, of
course."
"Just like last year, this is an increase of 10 %, and this step is in line with our communicated dividend policy."
"It is yet
further testimony to Deutsche Telekom’s dependability and stability."
"This is further corroborated by the rating agencies: Our major ratings are once again within our target range of BBB+/Baa1 with
a stable outlook."
The average share price set by the stock analysts tracking us is well over EUR 26.
"This also shows the huge
confidence the financial market has in us."
"Dear shareholders,
Despite the complex circumstances, our results for 2023 are excellent."
That’s an outstanding achievement.
"But we are not
complacent about our success."
We can see how rapidly new technologies like artificial intelligence are rising to prominence.
And we have identified where we must step on the gas if we want to be the Leading Digital Telco worldwide.
"We are taking the
necessary action."
"For instance, with our Global Telco AI Alliance with SK Telecom, e&, and Singtel."
"But at the same time, we act with caution and adhere to our ethical principles."
"Just so our customers know: Around 200,000
people work at Deutsche Telekom worldwide, and they take their responsibility seriously."
"With them, we are in the best hands,
including when it comes to critical topics like artificial intelligence."
We trust in Deutsche Telekom.
"Best regards,
Tim Höttges

Supervisory Board’s report to the 2024 shareholders’ meeting
Dear shareholders,
The 2023 financial year was characterized by the further implementation of the Group strategy and the Group’s ongoing
transformation in an age of digitalization and technological change."
"With its strategy to transform Deutsche Telekom into
the Leading Digital Telco, the Company is well positioned to leverage future opportunities and face challenges head on."
"In the financial year just ended, the Board of Management closed numerous transactions serving to further optimize and
protect the Company’s investment portfolio."
"In the 2023 financial year, business developed well overall."
"Deutsche Telekom
successfully manages the challenges caused by geopolitical tensions, increased energy prices, and high inflation with the
requisite discipline."
"The network build-out was ramped up further and the Company again underscored its ability to perform
at the top level with special offerings for customers and its strong commitment to service."
"The Group held its own in the
challenging environment despite the rising intensity of competition."
"Strong results brought the 2023 financial year to a
successful close."
The Group continues on its course for growth while maintaining its industry-leading position.
"Deutsche Telekom became the most valuable company brand in Europe and consequently also in Germany for the first time
ever in 2023."
"Furthermore, the Company continued to live up to its responsibility to society in this financial year, for example,
by supporting people in and from areas affected by crisis, including Ukraine, Turkey, Syria, and Israel, and by pursuing ambitious
sustainability targets."
"The Supervisory Board exercised its functions as an advisory and supervisory body and gave the Board of
Management its full support."
"Supervisory Board activities in the 2023 financial year
We continually supervised and supported the Board of Management in its management of the Company by providing advice."
"Specifically, this consisted of ensuring that the Board of Management’s activities were lawful, compliant, appropriate,
strategically relevant, sustainable, and efficient."
"The Board of Management’s written and oral reports formed the essential basis for the fulfillment of the Supervisory Board’s
tasks and duties under the law, the Articles of Incorporation, and the Rules of Procedure."
The Board of Management fulfilled its duties to inform quickly and in full.
"The Board of Management’s reports met all statutory
requirements, the standards of good corporate governance, and the criteria imposed on them by us with regard to both content
and scope."

and verified the plausibility of these reports and other information."

which the Board of Management has to obtain approval from the Supervisory Board."
"We met with the Board of Management to
discuss and thoroughly review the business transactions and measures presented to us in the 2023 financial year for approval
in line with this document."
We approved the transactions and measures submitted for resolution.
The frequency of plenary and committee meetings means that we are in close contact with the Board of Management.
"The
Board of Management also reports on individual issues in writing or in discussions between the meetings."
"In the 2023 financial year, seven Supervisory Board plenary meetings were held as well as one off-site conference, and
23 meetings of the Supervisory Board committees took place."
"Detailed information concerning the form in which these
meetings were held (face to face/virtual) is provided below."
The overall attendance rate was around 97 %.
"In total, each of the
Supervisory Board members attended more than 75 % of the plenary meetings and the meetings of the respective committees
on which they sit."
"Those members who were unable to attend meetings were generally able to participate nonetheless by
submitting their votes in writing or by way of prior briefings on resolutions for decision."

Innovation Committee, to take account of the correlation between innovation and ESG topics and our strategy."
"Additionally, the
Audit Committee and the Finance Committee have been combined to form the new Audit and Finance Committee to holistically

corporate success."
The provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code are hence reflected in the Company’s statutes.

Governance Code on December 30, 2023."
This Declaration of Conformity can be found on the Deutsche Telekom AG website.

"Training and development
The members of the Supervisory Board generally take on the necessary training and further education measures required
for their tasks on their own."
"Deutsche Telekom offers supporting information events and workshops – in 2023 the main
focus was on artificial intelligence, ESG requirements, compliance, and sustainability reporting – delivered by experts from
within and outside the Company."
"Company visits and presentations of the product innovations are additionally arranged and
offered to the Supervisory Board members to enhance their understanding of the Company."
"They also inform themselves
and undergo continued training on current topics both within and outside of the Supervisory Board’s meetings."
"The Company
offers new Supervisory Board members a customized program to introduce them to the industry and the situation of the
Company."
"The members of the
Supervisory Board are also kept up to date about any new requirements for work on the Supervisory Board at the regular Board

"We would like to thank all members of the Supervisory Board who have left in the past financial year for their successful long-
term, constructive collaboration."
"The combined management report also included a separate section containing the combined non-financial statement for
Deutsche Telekom AG and for the Group (combined non-financial statement) for the 2023 financial year."
"The external auditor
issued an unqualified audit opinion for each document."
"The external auditor confirmed its independence in writing to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board together with
the submission of the audit reports."
"There are no circumstances that may give rise to doubts about the external auditor’s
impartiality."
"In the Supervisory Board meeting on February 22, 2024, the Audit Committee informed us about its monitoring
of the external auditor’s independence while taking account of the non-audit services provided, and of its conclusion that the
auditor continues to meet the independence requirements."
The external auditor submitted its reports on the nature and extent as well as the result of its audits (audit reports) to us.
"The
aforementioned documentation on the financial statements, the external auditor’s preliminary audit reports, and the Board of
Management’s proposal for the appropriation of net income were made available to the members of the Supervisory Board in
good time."
The same applies to the combined non-financial statement and the Corporate Governance Statement.
"We conducted our own in-depth review of the documents submitted by the Board of Management and the external auditor’s
audit reports."
"In preparation, the Audit Committee had conducted a thorough review of the aforementioned documents."
"The
documentation on the financial statements and the Board of Management’s proposal for the appropriation of net income were
explained in detail by the Board of Management to the members of the Audit Committee at its meeting on February 21, 2024."
The members of the Board of Management also answered the committee members’ questions.
"Moreover, the external auditor
also attended this meeting and reported on its audit, in particular the focal points of the audit defined in agreement with the
Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, and the main findings of its audit, and explained its preliminary audit reports."
"The
members of the Audit Committee acknowledged and critically reviewed the preliminary audit reports and preliminary audit
opinions, and discussed them, as well as the audit itself, with the external auditor."
"The review included questions about the
nature and extent of the audit and about the audit findings."
"The Audit Committee satisfied itself that the audit and the audit
reports were compliant."
"In particular, its members had assured themselves that the audit reports and the audit conducted by
the external auditor met the legal requirements."
"The external auditor then issued its final audit reports without any changes
and issued an unqualified audit opinion for each of the financial statements."
"Furthermore, the Audit Committee adopted the
aforementioned approach with respect to the audit report and audit opinion on the combined non-financial statement and

Deloitte then issued this report along with an unqualified audit opinion.
"The Board of Management attended this meeting, explained
the documents they had submitted, and answered our questions."
"The external auditor also attended this meeting and reported
on its audit and the main findings of its audit, explained its audit reports, and answered our questions, in particular relating to
the nature and extent of the audit and the audit findings."
"Based on this and the report presented by the Audit Committee, we
were satisfied that the audit and the audit report were compliant."
"Hence, we approved the findings of the audit by the external
auditor."
The same applies to the combined non-financial statement contained in the combined management report.
"The same applies to the Corporate Governance Statement even
insofar as it has not been audited by the external auditor."
"We followed the Audit Committee’s recommendation and approved
the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2023."
"The 2023 annual financial statements are
therefore formally adopted."
"The Supervisory Board’s assessment of the position of the Company and the Group is the same as that which the Board
of Management presented in its combined management report."
"It followed the Audit Committee’s recommendation and
approved these documents."
The same applies to the combined non-financial statement.
"When dealing with the budget and medium-term planning on December 12, 2023, we conducted an in-depth examination
of financial and investment plans, discussing in particular the development of earnings, free cash flow, the equity ratio, and
balance sheet ratios."
"The Board of Management’s proposal concerning the appropriation of net income was examined by the
Audit Committee on February 21, 2024, and by the Supervisory Board on February 22, 2024."
"The external auditor was present
at both meetings."
"We approved and supported the Board of Management’s proposal to pay out shareholder remuneration of
around EUR 3,827 million and to carry forward around EUR 8,485 million to unappropriated net income."
"The remuneration report for the 2023 financial year was prepared by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board in
accordance with § 162 (1) sentence 1 of the Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) and reviewed separately by the

"Development of international indexes
Following a weak year in 2022, it was all systems go on the stock markets in 2023."
"Around the world, indexes rose substantially,
with just a few exceptions."
"Declining inflationary pressure and stagnating energy prices, as well as moderate growth in interest
rates boosted share price performance."
"The DAX 40 – as a total return index, i.e., including reinvested dividends – climbed 20.3 % over the course of the year."
"In the
same period, the Dow Jones rose by 13.7 %, or by 16.2 % including reinvested dividends."
"The Nikkei, which had declined sharply in the prior year, recovered strongly in 2023, climbing by 28.2 %."
"The Dow Jones
EURO STOXX 50® also grew significantly, rising 22.2 %."
"T-Share performance
Growth in the European telecommunications sector was clearly more restrained: The industry’s barometer, the Dow Jones
STOXX® Europe 600 Telecommunications, rose just 8.1 % by the end of 2023."
"The T-Share recorded a much stronger performance, closing 2023 at EUR 21.75, up 16.6 %."
"The lowest price recorded during
the year was EUR 18.56 on August 8, 2023, while the highest price of EUR 23.05 was recorded on April 5, 2023."
On a total return basis – and thus comparable with the DAX – our share also ended the year 2023 up 20.3 %.
"For an overview of the performance of the T-Share in recent years, please visit our Investor Relations website."
"Dividend
The Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG will propose to the shareholders’ meeting on April 10, 2024 the distribution

"In November 2023, we announced
that we will buy back shares in Deutsche Telekom AG in 2024 up to a total purchase price of EUR 2 billion under a share buy-
back program."
"The buy-back started on January 3, 2024."
"Capital markets communication
Deutsche Telekom maintains a close dialog with participants on the capital market and is monitored and analyzed by a number
of German and international analysts (coverage)."
"As of December 31, 2023, we recorded 21 analyst recommendations, 90 % of
these with a buy recommendation, 5 % with a hold recommendation, and 5 % with a sell recommendation."
"For a current overview of analyst coverage, please visit our Investor Relations website."
"The dialog with our institutional investors was maintained through participation in numerous conferences as well as by holding

The further strengthened focus on digital channels within Deutsche Telekom’s capital markets communication received very
positive feedback: the redesigned Investor Relations website was named Best Investor Relations Website in the DAX 40

A Company presentation that is updated each quarter is published on this website.
"The
number of video views and the duration of playback time on the Investor Relations YouTube channel almost doubled year-on-

"High-value service revenue increased by 1.0 % to EUR 92.9 billion; in organic terms, the
increase was 3.6 %."
"Our Germany segment increased revenue by 2.8 % year-on-year, and by 2.1 % on an organic basis,
on the back of the strong development of service revenues and partnership business."
"In the United States segment, revenue declined by 4.0 %, partly due to exchange rate effects."
"In
organic terms, the decline of 0.8 % was due in part to the decrease in terminal equipment revenue."
"Revenue in our Europe segment grew by 5.7 %, and by 4.8 % on an organic basis, on account of
higher mobile service revenues."
"Revenue in Systems Solutions was up 2.2 % year-on-year, and by 5.3 % in organic terms, on the
back of growth in the Road Charging, Digital, Advisory, and Cloud portfolio areas."
"In Group Development, revenue declined significantly due to the sale of T‑Mobile Netherlands and
GD Towers; in organic terms, revenue increased by 3.2 %."
Adjusted EBITDA AL grew by 0.7 % to EUR 40.5 billion.
"In organic terms, it increased by 4.0 %."
"In our Germany segment, adjusted EBITDA AL was up 4.1 %, driven by high-value revenue growth
and enhanced cost efficiency."
"In the United States, adjusted EBITDA AL increased by 3.1 %."
"In organic terms, the increase was
largely due to a 5.2 % cut in costs."
Adjusted core EBITDA AL grew by 7.6 % to EUR 26.1 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA AL in the Europe segment grew by 3.8 % due to a positive net margin.
"In Systems Solutions, adjusted EBITDA AL grew by 13.0 %, mainly due to increased revenue in our
Road Charging and Digital portfolio areas."
"In Group Development, adjusted EBITDA AL declined significantly due to the sale of T‑Mobile
Netherlands and GD Towers."
"At 36.2 %, the Group’s adjusted EBITDA AL margin increased by 1.1 percentage points against the
prior-year level."
"The adjusted EBITDA AL margin was 40.6 % in the Germany segment, 36.5 % in
the United States segment, and 34.9 % in the Europe segment."
EBIT increased by EUR 17.6 billion to EUR 33.8 billion.
Special factors had a positive effect of EUR 10.7 billion on EBITDA AL (2022: EUR -4.2 billion).
"Deconsolidations, disposals, and acquisitions generated proceeds of EUR 12.2 billion, most of
which was attributable to the sale of GD Towers."
"By contrast, the integration costs from the
merger of T‑Mobile US and Sprint decreased compared with the prior year."
"At EUR 24.0 billion, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses were EUR 3.9 billion lower
than in the prior-year, with the decrease being almost exclusively attributable to the United States
and Group Development segments."
"The impairment losses amounted to EUR 0.2 billion and related primarily to the Systems Solutions
and the Group Headquarters & Group Services segments."
"The impairment losses recorded in the
prior year of EUR 1.2 billion were mainly attributable to the former Sprint’s fiber-optic-based
wireline assets in the United States segment."
Net profit increased by EUR 9.8 billion to EUR 17.8 billion.
"Our loss from financial activities increased from EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 8.8 billion, due mainly to
interest rate-based impairment losses, reducing the share of profit/loss of associates and joint
ventures accounted for using the equity method, primarily GD Towers."
"Other financial income/
expense additionally decreased in connection with the measurement of provisions and liabilities,
as well as gains/losses from financial instruments."
"Finance costs were negatively impacted partly
as a result of the sale and leaseback of passive network infrastructure in Germany and Austria in
connection with the sale of GD Towers."
Tax expense came to EUR 3.0 billion compared with EUR 2.2 billion in the prior year.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests increased from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 4.2 billion.
Adjusted earnings per share amounted to EUR 1.60 compared with EUR 1.83 in the prior year.
"By contrast, we use the management approach for the presentation in the
combined management report, i.e., the results of operations include the value contributions from GD Towers up to and including January 2023."
"For information on the sale of GD Towers, please
refer to the section “Group organization” in the combined management report and the section “Changes in the composition of the Group and other transactions” in the consolidated financial

ROCE (return on capital employed) increased by 4.5 percentage points to 9.0 %.
"This was due to
significant growth in net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT), while the average amount of net
operating assets (NOA) remained almost constant over the year."
"The positive development in NOPAT is largely due to a significant increase in special factors,
particularly from the sale of GD Towers."
"In addition, the integration costs from the merger of
T‑Mobile US and Sprint decreased compared with the prior year."
"NOPAT was reduced by
impairment losses on our stake in GD Towers."
Net debt decreased by EUR 10.1 billion to EUR 132.3 billion.
"The main factors reducing net debt were free cash flow (before dividend payments and spectrum
investment) of EUR 20.9 billion and cash proceeds of EUR 10.7 billion from the sale of GD Towers."
Exchange rate effects of EUR 3.6 billion also had a positive impact.
"Net debt increased in particular due to the share buy-back programs at T‑Mobile US
(EUR 12.1 billion)."
"Additions of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets (EUR 4.2 billion), the
dividend payment – including to non-controlling interests – (EUR 4.0 billion), and the sale-and-
leaseback transaction in connection with the sale of GD Towers (EUR 3.0 billion) also had an
increasing effect."
Cash capex (before spectrum investment) decreased by EUR 4.4 billion to EUR 16.6 billion.
"In the United States segment, cash capex decreased by EUR 4.3 billion as a result of higher cash
outflows in the prior year for the accelerated build-out of the 5G network and the integration of
Sprint."
"By contrast, in the Germany segment, our capital expenditures for the fiber-optic and 5G
build-out were slightly higher than in the prior year."
"Cash capex (including spectrum investment), too, decreased by EUR 6.2 billion to EUR 17.9 billion."
"In the reporting year, the United States and Europe segments paid a total amount of EUR 1.3 billion
to acquire spectrum licenses."
"In the prior year, EUR 3.1 billion had been paid for spectrum licenses,
mainly in the United States and Europe segments."
"Free cash flow AL (before dividend payments and spectrum investment) increased from
EUR 11.5 billion to EUR 16.1 billion."
"The sound business performance in the operating segments had an increasing effect on net cash
from operating activities."
"Lower cash outflows in connection with the integration of Sprint in the
United States and lower cash capex (before spectrum investment) also had a positive impact."
"Free cash flow AL was reduced by an increase of EUR 1.0 billion in cash outflows for the repayment
of lease liabilities, mainly in the United States and Germany segments, an increase of
EUR 0.4 billion in tax payments, and an increase of EUR 0.1 billion in net interest payments."

"Network build-out
Germany."
We continued to build out our network infrastructure in Germany throughout the reporting year.
"At the end of 2023,
our 5G network covered 95.9 % of the population, with over 80,000 antennas transmitting 5G across Germany."
"Around 10,000
of these antennas use the fast 5G spectrum in the 3.6 GHz band."
Our rigorous focus on 5G will continue in 2024.
"In the year
ahead, 5G standalone will also be made available for use by consumers."
"Our business customers already use this technology
with functions like network slicing, e.g., for live TV broadcasts of media, or in 5G campus networks for industry and research."
"In the fixed network build-out, optical fiber continued to take center stage."
"By the end of 2023, we had made more than
2.5 million more fiber-optic lines available in Germany."
"In other words, we achieved our build-out target for the year, bringing
the total number of households and businesses with the option to subscribe to a fiber-optic line to around 8 million."
"In the reporting year, Deutsche Telekom established its own civil engineering company to ensure further acceleration of the
network build-out."
This move serves to address the pressing need for civil engineering capacities on the German market.
"The
civil engineering company Deutsche Telekom Tiefbau GmbH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Telekom Deutschland and will
focus on connecting homes."
"In addition to its own build-out efforts, Deutsche Telekom also relies on partnerships as an important mainstay of the build-
out."
"We have a total of around 40 partnerships in place on the joint construction, operation, or use of fiber-optic infrastructure."
"Furthermore, June 2023 marked the start of the implementation phase of the Saxon State Ministry of
Education and Cultural Affairs’ broadband access initiative to connect schools across Saxony to our fiber-optic network."

band in exchange for total cash consideration of between USD 1.2 billion and USD 3.3 billion."

closed in the first half of 2028."
"In the countries of our Europe segment, too, we substantially intensified the network build-out in the reporting year."
"As of the end of 2023, our national companies covered on average 67.2 % of the population in our European footprint with 5G,
representing a significant increase year-on-year."
We also made particularly good progress with the build-out of our fixed network in our European national companies in 2023.
"At the end of the reporting year, a total of around 9.1 million households, which means around 1 million additional households
compared with the prior year, had access to our fiber-optic network offering gigabit speeds."
"We continue to systematically execute on our strategy regarding the shared use of networks, and to this end, our national
companies in Europe also agreed and finalized further cooperations on the fiber-optic build-out in the reporting year."
"Alpen
Glasfaser, a cooperation between Magenta Telekom and Meridiam, started operations in Austria in March 2023."

"The budget was therefore fully
exhausted by the end of September 2023."
T-Mobile US’ shareholder return program from September 2023.
"On September 6, 2023, T‑Mobile US announced a
shareholder return program of up to USD 19 billion that will run from October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024."
"The program
consists of further share buy-backs totaling around USD 15.25 billion, as well as dividends totaling around USD 3.75 billion to

USD 2.2 billion (EUR 2.0 billion) under its share buy-back program."
"Group strategy
Leading Digital Telco – our vision
Since 2021, our Group strategy has been determined by our vision of becoming the Leading Digital Telco by 2030."
"Because few
if any industries face change on the same scale as the telecommunications industry."
"We are seeing companies from other industries pushing onto the market with lean, software-
defined production models."
"Providers such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon Web Services are expanding into the global
connectivity field and increasingly providing network functions in their cloud environments."
"CPaaS (communications platform
as a service) companies offer user-friendly communications services on their own communications platforms – without having
their own networks."
"They provide developers and business customers with standard telecommunications services (calls, text
messages) and new network functions through standardized application programming interfaces (APIs)."
"This shifts access to
end customers in the B2B segment from telecommunications providers to the CPaaS companies."
"We at Deutsche Telekom take up digitalization as the primary driver of significant changes in our ecosystem and
correspondingly also in our strategic alignment."
"For us, this means continuing to invest non-stop in our networks and making
digital participation possible for all."
"Because building and operating convergent networks, in which fixed-network and mobile
services interact perfectly, remains the core of our strategy."
But it also means continuing to digitalize.
"Whether it involves our
products and services, market approach, production, or processes, we ourselves must also become more digital."
"Accordingly,
we want to evolve from a traditional telecommunications provider into a software company that sells telecommunications
services."
"Only if we are digitalized in all areas, can the success of the last few years continue."
"The result will be a
Deutsche Telekom that can adapt faster and more flexibly to changing market conditions."
"In the Western tech-sphere, we are already well positioned to reach our goals on our journey to realizing our Leading Digital
Telco vision: our key performance indicators at the end of the 2023 financial year confirm that Deutsche Telekom remains
Europe’s leading telecommunications company."
"No other telecommunications company has a comparable footprint with its
own networks in Europe and the United States."
"We see ourselves as a global enterprise with a considerable presence in
Europe, European roots and values, and an extremely strong business in the United States."
"However, our Group strategy does
not aim to micromanage all local units, but to provide a strategic framework and to utilize local strengths such as networks
and competitive standing."
"Our T‑Mobile US business in the United States in particular has operated under this decentralized
approach for many years enjoying considerable success with its Un-carrier initiatives."
"Because our Group-wide strategic goals
are clear: we want to align ourselves long-term with the needs of our customers and transform ourselves into a digital company,
harnessing the synergies within our Group, to hold our own against new competitors and continue our growth course."
Our growth ambitions and success metrics measured using key performance indicators remain unchanged.
"The success of
our strategy can be seen in our long-term competitiveness and as such is reflected in the established key financial figures:
at our last 2021 Capital Markets Day, we set an annual growth target (Group CAGR) of 1 to 2 % for revenue and 3 to 5 % for
adjusted EBITDA AL until 2024."
Our next Capital Markets Day is scheduled for 2024.
"For further information on our financial ambition levels through 2024, please refer to the section “Finance strategy.”

"The two
supporting areas of operation, “Save for growth investments” and “Simplify, digitalize, accelerate & act responsibly,” provide
the guidelines for our actions and activities."
"Strategic areas of operation
Lead in digital life & work: Best convergent networks+ & perfect service
Our aspiration is to offer customers the best network experience, anytime, anyplace – whether at home or at work, our
network should work seamlessly and across all technologies."
"That’s why we market fixed-network and mobile communications
in convergent products (fixed-mobile convergence (FMC))."
"Successfully so: at the end of the reporting year, the number of
customers subscribing to FMC or comparable offerings in our Germany and Europe operating segments had increased to
13.8 million."
"To continue on this path of growth, we work continuously to improve our convergent portfolio and make our
customer offerings more attractive."
"Take, for example, the Telekom loyalty bonus program in 2023, which aimed to win over our
existing fixed-network customers also as mobile customers."
"For this reason, we offer our customers additional services that turn our network
leadership aspiration into a first-hand experience."
We reached further milestones in this regard in the reporting year.
"Our
MagentaTV product has been expanded throughout our entire European footprint to aggregate linear television with extensive
features on the one hand, and provide access to content from the biggest video-on-demand providers on the other."
"In 2023,
we continued our efforts to further enhance the TV experience: for instance, in Germany, we will broadcast every match of
the UEFA EURO 2024 soccer championships, including pre- and post-match coverage."
"We also initiated measures to benefit
from the abolition of the “Nebenkostenprivileg” in Germany."
"This meant housing companies were previously able to pass on
cable TV and internet service fees as ancillary rental costs to tenants."
"The change in the law allows tenants to conclude their
own contracts with TV providers as of July 1, 2024."
"We are addressing this new customer group, to which we previously had no
direct access, with attractive offers to switch to MagentaTV."
"Our national companies in Europe further rolled out the Android-
based TV platform with a Deutsche Telekom-specific user interface to deliver an even more personalized user experience
(2023: Croatia and Montenegro)."
"The addition of 205 thousand TV customers in Germany and around 152 thousand in our
national companies in Europe shows that we are on the right track."

Perfect customer service, supported by digitalization, continues to be another powerful lever to help set us apart from the
competition."
"That is why we offer our customers a huge array of service tools, such as a digital home service (phone or on-site
advice on all home network issues), our digital assistant, our callback service, or switching advice."
"In addition, we place great
importance on finding a quick solution to our customers’ issues."
"In 2023, we increased our first-call resolution rate again, i.e.,
the customer issues we resolve directly at the first point of contact (69.0 %; 2022: 56.1 %)."
"In addition, we further developed the
OneApp platform for a digital sales and service experience in our European national companies and in Germany."
Our ratings validate our efforts in this regard.
"For instance, in the Connect service tests our overall score is “very good” for our hotline and “outstanding” for our service app
in Germany and Austria, (issue 10/2023)."
"We are also the best-in-class provider as rated by Chip magazine in its mobile, DSL
and fixed network, TV streaming, and hosting tests."
"Focus Money magazine awarded our Shops the Service King award for the
seventh consecutive time in its Deutschland Test Study 2023."
"In the United States, too, we are reaping the rewards of our focus
on customer-centricity: numerous surveys rank T‑Mobile US ahead of its competitors for service quality (e.g., the J.D."
"Power
study “Wireless Customer Care Mobile Network Operator Performance” rated T‑Mobile US the mobile carrier with the best
customer service in the United States for the 12th time in succession)."
We measure customer satisfaction using the globally recognized TRI*M method.
"We use the results of this non-financial
performance indicator to improve our customer contact processes, and our products and services."
"At the same time, we
determine the loyalty of our customers towards Deutsche Telekom."
"The results are presented as a performance indicator, the
TRI*M index, which ranges between minus 66 and plus 134 points."
"At the end of the reporting year, this indicator (excluding
T‑Mobile US) came in at 76.2 points versus an adjusted value of 75.0 points at the start of the year (both determined on a
comparable basis)."
"The values achieved in particular for our Germany and Systems Solutions operating segments, as well as
across most of the Europe operating segment, put us in a leading position relative to the respective benchmarks."
"With the
exception of the Europe operating segment, where our goal is to post slight improvements in some areas, we plan to maintain
these positions for 2024."
"In 2021, we added the Net Promoter Score (NPS) as a further metric."
"NPS measures the ratio of
enthusiastic customers (promoters) to unhappy customers (detractors)."
"For example, a score of 10 means that the share of
promoters exceeds the share of detractors by 10 percentage points."
"We improved our NPS in all of our operating segments with
consumer operations (Germany, United States, Europe) over the course of the reporting year."
"For example, our NPS in Germany
was up by 4 points."
"In the United States, we not only defended our top NPS score but even improved it further against the prior
year."
"This success is largely down to the various measures we have been pushing in recent months, like topping up data volume
at the beginning of June 2023 for existing postpaid customers who use our Young rate plans in Germany."
"As
a trusted partner, we drive forward the digitalization of our customers based on global, secure connectivity, flexible software-
based networks, and end-to-end security solutions."
"And in future, these activities will increasingly be based on integrated
offerings (combining fixed network, mobile communications, and IT) and further strengthen our portfolio in the IT environment."
"The MagentaBusiness Collaboration product family, for example, already combines flexible communications solutions and
tools for collaborative work in a seamless overall solution."
"In 2022, we introduced, among other products, the Microsoft
Teams | X solution, which we further expanded in 2023: the mobile add-on for Microsoft Teams enables customers to integrate
their existing mobile phone number in Microsoft Teams for even smoother collaboration."
"However, integrated offerings also
require digitalization expertise beyond connectivity (e.g., presales, integration), since small and medium-sized enterprises in
particular are increasingly looking for solutions from a single source."
"In the reporting year, we continued to post organic growth
in IT revenue from business customers in our Germany operating segment."
"Our national companies in Europe also recorded
substantial growth in revenue with business customers across all areas (mobile, fixed network, IT)."
"Growth was strongest in the
Europe operating segment, where our IT solutions business posted a revenue increase of 6.7 %."
"Demand for our productivity,
cloud, and security solution portfolio continued to grow in 2023."
"We already entered into a strategic
partnership with the software company Teridion in 2022, which enables us to offer our business customers improved secure
connectivity to network their locations across the globe."
"The partnership and related investment in Teridion by
Deutsche Telekom underlines how important the issue of software-based networks is for us."
"In the medium term, we want to
respond to changing customer needs with fully cloud-based, modular network services and dynamically adapt our networks."
APIs will even make it possible in future to automatically manage individual network parameters in real time.
"To this end, over
the coming years we plan to radically overhaul our own network and IT landscape, transforming it into a modular, software-
defined production environment with integration capabilities for customized app and IT landscapes."
"We made the first network
APIs commercially available in the reporting year: under the brand Magenta Business API, we offer developers and business
customers easy access to communication APIs and new network APIs."

As major topics like the Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity become more relevant, security and network solutions
(network, IT, and cloud computing) are beginning to merge into highly secure, end-to-end solutions."
"We will continue to develop the
core elements of our B2B portfolio, comprising our Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) solutions and SD-WAN products,
holistically, taking account of network and security aspects."
"“Security by Design” is our goal here – from development and operation to management of the network services
by us and our customers."
"Since 2022, we have bundled Deutsche Telekom Security and the security business in Germany,
Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, and Slovakia under the Germany operating segment to bring security and network solutions
closer together from an organizational perspective."
"IT business for corporate customers is moving away from traditional IT outsourcing services towards new cloud-based services
and digital solutions."
"The vision of our Systems Solutions operating segment is to become the “leading European vertical
full-service IT player.” The vision concentrates in particular on the DACH region, where we are already a leading IT service
provider (in terms of revenue)."
"Our strategic focus is on fulfilling the core customer requirements of digitalization: advisory,
cloud services, and digital solutions."
"For selected industries (automotive, healthcare, public sector, and public transport), we
additionally offer industry-specific solutions."
"We are increasingly making use of AI, too, to help improve customer solutions and
internal processes."
"We already handed greater autonomy and entrepreneurial responsibility to our portfolio units in 2022, with
the goal of scaling the respective business significantly faster and accelerating growth."
"We rely increasingly on partnerships to
support us in this regard and are also expanding nearshoring and offshoring capacities."
"We call the
edge we can achieve through these assets and capabilities Magenta Advantage."
"We want to use this advantage in a targeted
way to develop new, digital business models to complement our core business."
"For example, we would like to further leverage
our digital reach and brand strength advantage in a more targeted manner to make exclusive offers from partners available to
our customers, to reward their loyalty and – where possible – to generate additional revenue."
"In 2023, we began to reap the
first rewards of our loyalty program Magenta Moments, which has its own section in the MeinMagenta/OneApp in Germany
and our national companies in Europe."
"Since the start of 2023, we have delighted more than 4.7 million customers in Germany
(since its launch even more than 5.3 million customers) with exclusive offerings from partners such as booking.com, Rituals,
Netflix, Disney+, and Octopus Energy."
"Overall in 2023, we enabled more than 170 moments for our customers with external
partnerships, Telekom Highlights, competitions, and priority tickets for music events."
"Roll-out in our national companies began
in the third quarter of 2023, and the program is now running in five countries."
"We have since won around 2 million users in
these regions and enabled over 1 million transactions."
"Our network of active partnerships already extends to over 500 national
and international brands such as Booking, Flixbus, and Wolt."
"The approach is paying off: customer satisfaction, measured using
NPS, is higher among Magenta Moments users than among non-users."
"In the future, we plan to build up further capabilities
for data analysis and segmentation and continuously improve the personalization of our offers."
"The core of our brand promise,
“Reliability, security, and trust,” remains the same and protecting our customers’ data and privacy is our top priority."
"On top of
this, we also use our Magenta Advantage to invest locally in digital business models."
"Examples of these are the online delivery
service Box and the payment service Payzy in Greece."
"Build and scale telco as a platform
Our growth areas are based on our networks and our technology, which together form the core of our value creation."
"That
is why we are systematically building out and interlinking our fixed and mobile networks because our strategic goal is to
offer our customers the fastest possible connection at top quality, anytime, anyplace."
"Group-wide, in 2023, we invested more
than EUR 16 billion (not including spectrum investment) primarily in building and operating networks, with EUR 5.7 billion
of this figure spent in Germany alone."
This makes us the biggest single investor among all of our German competitors.
"In
pursuit of outstanding quality and an even quicker and more efficient network build-out, we are also striking out in new
directions, for example, with the use of AI to ensure infrastructure is built out in line with demand and to increase automation
in infrastructure planning and construction."
"Integrated management improves the capacity utilization of our infrastructure and
increases efficiency in operations and maintenance."

Fiber optic-based fixed networks are the basis for integrated network experiences."
"As a consequence, we are working flat out
to build out our fixed-network infrastructure with state-of-the-art optical fiber."
"In the reporting year, we invested more than
EUR 2.5 billion in building out our fiber-optic infrastructure in Germany – significantly more than any other competitor."
"We
increased the number of broadband customers in the Europe operating segment by 4.6 % compared with the end of 2022
to 7.0 million."
"A total of 9.1 million households (coverage of around 35 %) in the footprint of our European national companies
have access to our high-performance fiber-optic network."
"In Germany, we made fiber-optic lines (FTTH) available to more than
2.5 million more households and companies by the end of 2023."
"In 2024, we want to maintain the same high build-out pace
and give around 2.5 million new households access to fiber."
"This will put us on target to meet our own goal of making more than
10 million fiber-optic lines available by the end of 2024."
"By 2030, every household and every business in Germany is to have a
fiber-optic line."
Our aspiration is for Telekom Deutschland to build the majority of these.
"To this end, we are expanding our team
and hired more than 2,000 additional fiber-optic experts and technicians in the reporting year."
"We also established our own civil
engineering company in 2023 (Deutsche Telekom Tiefbau GmbH) to address the pressing need for civil engineering capacities
on the market."
The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Telekom Deutschland and will focus on connecting homes.
"It is set
to hire around 230 employees through the end of 2024."
"But urban centers
are not the only ones to benefit from the network build-out: we also plan to cover a total of 8 million households in rural areas
with optical fiber by 2030."
"The fiber-optic build-out companies GlasfaserPlus and Glasfaser NordWest are set to add a further
5 million households overall to this target."
"We also rely on cooperations in our national companies in
Europe to help drive forward the fiber-optic build-out (e.g., Alpen Glasfaser in Austria, Vectra in Poland)."
"But our competitors
also need to play their part."
Deutsche Telekom is building out the network on the basis of open access.
"The new networks are
open for use by competitors."
The positive response shows that our efforts are paying off.
"We received further awards in 2023: Deutsche Telekom has
been voted #1 by Connect readers in Germany (04/2023) in several categories including best Fixed Network Operator."
"Funke Mediengruppe’s consumer magazine Imtest (09/2023 issue) rates Deutsche Telekom “very good” in its broadband and
fixed network test in Germany."
"The trade magazine Connect rates Deutsche Telekom best-in-class for its fixed network in
Germany (07/2023 issue) and Austria (08/2023 issue)."
"Magenta in Austria is ranked best overall B2B internet provider in the
ÖGVS consumer study."
"And our Austrian network wins fastest fixed-network internet in Austria in the 2023 Ookla® Speedtest
Award."
"In mobile communications, we set ourselves apart from our competitors with the multi-network-test-winning quality of our
network."
"With 5G, we are creating a highly reliable mobile network with extremely low latency and high data throughput."
"Over 80,000 antennas now transmit 5G across Germany."
"As of the end of 2023, over 10,000 of these antennas in more than
800 towns, cities, and communities were using the fast 5G spectrum in the 3.6 GHz band."
"By the end of 2023, 95.9 % of the
population of Germany was already covered by our 5G network."
"By the end of 2025, 5G is set to cover 90 % of Germany,
reaching 99 % of the population."
We additionally want to offer 5G standalone for consumers in 2024.
"Deutsche Telekom’s
business customers already use this technology with functions like network slicing, e.g., for live TV broadcasts or in 5G campus
networks for industry and research."
"As of the end of 2023, our national companies covered on average 67.2 % of the population
in our European footprint with 5G."
T‑Mobile US’ 5G network covered around 98 % of the U.S.
"population at the end of the
reporting year, with over 300 million people benefiting from Ultra Capacity 5G."
"We regularly top the independent network tests: Connect readers (2023) rate Deutsche Telekom best in the categories Mobile
Network Operator and Network Operator Prepaid Cards, while our secondary brand congstar wins the category Mobile
Communications Provider."
"T‑Mobile US’ mobile network has once again been awarded best-in-class with regards to speed in
the Ookla® Speedtest Global Index and the Umlaut Audit Report (07/2023)."
"Our national companies in Greece, Croatia, the
Czech Republic, and Austria, too, receive Ookla and Umlaut awards for both the fastest and best mobile networks."
Our strategic goal is to be able to use the best-in-class integrated network infrastructure for our products and services.
"That
is why we are complementing our own infrastructure with that of strategic partners, while also considering alternative access
networks (e.g., satellites or high-altitude platform systems, HAPS)."
"T‑Mobile US and SpaceX already announced joint plans
in 2022 that will enable our U.S."
"subsidiary to bring cell phone connectivity to its customers in parts of the United States
previously without cell tower coverage using SpaceX’s Starlink satellites."
"With this technology, T‑Mobile US is planning to
provide coverage for text messages and participating messaging apps, practically everywhere in the United States, Puerto Rico,
and territorial waters."
The next step for the two companies will be to drive forward the build-out of voice and data coverage.
"In
the future, satellite communication will be used to enhance classic terrestrial IoT networks (NB-IoT, LTE-M, 4G, and 5G), an area
that Deutsche Telekom IoT is working on in collaboration with specialists Intelsat and Skylo."

The delivery of connectivity and services based on our own and our partners’ infrastructure is reliant on technology- and
domain-agnostic orchestration capabilities."
"These are found in a separate technical control layer above the actual
infrastructure, which allows us to manage the “network of networks.” We are modernizing our NT/IT architecture to ensure
the necessary orchestration capabilities are in place."
"Our focus is on leveraging the full potential of network automation,
cloudification, and disaggregation to make our production considerably faster, more flexible, and more cost-efficient."
"Disaggregation, or the separation of hardware and software, makes it possible to add new suppliers."
"We made significant
progress in respect of the Open Radio Access Network in the reporting year."
"One big change is that components from
various different technology suppliers are now interoperable, and the first such antenna system has been transmitting in
the commercial network since December 2023, providing coverage to areas of New Brandenburg."
"Nokia and Fujitsu supply
the necessary technology components."
"Today, around 80 to 90 % of all suppliers in our infrastructure are large, traditional
companies."
"Going forward, we want to take into consideration even more smaller, innovative suppliers, enabling us to integrate
innovations into our networks more quickly and flexibly and thus also making them available to our customers."
"We are adapting our production platform to meet the customer needs of the future, by building cloud-based, scalable,
modular platforms and opening up access to selected parts of these platforms to third parties (e.g., service providers and
app developers) via open interfaces (APIs)."
"Our goal is to make connectivity, services, and data (e.g., location data, connection
conditions, and user behavior) combinable with new applications as needed."
"Supporting areas of operation
Save for growth investments
Future growth requires adequate investment."
"To this end, we are investing in our own innovativeness as well as integrating
successful new developments from outside our Company."
"Thanks to our cost discipline, we generate the funds we need to
finance this investment and safeguard our competitiveness."
"For us, the goal of becoming Leading Digital Telco also means
being the leading telecommunications provider in terms of efficiency."
"At Group Headquarters & Group Services, for instance,
we have raised our efficiency ambitions and introduced further steps to reduce costs in the coming years."
"But above all it is
digitalization that is key to further enhancing cost efficiency throughout our entire value chain: from the customer interface,
to our production processes, through to the management of our own infrastructure and supply chains."
"We will therefore
systematically continue on this path of cost transformation."
We manage our investment portfolio with the aim of enhancing value.
"We believe that this means realizing value when the
conditions are attractive."
"We completed the sale of GD Towers on February 1, 2023 and used the funds from the sale as planned
to increase our stake in T‑Mobile US, as well as for other measures."
"On April 5, 2023, in the course of the 2022 share buy-
back program, our ownership stake in T‑Mobile US reached 50.2 %, thus passing the threshold for a majority stake."
"Taking the
treasury shares held by T‑Mobile US into account, our ownership stake in T‑Mobile US was 50.6 % as of December 31, 2023."
"In
early 2024, Deutsche Telekom began selling a portion of its T‑Mobile US share portfolio on the market, without jeopardizing its
own majority ownership position in T‑Mobile US."
"Simplify, digitalize, accelerate & act responsibly
Simplicity in our offers and in our organization makes the digital transformation of our core business easier."
"In this way, we
increase our implementation speed – both in the interaction with customers and in the implementation of new, strategic
initiatives."
"This is why we want to become simpler, more digital, and ultimately more agile."
There are two main thrusts to our pursuit of simplicity.
"First, we want to offer our customers simple rate plans, like MagentaTV
MegaStream, and intuitive products."
"To this end, we continually work to make improvements, such as to our TV voice control,
which we are set to roll out to further markets outside of Germany."
"Going forward, we want to significantly further reduce
product complexity."
Our ambition is for our services to be available around the clock via a single click.
"Thanks to an IP migration
which has been successfully concluded, we can now remotely perform setup and maintenance work to the line in increasingly
more households – depending on the router."
"The technical provisioning of 95 out of 100 broadband lines is already successful
on the first attempt."
"Second, we want our internal operation to be as efficient as possible, i.e., in terms of time and costs."
"We
are making promising progress with the introduction of greater agility into our IT activities."
"For example, since 2020 we have
increased the development speed for new software or software-driven products in Germany and Europe by around 40 %."
"Today,
our average time to release for purely software-based adaptations is around 2.0 months in Germany (e.g., personal customer
dialog for consumers, digital order management for business customers) and around 1.0 months in Europe."
"At the 2021 Capital
Markets Day, we set ourselves the goal of reducing time to release to 1 month in Europe and 2 months in Germany by 2024."
We had almost achieved this goal by the end of 2023.
"Above and beyond this, we will continue to scrutinize our organization,
processes, and decision-making procedures and further optimize them in future, wherever possible."

The digitalization of our core business is helping us to improve customer experience and increase our efficiency."
"Our sales
and service apps are now firmly established in Germany and Europe as key digital customer interfaces."
"They help us monetize
our product portfolio through up- and cross-selling, and bring down costs by reducing service cases through self-service and
preventive maintenance."
"In our European national companies, around 71 % of customers use our service app."
"In Germany,
the figure stands at 52 % following migration to the OneApp platform (2022: 42 %)."
"In connection with the migration, the
collection of app-specific metrics (e.g., app penetration) was harmonized in Germany to ensure Europe-wide comparability
within the Group."
"Beyond this, we encourage the use of our digital assistant, which is integrated into our OneApp, for advice
and measure the number of interactions."
Our German digital assistant is called Frag Magenta (ask magenta).
"Artificial
intelligence (AI) enables it to learn automatically and improve its competence at responding to customer inquiries."
"Our
customers in Germany can now express requests using natural language, i.e., their own words, to communicate with the
Frag Magenta chatbot."
"Since early December 2023, customers can also chat with our video avatar, Max, to find the answers
they need."
This innovative step puts us at the forefront in terms of customer service in Europe.
"Another factor that plays
into an outstanding and, above all, personalized experience is a 360° view of our customers across all channels, both online
and offline."
"Magenta View is our front-end platform for all employees with direct customer contact, delivering all necessary
customer data from a single source."
"At the end of the reporting year, around 50,000 employees in Germany were benefiting
from Magenta View."
"Long term, our plan is to digitalize virtually all value creation stages in their entirety."
"To this end, we
are systematically expanding our expertise in innovative technologies like AI."
"Data-based analyses are already helping us to
maintain our hardware more proactively, understand customer needs better, and manage our networks more efficiently."
"However, simplicity and digitalization also call for new skills and a cultural change."
"In 2023, we focused our learning offerings,
the Explorer Journeys, specifically to future issues."
"With these programs, we want to prepare as many employees as possible
for the skills that will be required in the future."
A key focus in this regard was on teaching people more about AI.
"We also
continued to offer Journeys on software development, data analytics, digital marketing, user experience, and other topics."
"Since introducing the Explorer Journeys globally in 2021, around 21,000 employees have taken part in the range of courses."
"With a digital learning rate of around 73 % (share of learning hours over digital media), digital learning is firmly established
as a learning tool at Deutsche Telekom."
"Since 2021, we have also been enabling our employees to increase their participation in the Company’s success
through the share program Shares2You."
"In the reporting year, 38,637 employees took advantage of the program."
"That our
efforts are paying off is validated by our employee satisfaction levels: the question on Mood/Satisfaction remains at a very high
level of 78 % (2022: 81 %)."
"For further information about our People Strategy, please refer to the section “Employees.”
In parallel, we fulfill our responsibility to society by systematically aligning our core business processes with the principle of
sustainability."
"We revised and further refined our sustainability strategy in 2022: climate protection, circular economy, diversity
and team performance, as well as digital responsibility and participation are our four key action areas."
"In addition to our goal
of climate neutrality along our entire value chain at the latest by 2040, we added another interim goal and ambition level
in 2023: we want to cut emissions along our value chain by 55 % by 2030, and by as much as 90 % by 2040."
"Our climate
goal complies with SBTi requirements."
"In addition, we want to be 100 % circular by 2030 in terms of terminal equipment and
network technology."
"We have taken back over 4.9 million devices in Germany and Europe either to refurbish or to send them
directly for recycling, so that we and our customers actively help conserve resources and protect the climate."
"We are also
tackling the issues of climate protection and circular economy with our suppliers, e.g., in tender conditions."
"In 2023, we pressed
ahead with the implementation of the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz
– LkSG)."
"We introduced a sustainability standard for our packaging back in 2020, removing single-use plastics in favor of
recyclable materials and environmentally friendly colorings."
"All new Telekom-branded (or T-branded) devices and more than
two thirds of the new packaging for smartphones that we source from our suppliers meet these criteria."
"Since 2021, 100 % of
our electricity requirements for all Group units have been met from renewable sources."
"We plan to become twice as energy
efficient by 2024, based on the data volume in the network in relation to the power consumed in this context."
"To help us achieve
this goal, we are decommissioning legacy platforms – including PSTN, migrating to more efficient technology – such as the
switch from 3G to 5G, using highly efficient data centers, and deploying AI."
"From a long-term perspective, we will also achieve
savings from the migration from copper to fiber-optic technology."
"These measures will enable us to maintain stable power
consumption in Germany and Europe through 2024, despite rapidly rising data volumes, growing numbers of active network
components, and the further densification of our networks."
"Above and beyond this, we are supporting
a responsible approach to digitalization."
"Under the motto “No hate speech,” Deutsche Telekom is supporting, for example,
projects for media literacy in society and against cyberbullying."
"We also take our social responsibility seriously when it comes
to natural disasters, whether with free phone calls and data traffic after the earthquakes in Turkey, Syria, and Morocco, for
example, or emergency aid after the forest fires and hurricanes in the United States."
"For further information on our sustainability strategy, please refer to the section “Combined non-financial statement.”

Our strategy is summarized in the following ambitions:
Finance strategy
We announced our finance strategy for the years 2021 through 2024 at the Capital Markets Day in May 2021."
"For investors,
Deutsche Telekom continues to pursue an attractive and reliable finance strategy."
"We will present our plans for the coming
years at the Capital Markets Day scheduled for 2024."
b Deviation from the target range for a short period as a result of the business combination of T‑Mobile US and Sprint until year-end 2024.
"Part of our finance strategy is to achieve our target financial ratios – relative debt (ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA) and
equity ratio – along with a liquidity reserve that covers our maturities of the coming 24 months at least."
"With these clear
statements we intend to maintain our rating in a corridor from A- to BBB and safeguard undisputed access to the capital market."
"There is a sustainable dividend policy for shareholders, which is subject to approval by the relevant bodies and the fulfillment
of other legal requirements."
"Starting from the 2021 financial year, the amount of the dividend is based on a dividend payout
ratio of 40 to 60 % of adjusted earnings per share, with a lower limit fixed at EUR 0.60 per dividend-bearing share."
"For the
2023 financial year, as announced in November 2023, we propose a dividend of EUR 0.77 for each dividend-bearing share."
"This
equates to 48 % of adjusted earnings per share."
We thus offer our shareholders both an attractive return and planning reliability.
As in previous years the dividend for the 2023 financial year will once again be paid out without deduction of capital gains tax.
"At the 2021 Capital Markets Day, Deutsche Telekom AG’s Board of Management had also announced that it would take
share buy-backs into consideration in the future."
"In November 2023, we announced that we will buy back shares in
Deutsche Telekom AG in 2024 up to a total purchase price of EUR 2 billion under a share buy-back program."
"The buy-back
commenced on January 3, 2024 and will be carried out in several tranches through December 31, 2024."
"The purpose of the
share buy-back is to recoup part of the dilution effect from Deutsche Telekom AG’s 2021 capital increase."
"The repurchased
shares will therefore be canceled."
"We want to be a leader in terms of digital living and working, and in the implementation of advances in productivity for our
business customers."
Because only when we lead can we grow and meet the demands of our investors in the long term.
"We want to better utilize our existing assets and skills not only in our core business, but also to develop new, digital business
models (Magenta Advantage)."
"The key technical driver for our growth areas is telco as a platform: the best integrated network infrastructure – provided by
us and by partners – as well as cloud-based customer and network-service platforms."
"The basis for this is and remains our
ongoing commitment to building out the fiber-optic and 5G networks."
"We promote continued growth by carefully managing our financial resources and systematically transforming the Company
to be simple, digital, and agile in every sense."
We play a responsible and active role in society.
"We are a partner, not just at a societal level, but also at a political one,
and we work in the interests of ensuring the open, forward-looking development of all countries in which we are active."

Total capital expenditure is also to remain high in the next few years, in line with our finance strategy."
"The scope for investment
is to be used to further roll out our broadband infrastructure and to accelerate the transformation of the Company."
"In mobile
communications, the infrastructure build-out will focus on the LTE and 5G standards and, in the fixed network, mainly on our
accelerated fiber-optic build-out."
The finance strategy supports the transformation of our Group into the Leading Digital Telco.
"In order to generate a sustainable increase in value, we intend to earn at least our cost of capital."
"We plan to meet this target by
optimizing the utilization of our non-current assets on the one hand, and pursuing strict cost discipline and profitable revenue
growth on a sustainable basis, on the other."
"dollar exchange rate at the time of USD 1.14 as well as a constant
composition of the Group."
b Before dividend payments and spectrum investment.
c Compound annual growth rate.
We expect revenue to increase by an average of 1 to 2 % per year and adjusted EBITDA AL by an average of 3 to 5 %.
"Based on
the results generated in the period from 2021 to 2023, as well as our forecast for 2024, we believe we are on the right path to
achieve these targets."
We aim to continue growing sustainably throughout 2024.
"For further information on the expected business development, please refer to the section “Forecast.”
In order to set and achieve our strategic goals more effectively, we pursue a Group-wide, value-oriented performance
management approach, which we explain in the following section."
"Management of the Group
We are committed to the concept of value-oriented corporate governance."
"We want to strike a balance between the
contrasting expectations of our stakeholders so that sufficient funding is available for an attractive dividend, deleveraging,
responsible staff restructuring, and new investment in a positive and sustainable customer experience."
"Performance management system
We use a specific set of performance indicators to reliably and transparently measure success."
"The following tables and
information provide an overview of our key financial and non-financial performance indicators."
"Shareholders expect an appropriate, reliable return on their capital employed."
Providers of debt capital expect an appropriate return and that Deutsche Telekom is able to repay its debts.
"Employees expect jobs that are secure, prospects for the future, and that any necessary staff restructuring will be done in a
responsible manner."
"“Entrepreneurs within the enterprise” expect sufficient investment funding to be able to shape Deutsche Telekom’s future
business and develop products, innovations, and services for the customer."
"Society expects us to do everything within our power to protect the environment, encourage a fair and democratic co-
existence, and shape the digital transformation in a responsible manner."

Broader definition of service revenue.
"Since January 1, 2023, service revenue additionally includes certain software revenues
generated with ICT business in the Systems Solutions and Europe operating segments, as well as in the Group Headquarters & Group
Services segment."
Comparative figures for the prior years were adjusted retrospectively up to and including 2021.
"PresentationofGD Towersaccordingtothemanagementapproach.ThesaleoftheGD Towersbusinessentitywasconsummatedon
February 1, 2023, and GD Towers has not been part of the Group since that date."
"The GD Towers business entity had been recognized
in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation from the third quarter of 2022 until its sale."
"By contrast, we
use the management approach for the presentation in the combined management report, i.e., the financial performance indicators
presented in the results of operations still include the value contributions from GD Towers up to and including January 2023."
"45
The gain on deconsolidation resulting from the sale of GD Towers amounted to EUR 12.9 billion and is included in EBITDA and
the associated performance indicators."
"In the consolidated income statement, the amount is recognized under profit/loss from
discontinued operation as other operating income."
"For further information on the sale of GD Towers, please refer to the section “Group organization.”
Revenue and earnings
Revenue corresponds to the value of our operating activities."
"Absolute revenue depends on how well we are able to sell our
products and services on the market."
"The development of our revenue is an essential indicator for measuring the Company’s
success."
New products and services as well as additional sales activities are only successful if they increase revenue.
"Service
revenue essentially comprises high-value – i.e., predictable and/or recurring – revenues from Deutsche Telekom’s core
activities."
"Service revenue is the revenues that are generated by services (i.e., revenue from fixed and mobile network voice
calls – incoming and outgoing calls – as well as data services) plus roaming revenue, monthly basic charges and visitor
revenue, as well as revenue generated from the ICT business."
"Service revenue also includes revenues earned in connection with
premium services for customers, such as reinsurance for device insurance policies and extended warranties."
"Service revenue is
an important indicator for the successful implementation of the growth strategy of the Group."
"We measure our operating earnings performance on the basis of adjusted EBITDA AL, i.e., EBITDA adjusted for depreciation
of right-of-use assets, for interest expenses on recognized lease liabilities, and for special factors."
"And EBITDA is calculated
as EBIT (profit/loss from operations) before depreciation, amortization and impairment losses on intangible assets, property,
plant and equipment, and right-of-use assets."
"Both metrics indicate the short-term operational performance and the success of
individual business areas."
"Special factors have an impact on the presentation of operations, making it more difficult to compare
performance indicators with corresponding figures for prior periods."
"For this reason, we adjust our performance indicators to
provide transparency."
"Without this adjustment, statements about the future development of earnings are only possible to a
limited extent."
"The further inclusion of unadjusted EBIT/EBITDA AL as performance indicators means special factors are also
taken into account."
This promotes a holistic view of our expenses.
"In addition to these absolute indicators, we also use the EBIT
and EBITDA AL margins to show how these indicators develop in relation to revenue."
"This makes it possible to compare the
earnings performance of profit-oriented units of different sizes."
"Profitability
We have incorporated sustainable growth in enterprise value into our medium-term aims and implemented it as a separate key
performance indicator (KPI) for the entire Group."
"Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a key performance indicator at Group
level."
"ROCE is the ratio of operating result after depreciation, amortization and impairment losses plus imputed taxes (net
operating profit after taxes, NOPAT) to the average value of the assets tied up in the course of the year (net operating assets,
NOA)."
"Our goal is to achieve or exceed the return targets imposed on us by providers of debt capital and equity on the basis of capital
market requirements."
We measure return targets using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
"NOPAT is an earnings indicator derived from the consolidated income statement, taking an imputed tax expense into
consideration."
It does not include cost of capital.
NOA includes all assets that make a direct contribution to revenue generation.
"These include all elements on the asset side
of the consolidated statement of financial position that are essential to the rendering of services."
"To this is added operating
working capital, calculated from trade receivables, inventories, and trade and other payables."
"The figure for other provisions is
deducted as no return target exists for this."
"Free cash flow AL is a key yardstick
for providers of debt capital and equity."
"It measures the potential for further developing our Company, for generating organic
growth, and for the ability to pay dividends and repay debt."

Cash capex (before spectrum investment) relates to cash outflows for investments in intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
and property, plant and equipment, which are relevant for cash outflows as a component of free cash flow."
"A rating is an assessment or classification of the creditworthiness of debt securities and their issuer according to uniform
criteria."
"The assessment of creditworthiness by ratings agencies affects access to the capital markets and to the international
finance markets, and refinancing costs."
"As part of our finance policy, we have defined a target range for our ratings."
"We believe
that with a rating between A- and BBB (Standard & Poor’s, Fitch) or between A3 and Baa2 (Moody’s) we essentially have the
necessary entry to the capital markets to generate the required financing."

We believe that satisfied customers act as multipliers for our Company’s success.
"As a responsible, service-oriented company,
the needs and opinions of our customers are of great importance to us, and we want them to stay with our Company in the
long term."
"For this reason, we measure customer satisfaction in our companies using the globally recognized TRI*M method."
The results of systematic surveys are expressed by an indicator known as the TRI*M index.
"To underscore the significance of
customer retention/satisfaction for our operating business, the performance of Board of Management members and eligible
managers is now also being tracked and incentivized by means of the long-term variable remuneration (Long-Term Incentive
Plan)."
"This KPI, as one of four target parameters, has been relevant for Variable II since 2010, as well as for the Long-Term
Incentive Plan which was launched in 2015, and in which the Board of Management has participated since 2021."
"We take the
TRI*M indexes calculated for the operating entities (excluding T‑Mobile US) as an approximation of the respective entities’
percentage of total revenue to create an aggregate TRI*M value."
"This allows Board members and eligible managers to benefit
from the development of customer retention/satisfaction."
"For further information on customer satisfaction, please refer to the section “Group strategy.”
Our employees want to contribute to the further development of the Company and identify with it."
"We want to pursue open
dialog and productive exchange with our employees."
"New working models and state-of-the-art communication options, as well
as regular employee surveys, help us to accomplish this."
"The main feedback tools which the Group uses to assess employee
satisfaction are the employee survey, as of late carried out every two years, and the half-yearly pulse survey (both excluding
T‑Mobile US)."
"The employee survey was not carried out in the reporting year on account of a change in service provider, and
has instead been rescheduled for 2024."
"In our Company, we measure the employee satisfaction performance indicator using
the engagement score – derived from the results of the last survey."
"In view of the major significance
of employee satisfaction for the success of the Company, the performance of Board of Management members and eligible
managers is now also being tracked and incentivized by means of the long-term variable remuneration (Long-Term Incentive
Plan)."
"Employee feedback, as one of four target parameters, has been relevant for Variable II since 2010, as well as for the Long-
Term Incentive Plan which was launched in 2015, and in which the Board of Management has participated since 2021."
"This
allows Board of Management members and eligible managers to benefit from the development of employee satisfaction."
"For further information about employee satisfaction, please refer to the section “Employees.”

Climate change and the destruction of the environment are existential threats to the world."
"Companies must therefore
significantly increase their energy and resource efficiency and restrict their absolute energy consumption."
"This issue is ever
more relevant for providers of information and communications technology (ICT)."
"There is a general expectation on the ICT
sector to continue building out the telecommunications network while, at the very least, keeping basic consumption stable
in the medium term or even reducing it going forward."
"Deutsche Telekom records ESG data and performance indicators
(environmental, social, and governance), which are used first and foremost to calculate our Group-wide ESG KPIs, on the basis
of which we measure and manage our CR performance."
"Given the major significance of two ESG targets, the performance of
Board of Management members has also been tracked and incentivized by means of the annual variable remuneration since
2021."
"Since 2022, this has also applied for our managers (excluding T‑Mobile US) and all employees not covered by collective
agreements in Germany."
"The non-financial performance indicator energy consumption is a record of the energy consumed
in connection with the operation of our actual business model."
"We constantly monitor progress regarding our medium-term
goal to reduce energy consumption (by 2024 compared with 2020, excluding T‑Mobile US), and can make adjustments where
necessary."
"To this end, we invest in measures and programs to conserve energy from all sources."
"At the same time, this
goal plays into how we optimize and innovate for our future infrastructure, and calls for the use of innovative technology
components."
"In living up to our responsibility to conserve resources and protect the climate, we also run various initiatives
that aim to reduce the CO2 emissions generated as part of our business activities."
"These initiatives include the sustained use
of 100 % green electricity since 2021, optimizing power consumption in our buildings, and gradually transitioning our Group
fleet vehicles from fossil fuels to zero- or low-emission power sources."
"We started gradually transitioning all company cars
in Germany to these power sources in 2023."
"We measure our progress with reducing our carbon
footprint on the basis of the CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) non-financial performance indicator."
"In the United States, we
are forging ahead with the highly intensive build-out of our 5G network, in particular in rural areas."
"This initially drives up
power consumption."
"T‑Mobile US, like the Group as a whole, has covered 100 % of its electricity requirements from renewable
energy sources since 2021."
"There are fluctuations in T‑Mobile US’ Scope 1 carbon footprint owing to unforeseeable natural
disasters and the associated temporary use of equipment such as diesel generators to restore and back up damaged network
infrastructure."
"Consideration must be given to the special national situation in this key market, which is why the decision
was taken not to include T‑Mobile US in these two non-financial performance indicators in respect of short-term variable
remuneration."
"This step ensures that the right incentives are set for the Board of Management toward the sustainable
development of the business, while at the same time safeguarding the stability of network operations."
"The same applies for
our Board members, executives, and all employees in Germany not covered by collective agreements."
"The annual ambition for
the performance indicators “energy consumption” and “CO2 emissions” will continue to be set, managed, and reported for the
entire Group as before, including a target value for T‑Mobile US."
"Acquiring and
retaining customers is thus essential to the success of our Company."
"In our Systems Solutions operating segment, we use order entry as a non-financial performance indicator."
"We define and
calculate order entry as the total of all amounts resulting from customer orders received in the financial year."
"Order entry in the
form of long-term contracts is of great significance to the Group in order to estimate revenue potential."
"In other words, order
entry is an indicator that provides a high degree of planning reliability."
"Performance indicators at Deutsche Telekom AG
Net income is the financial performance indicator of greatest relevance for Deutsche Telekom AG and is used to pay out the
dividend to shareholders."
"Development of the economic environment and impact on our business activities and key performance indicators
The macroeconomic challenges currently facing society, politics, and business are multi-faceted."
"The global economy
continues to be beset by the challenges of relatively high interest rates and dampened growth prospects."
"Tougher financing
conditions, weak trade growth, and diminished business and consumer confidence are negatively impacting the economic
outlook."
Growing geopolitical tensions are further contributing to increased uncertainty about the economic outlook.
"The impact on Deutsche Telekom’s business activities and performance indicators in the reporting year stems primarily from
higher energy, producer, and consumer prices, construction costs, and interest rates compared with the 2022 financial year."

We are aware that, in view of the current developments, it is only possible to extrapolate past experience to the future to
a limited extent."
"We continue to address these challenges and consider them in our business decisions in the course of
developing measures to mitigate the risks."
"For instance, interest rate risks are countered by reducing the variable-interest debt
portfolio."
"With respect to energy supply, Deutsche Telekom’s national companies pursue different procurement strategies, e.g.,
by concluding power purchase agreements, to balance long-term supply reliability and appropriate prices."
"The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) puts the global growth rate in 2023 at 3.1 %, down from 3.5 % in 2022."
"This slowdown is largely due to the flagging
recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and tighter monetary policy and financial framework
conditions."
"A further adverse factor is the restrained economic development in China caused mainly by debt in the nation’s real
estate sector."
"The tighter monetary policy and declining commodity prices dampened the buoyancy of consumer prices in the
United States and the eurozone in the reporting year."
There were contrasting trends in the economies in our core markets in the reporting year.
"In the United States, the economic
situation developed better than had been anticipated at the start of the year."
"There was a marked increase in both consumer
spending and capital investments, the latter most likely due in part to the recent introduction of subsidies in the semiconductor
industry and in the area of transformation technologies."
"By contrast, the European economy stagnated with a weak outlook."
"The industrial sector in particular suffered from rising
interest rates, weak global demand, and diminished price competitiveness caused by the appreciation of the euro."
"This also
resulted in more companies filing for insolvency in 2023."
"In the construction industry, demand for construction services has
dropped markedly due to significantly worse financing conditions and sharp rises in construction costs."
"Consumer spending
was also a weak point for the economy."
"The magazine “The
Economist” rated Greece the top-performing economy of 2023."
"The IMF also praised the Greek economy’s positive
development, highlighting the country’s progress with the digital transformation."
"In Germany, the Bitkom-ifo-Digitalindex, calculated on the basis of the business situation and expectations, decreased over the
course of the reporting year."
"The business climate in the IT and telecommunication sector stood at plus 9.8 points in December
2023."
"The ICT industry thus remains at a significantly higher level than the economy as a whole: the ifo-Geschäftsklima
Deutschland indicator was at minus 11.2 points in December 2023."
Cooling inflation and falling prices on the global energy markets could lead to moderate economic recovery in the coming year.
"Progress with the digital transformation and new trends in artificial intelligence could stimulate growth in productivity in the
medium term."
"However, significant downside risks continue to weigh on the economic outlook."

The following table shows the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate trends and the change in harmonized consumer prices
in our most important markets."
"Last revised: January 15, 2024."
"Telecommunications market
Demand for high-speed broadband – over the fixed and mobile networks – remains high."
"According to a study by the consulting
company Arthur D."
"Little, in 2023 the average mobile data consumption per user in Europe was 16 GB/month, an increase of
23 % year-on-year."
The study estimates this figure will rise to 76 GB/month by 2030.
"Average household data consumption
in Europe over the fixed network was 265 GB/month in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 18 %, and is expected to rise to
912 GB/month by 2030."
"Video content and social media usage are the primary drivers of data consumption, paired with a
growing share of higher-resolution content and the trend for live sports streaming."
The global telecommunications market is set to grow further.
"According to estimates by the market research company
Analysys Mason, global revenue from telecommunications services grew in 2023 by 3.3 % year-on-year."
"Revenue growth from
conventional telecommunications services is mainly driven by higher spending on data services."
"Analysys Mason expects the
build-out of fiber-optic networks and the growing demand for faster broadband lines to drive up average spend per user for
fixed-network lines, especially in North America and Western Europe."
"Analysys Mason also expects revenue growth in the North
American mobile market to remain consistently higher than in Europe over the coming years."
The telecommunications industry continues to be characterized by intense competition.
"Consumers benefit from a greater
range of products to choose from."
"In the fixed network, established telecommunications companies are competing intensively
with cable network operators, city network operators, and resellers, who predominantly make use of regulated wholesale
products."
Financial investors are involved in building out regional and supra-regional fiber-optic networks.
"In addition, internet
companies offering OTT communication services are also further intensifying the competitive pressure."
"Moreover, three or
four mobile network operators operate in each of our markets using their own network infrastructure."
"On top of this, we are
seeing mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) becoming established in many markets using the network infrastructure of
traditional mobile network operators."
"In view of these developments, the question is whether the intense regulation of telecommunications markets in the EU is still
justified."
"In October 2023, following an exploratory consultation on the future of the telecommunications sector, the European
Commission announced its plans for regulation in the form of the Digital Networks Act."
"The Commission wants to reform the
regulatory framework to strengthen competition and investment power in the European telecommunications sector, and plans
to publish a white paper containing detailed proposals at the end of February 2024."
"Germany
In January 2024, the industry association Bitkom estimated that total revenue in the telecommunications industry in Germany
had increased by 1.7 % year-on-year to EUR 72.1 billion in the reporting year."
"Revenue in the area of telecommunications
equipment grew by 4.4 % and in telecommunications services by 1.9 %, while revenues from terminal equipment were set to
decline by 0.7 %."

The industry association VATM estimated an increase of 0.5 % year-on-year in the number of broadband lines in Germany by
the end of 2023 to 37.0 million lines."
High-bandwidth lines are increasingly marketed in cable and VDSL/vectoring networks.
"The drive to build out modern fiber-optic networks continues: in addition to established telecommunications companies,
public utility companies, municipalities, and special purpose associations, as well as investor-driven network operators, are
increasingly active."
"The growing availability of high bandwidths in Germany and the large choice of HD content and video-on-
demand services are stimulating sustained customer growth in IPTV business."
"Providers are recording growth in broadband
revenue driven by rising customer numbers in addition to higher revenues per customer for broadband products and triple-
play bundles comprising telephony, a broadband line, and TV service."
"The trend to use convergent product bundles comprising
fixed-network and mobile offerings (FMC) also continued."
"According to VATM, service revenue in the German mobile communications market increased slightly by 1.0 % compared with
2022, driven mainly by the uninterrupted upswing in data usage, which grew by 22.1 %."
"Regulatory effects and sustained price
and competitive pressure offset the additional demand for data."
"Mobile data usage continues to increase strongly on the back
of growing use of products such as mobile video apps."
"Connected devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers (wearables)
are growing in popularity."
"Digitalization is continuing apace, and as a result there is also growing demand by the industry for more connectivity to allow
machines and production sites to be networked and to tap efficiencies in value chains."
"Extensive IT and cloud solutions, as well
as intelligent approaches to M2M communication are needed in order to meet these demands."
"United States
To meet the ongoing demand for faster networks in 2023, U.S."
"broadband providers continued to expand their network
capacities with further wireless and fiber deployments."
"T‑Mobile US announced that at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 its network now covered more than 300 million Americans
with its Ultra Capacity 5G."
"Competitor Verizon said by mid-2023 more than 200 million people in the United States had access
to Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband."
And AT&T said its 5G network served nearly 288 million people in the United States.
"Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), providing high-speed internet to homes and businesses, remained the primary technology
driving fixed broadband growth, putting the United States at the forefront of FWA development."
"Wireless providers have used
FWA to enter the fixed broadband market, while fixed internet service providers with access to 5G spectrum use FWA to
complement broadband access in locations where fiber access networks are not present."
"In the United States, FWA has also
been used to help bridge the digital divide in rural locations where laying fiber is not economical."
"T‑Mobile US and Verizon
are leading the FWA expansion, with T‑Mobile US announcing 4.8 million fixed broadband customers at the end of the fourth
quarter of 2023 and Verizon featuring around 3 million customers at the end of the same quarter."
"Fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) deployments saw a record year, with the number of FTTH homes passed and being marketed to
consumers in the United States growing 13 % in 2023 to 78 million homes."
"Fiber deployments are expected to further expand
with the support of the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program (BEAD)."
"The BEAD program provides
USD 42.45 billion to fund primarily fiber-based broadband expansion projects in unserved and underserved areas of the United
States."
Planning grants have been awarded to states around the country and further distributions are ahead in 2024.
"Carriers in the United States are continuing to evaluate options for a shift in communications network architecture from closed
proprietary interfaces toward Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) deployment."
"AT&T on December 4, 2023, announced
it plans to lead the United States in commercial scale Open RAN deployment through a collaboration with Swedish vendor
Ericsson."
AT&T said its spend could approach roughly USD 14 billion over the 5-year term with Ericsson.
"The news was seen as
a potentially big boost for Open RAN technology."
"regulator for the telecommunications sector, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in 2023 began a
proceeding to reintroduce net neutrality regulations along the lines of the 2015 regulations."
"The agency is expected to issue
final regulations in 2024, following a public consultation."

Europe
In the reporting year, the telecommunications markets in our segment continued to feel the adverse effects of world events,
and in particular geopolitical tensions."
"Inflation drove up energy and producer prices in early 2023, while financing conditions
for private households and businesses deteriorated on the back of higher interest rates, putting overall economic demand
under further pressure."
"The inflation-induced changes in consumer prices lost momentum in the countries of our segment over
the course of the year, but remain at a comparatively high level."
"This resulted in numerous telecommunications companies
adapting their rate plans in agreement with the local regulatory authority to offset rising costs, leading to customers making
economies in their selection of telecommunications products."
"Nevertheless, demand for broadband and TV services remained
high."
"This is also reflected in Analysys Mason’s figures for the fixed-network business (excluding systems solutions) for the first
half of 2023: the business grew, driven in particular by the sharp increase in broadband business, by around 4 %."
"This offset the
decline in revenues from voice telephony."
TV and mobile business also performed better than in the prior year.
"The market players in our European footprint focused their acquisition activities in the reporting year on becoming providers of
convergent product bundles comprising fixed-network and mobile services (FMC)."
"In countries such as Greece and Poland, the
integration continued to progress during the reporting year."
"One year after the respective takeovers of Nova and Wind in Greece
and Play and UPC in Poland, legal mergers took place in both countries and the brands were streamlined (leaving just the Nova
brand in Greece and Play in Poland)."
"In Hungary, following a slew of acquisitions, the ICT group 4iG shifted its focus to the
operational and brand-specific integration of the entire portfolio."
"The acquisitions in the prior year are causing the competitive
situation to intensify in many countries, but especially Greece."
"In terms of the acquisition of spectrum licenses, there was only
limited activity on the markets in the reporting year."
"However, the activities of the cell tower businesses picked up pace."
Convergent product bundles are now established in our markets and consistently post high growth rates.
"According to Analysys
Mason, the number of FMC customers continued to grow year-on-year in the first half of 2023 by around 6 % and revenues
by around 7 %."
"At the end of 2023, year-on-year growth in this area had reached double digits in our national companies."
"Integrated convenience packages such as MagentaOne remained one of the most popular options among our customers,
which had a positive impact on customer satisfaction and reduced churn rates significantly compared to individual products."
"In the reporting year, competitors increasingly moved towards value- and customer-oriented FMC offerings."
"In Hungary, the
ICT group 4iG became a fully-fledged convergent provider due to the acquisition of Vodafone Hungary and UPC Hungary, and
plans to launch its new FMC offering “One” in 2024."
"In Greece, the United Group completed its takeover of Wind Hellas, and
bundled Wind and Nova services to create a convergent operator."
"This made the company the second largest competitor for
fixed-network and pay-TV services."
Subscription-based streaming services continue to gain in relevance in the markets of our segment.
"For example, SkyShowtime
– a joint venture of Paramount Global and Comcast – completed its roll-out in our markets in 2023."
"This international portfolio
comprises Netflix, Disney+, HBOmax, and SkyShowtime, and is competing against local services with varying positions of
strength, depending on the market."
"Services providing local content, such as Voyo in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, reported
strong customer growth, while other services, like RTL+ in Hungary, have struggled to gain traction."
"Most of these local
providers deliver a broader mix of content combining local and international TV movies and series with sports programming,
etc."
"While this type of portfolio composition fundamentally poses a higher risk of substituting traditional pay-TV business, the
risk is (still) at a manageable level."
"Despite this, the appeal of this business model is evidenced by the year-on-year growth:
according to Analysys Mason, revenues with streaming services in Europe and the customer base both posted further strong
growth as of the end of the first half of 2023."
"In 2023, the European telecommunications market was dominated by technological advances, regulatory changes,
cybersecurity concerns, competition, remote working requirements, a focus on sustainability and green initiatives, supply chain
challenges, and increased inflationary pressure."
"Over the course of the year, the B2B business adapted to these changing
economic circumstances."
"Influenced by the European Commission’s Green Deal, the telecommunications sector will take on a
central role as strategic partner and bolster Europe’s ability to build towards greater resilience."
"In 2023, the European markets
continued their rapid adoption of technologies such as 5G, competitive broadband networks, and digital services like software
defined networks, cybersecurity, and cloud computing, laying the foundation for the digital and green transformation."
"Systems Solutions
In the IT industry, the revenue volume that can be addressed by our Systems Solutions operating segment in our core market
of Western Europe under the T‑Systems brand increased by 4.6 % in the reporting year to EUR 187 billion."
"Companies continue
to invest in digital solutions."

In Germany, in terms of IT services, demand has grown further for public cloud services and cybersecurity services, as has
the importance of digitalization (including Industry 4.0)."
"The security market in Western Europe addressed by T‑Systems
grew by 10.4 % in 2023."
"The health sector also developed positively, posting double-digit growth rates in areas including
electronic patient files, digital health innovations, and the healthcare cloud in Germany."
"By contrast, growth slowed in the
market segments for traditional IT infrastructure and SAP services."
Competitive and price pressure persisted in all submarkets of our Systems Solutions operating segment.
"This was due on
the one hand to competitors from traditional IT services business, such as IBM, Atos, and Capgemini, and on the other to
cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud."
"Prices were eroded further by providers of
services that are delivered primarily offshore (e.g., Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro)."
"Major regulatory decisions
Our business activities are largely subject to national, European, and U.S."
"regulation, which is associated with extensive powers
to intervene in our product design and pricing, particularly in Europe."
"We were still subject to extensive regulation in our fixed-
network and mobile businesses in 2023."
"Regulation
Ongoing court case on the approval under merger control law for the joint venture Glasfaser NordWest."
"On
September 12, 2023, the Federal Court of Justice admitted the appeal filed by the Bundeskartellamt and Telekom Deutschland
against the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court’s decision dated September 22, 2021."
"The Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court
had decided to reverse the Bundeskartellamt’s approval under merger control law of the joint venture Glasfaser NordWest."
"Telekom Deutschland and EWE had established the joint venture Glasfaser NordWest in 2020 to bring fast internet to up to
1.5 million households and business locations."
"The September 12, 2023 decision now paves the way for the Federal Court of
Justice to open a legal review into the reversal of the approval."
"The joint venture can continue building out FTTH until the
Bundeskartellamt decides otherwise."
Bundesnetzagentur’s regulatory procedures based on the decision on access regulation including FTTB/H network access.
"The procedure on the reference offer for active
FTTB/H services is also under way."
"The commitment agreements for VDSL and FTTB/H agreed until the end of 2031 had already
passed the extended review conducted by the Bundesnetzagentur in 2022."
"Awarding of spectrum
At the multi-band auction in Croatia, which began with a bidding phase on January 17, 2023, Hrvatski Telekom secured an
above-average package of spectrum, comprising the largest share of spectrum (2x 105 MHz), for around EUR 135 million."
"In
Poland, the bidding phase for the 3,400 to 3,800 MHz band award ended on October 18, 2023."
"T‑Mobile Polska purchased
100 MHz of this spectrum for around EUR 111 million, securing one of the two spectrum blocks with the fewest technical
constraints."
The Austrian regulatory authority RTR has begun the procedure to award 26 GHz millimeter wave spectrum.
"It also plans to
award residual frequencies in the 3,400 to 3,800 MHz band from the 2019 auction in the same procedure."
"A public consultation
on the tender conditions is under way."
RTR expects the bidding process to start in the first quarter of 2024.
"In Poland, the award
procedure for the 700 MHz band and, if applicable, for spectrum in the 26 GHz band could also potentially begin in 2024."
"In
the Czech Republic, the procedure to extend the 900/1,800 MHz GSM license, which expires in 2024, is expected to begin at
the start of 2024."
"In Slovakia meanwhile, the procedure (auction) to re-award spectrum in the 900 MHz and 2,100 MHz bands
announced for the end of 2023 is at stake following calls by several parties to re-examine the auction conditions."
"The extension periods
under discussion are for five or eight years."
"In the United States, the U.S."
"regulator for the telecommunications sector, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
did not hold any spectrum auctions in 2023."
"The FCC’s spectrum auction authority expired on March 9, 2023 and has yet
to be reauthorized by the U.S."
"Congress passed a narrow bill – the “5G Sale Act” – that gives the
FCC the temporary authority to assign licenses purchased in the 2022 2.5 GHz spectrum auction."
"The law took effect on
December 19, 2023 and provides the FCC with 90 days to process the license assignments."
"At Auction 108 in
September 2022, T‑Mobile U.S."
acquired spectrum for around USD 0.3 billion (EUR 0.3 billion).
"The allocation of the licenses
was delayed on account of the expiry of the FCC’s authority, but is now expected in the first quarter of 2024."

"c Currently, the terms and conditions of the auction are being reviewed and as a result postponement is under discussion."
"Agreements on spectrum licenses
On August 8, 2022, T‑Mobile US entered into agreements with Channel 51 License and LB License for the acquisition of
spectrum in the 600 MHz band in exchange for total cash consideration of USD 3.5 billion (EUR 3.2 billion)."
"On March 30, 2023,
the contractual parties further agreed that the transaction be divided into two separate tranches."
"The transfer of the licenses in
accordance with the agreements is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions."
"The Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) approved the first tranche of the license transfer on December 29, 2023."
"T‑Mobile US
expects the first tranche to be concluded in the second quarter of 2024, and the second tranche in late 2024/early 2025."
"On July 1, 2020, T‑Mobile US and DISH Network Corporation (DISH) reached an agreement on the sale of spectrum licenses,
under which DISH agreed to purchase certain 800 MHz spectrum licenses from T‑Mobile US for USD 3.6 billion
(EUR 3.3 billion)."
The transaction is subject to approval by the FCC.
"The extension fee is fully creditable against the purchase price provided DISH exercises its option to purchase the
spectrum by this date."
"If DISH does not purchase the spectrum licenses, T‑Mobile US is obligated to put the licenses up for sale
at auction."
"Should bidding not reach the defined minimum purchase price of USD 3.6 billion, T‑Mobile US would be released
from its obligation to sell the licenses."
"On September 12, 2023, T‑Mobile US agreed with U.S."
"cable network operator Comcast to acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz
band in exchange for total cash consideration of between USD 1.2 billion and USD 3.3 billion (EUR 1.1 billion and
EUR 3.0 billion)."
"The final purchase price will be determined at the time the parties make the required transfer filings with the
FCC once it is decided which spectrum Comcast intends to sell."
"The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2028,
pending approval from the FCC."
"At the same time, T‑Mobile US and Comcast have agreed exclusive leasing arrangements."
"The
leasing rights for T‑Mobile US will apply for at least two years, even if Comcast elects to remove some of its licenses from the
purchase agreement."

Our T is shining brightly."
Deutsche Telekom is part of society.
"We take our responsibility seriously, well beyond our customer
relationships: We provide stability to others, by supporting refugees, rebuilding infrastructure after natural disasters, taking an
active stance against online hate speech, or supporting the Special Olympics."
"Our position at Deutsche Telekom is clear: We
are inclusive."
We give a voice to everyone.
And that is truly the source of our pride as a Company.
We met our key corporate targets in 2023.
"We closed significant transactions, in particular the sale of GD Towers, and we
secured a majority stake in T‑Mobile US."
We achieved our annual build-out targets.
"In the United States, we once again recorded
strong growth in customer numbers, especially in postpaid."
"In Europe and Germany, our integrated offers continue to enjoy
strong demand."
"This is also reflected in our key financials: We raised our guidance for adjusted EBITDA AL and free cash flow AL
(before spectrum) for the 2023 financial year, for the former, several times over the course of the year."
"Net revenue decreased
by 2.1 % to EUR 112.0 billion, mainly due to exchange rate effects."
"In organic terms, however, revenue increased slightly."
"High-
value service revenue also increased slightly to EUR 92.9 billion."
Adjusted EBITDA AL grew to EUR 40.5 billion.
"The main reason for this increase is sound operational development and further
enhanced cost efficiency."
"EBIT increased significantly to EUR 33.8 billion, mainly due to the gain on deconsolidation from the
sale of GD Towers."
"Loss from financial activities increased, primarily due to a lower share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures accounted
for using the equity method following an impairment loss on our stake in GD Towers."
"This impairment loss was due entirely
to higher discount rates due to macroeconomic developments in the reporting year."
"By contrast, the business outlook for
GD Towers improved slightly."
"Finance costs were negatively impacted, partly by the sale and leaseback of passive network
infrastructure in Germany and Austria in connection with the sale of GD Towers."
"Adjusted net profit decreased accordingly to
EUR 7.9 billion."
Adjusted earnings per share fell to EUR 1.60.
ROCE increased significantly year-on-year to 9.0 %.
"This was due to significant growth in net operating profit after taxes
(NOPAT), while the average amount of net operating assets (NOA) remained almost constant over the year."
"This was mainly
down to the sale of GD Towers."
Net debt decreased from EUR 142.4 billion to EUR 132.3 billion.
"This was in large part due to the strong increase in free cash
flow (before dividend payments and spectrum investment) and the cash proceeds resulting from the sale of GD Towers."
"By
contrast, net debt was increased mainly by the share buy-back program at T‑Mobile US, additions of lease liabilities and right-
of-use assets, and our dividend payments."
"The trends in the industry, in particular on the European telecommunications markets, remain challenging due to ongoing
competitive pressure and strict regulatory requirements."
"In order to succeed in the future, we continue to invest heavily in
the key to our success: our network infrastructure and our technology."
"In 2023, we made Group-wide investments (before
spectrum) of EUR 16.6 billion."
"As expected, the largely completed network integration in connection with the business
combination with Sprint in the United States in particular had a positive impact on cash capex."
"In Europe, we remained
focused on the parallel build-out of our broadband and mobile infrastructure (optical fiber and 5G)."
"Including the spectrum
payments, this figure was EUR 17.9 billion in the reporting year."
"Our free cash flow AL (before dividend payments and spectrum
investment) thus increased by 40.7 % to EUR 16.1 billion."
"We are therefore still a solid investment-grade company with access
to the international capital markets."
"The rating agency Standard & Poor’s even raised our long-term rating in May 2023, and all
three major rating agencies also raised their ratings of T‑Mobile US in spring 2023."
"As communicated at our Capital Markets Day in May 2021, we want to underpin our strong starting position going forwards
with solid financial growth rates."
We will present our plans for the coming years at the Capital Markets Day scheduled for 2024.
We pursue a sustainable dividend policy for our shareholders.
"For the 2023 financial year, we propose a dividend of EUR 0.77
for each dividend-bearing share."
"This year, the dividend will once again be paid out without any deduction of capital gains tax,
and we expect this to be also the case in the years to come."
"We started our announced 2024 share buy-back program with a
total volume of up to EUR 2 billion on January 3, 2024."
"Following a weak stock market year in 2022, the stock markets were dominated by buoyant share prices in 2023."
"Growth
in the European telecommunications sector was clearly more restrained: The industry’s barometer, the Dow Jones STOXX®
Europe 600 Telecommunications, rose just 8.1 % by the end of 2023."
"By contrast, the T-Share closed 2023 up substantially by
16.6 %."
"On a total return basis, it was up by as much as 20.3 %."
Our goal is firmly in our sights: We want to become the Leading Digital Telco.
"To this end, we will continue to systematically
transform ourselves into a simple, digital, and in every way agile company, harnessing the synergies within our Group to hold
our own against competitors and continue our success of the last few years."
"The aim of building and operating the best
convergent networks remains at the core of our strategy and is an important driver for our growth areas."
"In the process, we
align ourselves long-term with the needs of our customers and put people at the heart of everything we do."
"Because we won’t
stop until everyone can #takepart."

Presentation of GD Towers."
"The sale of the GD Towers business entity was consummated on February 1, 2023, and GD Towers
has not been part of the Group since that date."

with the results actually generated for 2023 is not like for like, i.e., these figures are not based on comparable exchange rates
or a comparable composition of the Group."
"Below, we describe the results achieved on a like-for-like basis, i.e., at comparable
exchange rates and excluding the results of GD Towers up to the date of deconsolidation on February 1, 2023."
We can once again look back with satisfaction on a successful financial year.
"Overall, we met or significantly exceeded our
expectations."
"Despite lower equipment revenues in the United States operating segment, our revenue increased slightly in
organic terms, i.e., adjusted for exchange rate effects and changes to the composition of the Group, while revenues decreased
slightly on an inorganic basis."
Our service revenue grew substantially by 3.6 % on an organic basis.

increased in organic terms by 4.0 %, despite the strategic withdrawal from the terminal equipment lease business model in
the United States."
"Taking the premises we formulated for our guidance into account, i.e., excluding the results of GD Towers
and negative exchange rate effects, we met our most recently communicated guidance of around EUR 41.1 billion."
"In line with
our strong operational performance, adjusted earnings per share met our guidance at EUR 1.60, when taking into account the
exchange rate assumed when formulating our guidance."
"As expected, we also recorded a strong increase of 9.0 % for ROCE due
to income from the sale of shares in GD Towers."
"At EUR 16.1 billion, free cash flow AL (before dividend payments and spectrum
investment) clearly exceeded our latest guidance of over EUR 16.1 billion, taking negative exchange rate effects into account."
"Cash capex (before spectrum investment), taking negative exchange rate effects into account, was as expected."

c Calculated according to the market-based method of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
We are also largely on track with our non-financial performance indicators.
"In our domestic market of Germany, we even
recorded a strong increase of 13.2 % in mobile customers, due in part to the high-value contract customer business under
the Deutsche Telekom and congstar brands."
Fixed-network and broadband lines developed as expected.
"In the United States
operating segment, postpaid and prepaid customer numbers increased in line with our expectations."
"Our Europe operating
segment recorded growth in customer numbers as expected, with fixed-network lines even recording an increase, thanks
primarily to a strong increase in the Czech Republic."
"Order entry in our Systems Solutions operating segment fell short of the
stated guidance, mainly due to the high-volume deals concluded in the prior year."
"Furthermore, the original planning did not
take into account the reassignment of Multimedia Solutions to the Germany operating segment."
"At the end of the reporting year, customer satisfaction came in at 76.2 points compared with an adjusted baseline figure of
75.0 points at the start of the year."
"Following changes to the revenue shares contributed by each country and in order to create
an equivalent basis for comparing the Group’s expectations with actual figures, we recalculated the baseline figure for 2023
on the basis of the new structures these changes entailed."
"The new baseline thus diverges from the figure of 76.0 reported
as of December 31, 2022."
"The Germany, Europe, and Systems Solutions operating segments contributed to the ongoing
positive development with improvements in customer loyalty."
"Employee satisfaction remained at a high level of 76 points in
2023, although this is down slightly against the prior year."
"The slight dip in the engagement score is attributable in part to
transformation processes in some business units, which have been challenging for parts of the workforce as they have entailed,
for example, a need for adjustments in skills development."
"The Group’s energy consumption and CO2 emissions recorded an
encouraging decline instead of the expected slight increase or increase, respectively, because in particular the United States
was able to achieve greater savings than expected in the original planning."
"The GD Towers business entity had been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as
a discontinued operation from the third quarter of 2022 until its sale."
"By contrast, we use the management approach for
the presentation in the combined management report, i.e., the financial performance indicators presented in the results of
operations still include the value contributions from GD Towers up to and including January 2023."

Prior-year comparatives were adjusted retrospectively.
"The net
negative exchange rate effects were primarily attributable to the translation of U.S."
"Revenue, service revenue
In the reporting year, we generated net revenue of EUR 112.0 billion, which was 2.1 % or EUR 2.4 billion down on the prior-year
level."
"In organic terms, revenue increased by 0.6 % against the prior-year level, including negative net exchange rate effects of
EUR 1.9 billion, with the changes in the composition of the Group having the net reducing effect of EUR 1.1 billion."
"High-value
service revenue in the Group increased by EUR 0.9 billion or 1.0 % year-on-year to EUR 92.9 billion."
"In organic terms, service
revenue increased by EUR 3.2 billion or 3.6 %."
"58
In our United States operating segment, revenue was down 4.0 % against the prior-year level, due in part to exchange rate
effects."
"In organic terms, it declined by 0.8 %."
This was attributable to lower terminal equipment revenue.
"First of all, the
migration of former Sprint customers to the T‑Mobile US network is complete, such that fewer devices compatible with the
T‑Mobile US network were sold to these customers."
"Furthermore, customers use their devices longer."
"In addition, T‑Mobile US
continued its strategic withdrawal from the terminal equipment lease business."
"The decline in terminal equipment revenues
was only partially offset by an increase in service revenue."
"In the Group Development operating segment, revenue development
was dominated by the loss of the value contributions of the sold entities T‑Mobile Netherlands and GD Towers."
"In organic
terms, revenue increased by 3.2 %."
The other operating segments recorded positive revenue trends.
"Revenue in our domestic
market of Germany was up on the prior-year level, increasing by 2.8 %."
"In organic terms, revenue increased by 2.1 %."
"This
was mainly driven by growth in service revenues in the fixed-network core business and in mobile communications."
"Build-
out services for our cooperation partners also had a positive impact on revenue."
"In our Europe operating segment, revenue
increased by 5.7 % year-on-year."
"In organic terms, revenue increased by 4.8 %, primarily attributable to the increase in high-
margin service revenues in the mobile business."
"Contract customer additions also had positive effects on terminal equipment
revenues."
"Revenue in our Systems Solutions operating segment was up 2.2 % year-on-year; in organic terms, it was up 5.3 %."
"This positive revenue trend was mainly driven by growth in the Road Charging, Digital, Advisory, and Cloud portfolio areas."

the higher indirect costs."
"In our Systems Solutions operating segment, adjusted EBITDA AL increased by 13.0 % or, in organic
terms, by 10.0 %, mainly due to revenue growth in the Road Charging and Digital areas."
"EBITDA AL increased by EUR 15.2 billion year-on-year to EUR 51.2 billion, with special factors affecting EBITDA AL increasing
by EUR 14.9 billion to EUR 10.7 billion."
"Net income of EUR 12.2 billion was recorded as special factors under effects of
deconsolidations, disposals, and acquisitions."
"The deconsolidation of GD Towers as of February 1, 2023 gave rise to income
of EUR 12.9 billion."
Another EUR 0.2 billion came from the sale of a subsidiary by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners.
"Net
expenses of EUR 1.0 billion, mainly in connection with integration costs as a result of the merger of T‑Mobile US and Sprint,
had an offsetting effect."
"In the prior year, net expenses of EUR 2.3 billion had been recorded as special factors under effects
of deconsolidations, disposals, and acquisitions."
"This included expenses of EUR 5.0 billion incurred mainly in connection with
integration costs arising as a result of the merger of T‑Mobile US and Sprint and in connection with payment obligations relating
to the agreement concluded at that time to sell the fiber-optic-based wireline network."
"In the prior year, by contrast, these
effects included income of EUR 1.7 billion from the deconsolidation of GlasfaserPlus and a further EUR 0.9 billion from the sale
of T‑Mobile Netherlands."
"Expenses incurred in connection with staff restructuring totaled EUR 1.5 billion, up EUR 0.3 billion
against the prior-year level."
"In the third quarter of 2023, T‑Mobile US implemented a workforce reduction program."
"The
expenses recognized as special factors in this connection amounted to EUR 0.4 billion."
"No significant impairment losses on
right-of-use assets or other special factors affecting EBITDA AL were recognized in the reporting year."
"In the prior year,
the impairment losses classified as special factors amounted to EUR 0.3 billion and mainly related to right-of-use assets
used in connection with the former Sprint’s fiber-optic-based wireline network."

Depreciation and amortization decreased by EUR 2.9 billion.
"In the United States operating segment, they declined due to the ongoing strategic withdrawal from the terminal equipment
lease business."
"Depreciation and amortization also decreased due to the complete write-off of certain 4G network components,
including assets affected by the decommissioning of the former Sprint’s legacy CDMA and LTE networks in 2022."
"The decrease
was offset by increased depreciation and amortization in connection with the further build-out of the nationwide 5G network in
the United States."
"By contrast, a further reduction in the
useful life of leased network technology for cell sites following the business combination of T‑Mobile US and Sprint increased
depreciation of the corresponding right-of-use assets by EUR 0.2 billion."
"In the Germany operating segment, depreciation and
amortization increased, partly as a result of the sale and leaseback of passive network infrastructure in Germany and Austria in
connection with the sale of GD Towers and the associated recognition of retained right-of-use assets."
"The impairment losses recognized in the reporting year amounted to EUR 0.2 billion and largely related to the Systems
Solutions operating segment and the Group Headquarters & Group Services segment."
"These related primarily to follow-up
investments in connection with assets previously impaired in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 financial years."
"Furthermore, despite
the business outlook remaining positive, the increase in the cost of capital in the reporting year prompted further impairment
losses to be recognized on non-current assets at the end of 2023."
"The impairment losses recorded in the prior year of
EUR 1.2 billion were mainly attributable to the former Sprint’s fiber-optic-based wireline assets in the United States operating
segment."
"For further information on depreciation, amortization and impairment losses, please refer to Note 27 “Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses” in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Loss from financial activities increased year-on-
year by EUR 4.4 billion to EUR 8.8 billion, mainly driven by an increase in loss of associates and joint ventures included in
the consolidated financial statements using the equity method from EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 2.8 billion."
"The main factor in this
was impairment losses recognized in the reporting year of EUR 2.6 billion and EUR 0.1 billion, respectively, on the carrying
amounts of the investments in GD Towers and in GlasfaserPlus."
"These impairment losses were due entirely to higher discount
rates due to macroeconomic developments in the reporting year."
"By contrast, the business outlook for GD Towers improved
slightly."
"The prior year included an interest rate-based impairment loss of EUR 0.5 billion recognized on the carrying amount
of the stake in GlasfaserPlus."
"Other financial income declined from EUR 1.4 billion to a financial expense of EUR 0.3 billion, in
particular in connection with the interest component from the measurement of provisions and liabilities."
"This decrease was
mainly attributable to the subsequent measurement using actuarial principles of the present value of the provision recognized
for the Civil Service Health Insurance Fund."
"In the prior year, the measurement was affected by the significant increase in
the interest rate level in that period."
"Gains/losses from financial instruments also declined, partly due to less pronounced
positive measurement effects from derivatives compared with the prior year."
"Net profit, adjusted net profit
Net profit increased year-on-year by EUR 9.8 billion to EUR 17.8 billion."
"Tax expense increased by EUR 0.7 billion to
EUR 3.0 billion."
"The tax rate was significantly reduced in 2023 by the realization of non-taxable income from the sale of
GD Towers."
"Taxes were furthermore reduced by deferred tax effects arising in connection with the sale-and-leaseback
transaction concluded."
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests increased by EUR 2.7 billion to EUR 4.2 billion.
"This
increase was almost entirely attributable to our United States operating segment."
"Excluding special factors, which had a
positive overall effect of EUR 9.8 billion on net profit, adjusted net profit amounted to EUR 7.9 billion, compared with
EUR 9.1 billion in the prior year."
The increase in loss from financial activities in particular had a decreasing effect.

"The transfer of T‑Mobile US shares to SoftBank in accordance with the supplementary

ROCE increased by 4.5 percentage points in the reporting period to 9.0 %.
"This was due to significant growth in net operating
profit after taxes (NOPAT), while the average amount of net operating assets (NOA) remained almost constant over the year."
The significant increase in NOPAT was mainly attributable to the development of special factors.
"Special factors totaling
EUR 10.5 billion had a positive effect on EBIT in the reporting year, whereas EBIT was impacted by overall negative special
factors amounting to EUR 5.2 billion in the prior year."
"The main driver for the development of special factors in the reporting
year was the deconsolidation gain from the sale of GD Towers and the reduction in expenses associated with the integration
of Sprint at T‑Mobile US."
"By contrast, at EUR 2.8 billion, the increase in loss of associates and joint ventures included in
the consolidated financial statements using the equity method had a reducing effect on NOPAT."
"This was attributable to
impairment losses recognized in the reporting year of EUR 2.6 billion and EUR 0.1 billion, respectively, on the carrying amounts
of the investments in GD Towers and in GlasfaserPlus."
"In 2023, NOPAT amounted to EUR 22.8 billion, up from EUR 11.3 billion in the prior year."
"At EUR 253.5 billion, average NOA
remained almost constant compared with the prior year."

Net cash from operating activities increased by EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 37.3 billion on the back of the good business
performance."
"Lower cash outflows in connection with the integration of Sprint in the United States also had an increasing
effect."
"However, the trend in net cash from operating activities was negatively impacted by the sale of T‑Mobile Netherlands
and GD Towers, as well as by exchange rate effects."
"In particular, the increase in tax payments of EUR 0.4 billion and the
increase in net interest payments of EUR 0.1 billion also had a reducing effect."
Cash capex (before spectrum investment) decreased by EUR 4.4 billion to EUR 16.6 billion.
"Cash capex in the United States
operating segment decreased by EUR 4.3 billion to EUR 9.1 billion, mainly as a result of higher cash outflows in the prior year for
the accelerated build-out of the 5G network and the integration of Sprint."
"In the Group Development operating segment, cash
capex decreased, mainly due to the sales of T‑Mobile Netherlands and GD Towers."
"In the Germany operating segment, capital
expenditure totaled around EUR 4.6 billion in the reporting year, EUR 0.2 billion more than in the prior year, with much of this
figure going towards the fiber-optic build-out."

as part of our integrated network strategy."
"In the Systems Solutions operating segment, our capital expenditure stood at the
prior-year level of EUR 0.2 billion."
"Lower investments in the Cloud portfolio area were offset by higher investments in the Road
Charging portfolio area, due to increased demand for on-board units."

repayment of lease liabilities reduced free cash flow AL."

continue to add new offerings to our portfolio."
"Mobile communications
The number of high-value mobile contract customers under the Telekom and congstar brands grew by 1.2 million customers
overall."
Sustained high demand for mobile rate plans with data volumes continues to drive this trend.
"The number of prepaid
customers grew by 5.8 million against the start of the year, primarily due to M2M SIM cards used in the automotive industry."
"Fixed network
Demand remained high for our fiber-optic-based lines, with the total number increasing to 20.2 million since the end of 2022."
"Two key factors are driving this strong growth: demand for higher bandwidths, and the technical migration of customer lines to
optical fiber under our “Turn customers into fans” (Kunden zu Fans machen) initiative, which concluded at the end of 2022."
"The number of retail broadband lines remained at a high level, increasing by 303 thousand in 2023 to 15.0 million."

"Wholesale
As of December 31, 2023, fiber-optic-based lines accounted for 67.4 % of all lines – 5.1 percentage points more than at the end
of 2022."
This growth is a result of the demand for our commitment agreements.
"Ongoing demand among retail customers for
higher-bandwidth lines also contributed to the increase."
"The number of unbundled local loop lines decreased by 609 thousand
compared with the end of the prior year, while fiber-optic-based lines increased by 337 thousand."
"These developments result
partly from the shift to higher-value fiber-optic-based lines and partly from consumers switching to other providers."

Adjusted EBITDA AL, EBITDA AL
Our Europe operating segment generated adjusted EBITDA AL of EUR 4.1 billion in the reporting year, up 3.8 % year-on-year."
"In
organic terms, adjusted EBITDA AL grew by 2.8 %, again posting a positive earnings performance, with a positive net margin
more than sufficient to offset the rise in indirect costs."
"This rise in costs is mainly driven by inflation-induced cost increases
(especially higher energy and personnel costs)."
"In Hungary, the supplementary telecommunications tax continues to have an
adverse impact on our EBITDA AL."
"Looking at the development by country, the increase in adjusted organic EBITDA AL was attributable to positive absolute
trends, in particular at our national companies in Hungary, Croatia, Austria, and Greece."
"These increases were offset by declines
in the Czech Republic and Romania, primarily due to one-time effects."
"At EUR 4.0 billion, EBITDA AL increased by 2.2 % against the prior year."
"The net expense arising from special factors was higher
than in the prior-year."
"Development of operations in selected countries
Greece."
"In the reporting year, revenue in Greece increased by 1.1 % year-on-year to EUR 3.2 billion."
"This trend is due to higher
mobile revenues."
"Alongside higher service revenues, the addition of new contract customers drove an increase in terminal
equipment revenues."
"However, mobile revenues were affected by termination rate cuts imposed by the regulatory authority."
"Revenue declined slightly in the fixed-network business, where traditional voice telephony revenues are tapering off."
"Wholesale
revenues also decreased as a result of lower volumes."
"Our convergence products, however, performed well, with further
customer additions and corresponding revenue."
Systems solutions business recorded a further substantial rise in revenue.
"Adjusted EBITDA AL stood at EUR 1.3 billion, up 1.1 % year-on-year, driven by lower indirect costs."
"Revenue in Hungary totaled EUR 2.0 billion in the 2023 financial year, which corresponds to substantial growth of
18.4 %."
"Excluding positive exchange rate effects, revenue increased by 15.6 % against the prior year in organic terms."
"The
biggest driver of this increase was mobile business, mainly on account of significantly higher service revenues."
"Fixed-network
revenue also increased markedly against the prior year."
"We recorded higher service revenues, in particular in the broadband
and TV business, both driven again by larger customer bases."
"Thanks to our increased investments in the build-out of fiber-
optic lines, our offers have won over large numbers of customers."
"Our convergence products also continued to perform well,
with further customer additions and corresponding revenue."
"Systems solutions business also recorded a significant increase in
revenue."
"Adjusted EBITDA AL stood at EUR 600 million, 21.7 % above the prior-year level."
"In organic terms, the increase was 19.3 %."
"The
increase in indirect costs, especially for energy, personnel, and the supplementary telecommunications tax, was more than
offset by the higher net margin."
Revenue in Poland increased by 7.7 % compared with the prior year to EUR 1.5 billion.
"Excluding positive exchange
rate effects, revenue increased by 4.2 % in organic terms."
"Mobile business was the main driver of this uptrend in revenue,
with growth in the contract customer base also having a positive effect on terminal equipment business."
"However, mobile
revenues were affected by termination rate cuts imposed by the regulatory authority."
"The number of FTTH customers in
the fixed-network business also increased significantly, creating the basis for further broadband growth."
"This is reflected in
higher broadband service revenues, and is also thanks to our successful partnership agreements on network infrastructure."
"The
number of FMC customers increased again substantially in 2023."
This had a corresponding positive impact on revenues.
"We
recorded substantial revenue growth in the systems solutions business."
"Adjusted EBITDA AL stood at EUR 393 million, 4.0 % above the prior-year level."
"In organic terms, adjusted EBITDA AL grew
slightly by 1.3 %."
"The revenue-driven increase in the net margin was slightly higher than the increase in indirect costs, in
particular as a result of higher energy costs."
"Revenue in the Czech Republic stood at EUR 1.3 billion in the reporting year, an increase of 4.4 % against
the prior year."
"Excluding positive exchange rate effects, organic growth was 2.0 %."
"This is largely attributable to our mobile
business, which recorded higher service revenues and increased revenues from terminal equipment sales, the latter driven
in part by renewed growth in the number of contract customers."
"However, mobile revenues were affected by termination
rate cuts imposed by the regulatory authority."
The fixed-network business also contributed to revenue growth.

"In addition to higher energy and personnel costs, a one-time
effect from the termination of a business relationship in the business customer segment also had an impact."
Revenue in Austria totaled EUR 1.5 billion in the 2023 financial year.
"This increase of 4.8 % was mainly attributable
to growth in mobile revenues, despite the adverse effects from the termination rate cuts."
"Alongside higher service revenues,
terminal equipment revenues also increased, driven in part by growth in the contract customer base."

needs: Advisory, Cloud, Digital, and Security."
"We have also defined selected industries (automotive, healthcare, public sector, and public transport), for which we have
increased our offer of vertical solutions based on our expertise."
"In addition, we have agreed partnerships with leading cloud

an even broader and more flexible range of cloud solutions."
"We are also increasingly expanding our portfolio with AI-based
solutions and data room offerings."
"By aligning ourselves in this way, our strategic goal is to become the leading IT service provider in the DACH region (Germany,
Austria, Switzerland) and in other selected countries."
"Order entry in our Systems Solutions operating segment decreased year-on-year by 8.2 % in the 2023 financial year, putting
it below our expectations."
This development was largely attributable to the high-volume deals concluded in the prior year.

"Revenue, service revenue
Revenue in our Systems Solutions operating segment developed more strongly than expected, increasing by 2.2 % year-on-year
in the 2023 financial year to EUR 3.9 billion."
"This positive revenue trend is driven by growth in the Road Charging (up 23.7 %),
Digital (up 10.9 %), and Advisory (up 3.4 %) portfolio areas, and by a slight increase in the Cloud portfolio area (up 2.4 %), which
includes our declining traditional IT infrastructure business."
"External revenue increased by 4.9 %, mainly driven by the Digital
and Road Charging portfolio areas."
"Service revenue also developed positively, increasing slightly by 1.2 %."

revenue increased by 5.3 % year-on-year and service revenue by 4.3 %."

In the 2023 financial year, adjusted EBITDA AL at our Systems Solutions operating segment increased by 13.0 % year-on-year
to EUR 321 million, which was in line with our expectations."
"The increase in adjusted EBITDA AL is primarily attributable to
revenue growth in the Road Charging and Digital areas."
"The negative impact of general price rises, especially in personnel
and energy costs, was mitigated by efficiency measures."
"In organic terms, adjusted EBITDA AL grew by 10.0 % year-on-year."
EBITDA AL increased by EUR 52 million compared with the prior year to EUR 177 million.
"The expense arising from special
factors decreased by EUR 15 million year-on-year to EUR 144 million, mainly as a result of lower restructuring costs."
EBIT increased by EUR 39 million compared with the prior year to EUR ‑71 million.
"The expense
arising from special factors was unchanged against the prior year at EUR 270 million."
"In the reporting year, this included non-
cash impairment losses on non-current assets totaling EUR 126 million."
"These related primarily to follow-up investments in
connection with assets previously impaired in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 financial years."
"Furthermore, despite the business
outlook remaining positive, the increase in the cost of capital in the reporting year prompted further impairment losses to
be recognized on non-current assets at the end of 2023."
"Impairment losses totaling EUR 111 million were recorded as special
factors in the prior year."
"Cash capex (before spectrum investment), cash capex
Cash capex in the Systems Solutions operating segment stood at EUR 210 million in the 2023 financial year, down
EUR 11 million against the prior year."
This trend mainly resulted from lower capital expenditure in the Cloud portfolio area.
"By contrast, capital expenditure in the Road Charging area was up year-on-year due to rising demand for on-board units."

The year-on-year decrease of EUR 37 million in EBIT to EUR ‑1,874 million was largely due to the decline in EBITDA AL."

"By contrast, receivables
decreased by EUR 0.8 billion and intangible assets by EUR 0.1 billion."
"At EUR 10.0 billion, receivables were down EUR 0.8 billion year-on-year, due mainly to a decrease of EUR 1.1 billion in
receivables from cash management."
"This decline was attributable in particular to the repayment of the cash management
balances with companies of the cell tower business in Germany."
"EUR 4.5 billion of the EUR 4.9 billion shareholder loan granted

"Receivables from cash
management of EUR 3.7 billion from Deutsche Telekom Towers Holding GmbH, Bonn, which were largely attributable to the
company’s profit transfer, had an offsetting effect."
"The increase of EUR 0.3 billion in other assets is due primarily to higher receivables from collateral (cash securities in
connection with hedging), which increased by EUR 0.2 billion."
"This change is attributable to normal fluctuations in market
values."
The EUR 0.1 billion higher receivables from accrued interest also contributed to this increase.
"The development of total shareholders’ equity and liabilities was mainly influenced by the increase of EUR 5.7 billion in
shareholders’ equity and of EUR 0.1 billion in accruals for pensions and similar obligations."
"The decline of EUR 3.2 billion in
financial liabilities, of EUR 1.0 billion in remaining liabilities, and of EUR 0.2 billion in tax accruals had an offsetting effect."
"The dividend payment of EUR 3.5 billion for the previous year had
an offsetting effect."
"The increase of EUR 0.1 billion in accruals for pensions and similar obligations was mainly attributable to the split-off of
pension obligations in the amount of EUR 0.6 billion of T‑Systems International GmbH, Frankfurt/Main, which took effect
retrospectively as of January 1, 2023."
"Payments of pension benefits of EUR 0.3 billion and a EUR 0.2 billion higher fair value of
the plan assets offset against pension obligations had a reducing effect."
"Financial liabilities decreased by EUR 3.2 billion year-on-year to EUR 9.4 billion, due primarily to a reduction in commercial
paper in the amount of EUR 2.3 billion and to repayments of loans and bonds amounting to EUR 0.9 billion net."
"The decrease in remaining liabilities of EUR 1.0 billion was attributable to a decline in liabilities from cash management of
EUR 2.1 billion, in particular as a result of the capital repayment by Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V., Maastricht."
"This was offset
by a EUR 1.0 billion increase in financial liabilities to affiliated companies."
"EUR 6.3 billion of this increase was from a loan
taken out from Deutsche Telekom Towers Holding GmbH, Bonn, in the amount of the purchase price payment received for
51.0 % of the shares in GD Towers Holding GmbH, Münster."

Deutsche Telekom International Finance B.V., Maastricht, in the amount of EUR 5.1 billion had an offsetting effect."
"85
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by EUR 4.0 billion year-on-year to EUR 8.7 billion and was mainly influenced
by income related to subsidiaries, associated and related companies and the change in intragroup cash management balances."
"The increase is due in particular to the repayment of receivables from cash management by DFMG Holding GmbH, Bonn,
amounting to EUR 4.9 billion in connection with the sale of 51.0 % of the shares in GD Towers Holding GmbH, Münster."
"Net
cash provided by operating activities in the previous year had been affected in particular by the sale of T‑Mobile Netherlands
Holding B.V., The Hague, and the funds drawn by DFMG Holding GmbH, Bonn, to create the target structure under company
law for the sale of the cell tower business."
"Net cash provided by for investing activities was almost reduced to zero, which corresponds to a decrease of EUR 1.6 billion
year-on-year."
"The main cash inflows resulted from interest received of EUR 0.9 billion and repayments of medium- and long-
term loans by subsidiaries in the amount of EUR 0.3 billion."
"The grant of a short-term loan to Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V.,
Maastricht, of EUR 0.6 billion and medium- and long-term loans to subsidiaries of EUR 0.6 billion, in particular to GD Towers
Holding GmbH, Münster, had an offsetting effect."
Net cash used for financing activities increased by EUR 0.8 billion year-on-year to EUR 7.5 billion.
"Net cash used for financing
activities primarily resulted from the payment of the dividend for the 2022 financial year of EUR 3.5 billion, from net
repayments of financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 2.1 billion, and from interest paid of EUR 1.8 billion."
"In all, this resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of EUR 1,288 million in the reporting year."

We also realigned the Global CR Board as a Group-wide steering committee in the reporting year.
"Our revised CR Policy was
adopted by the Board of Management in 2023 and started to be rolled out across the Group."
"These clear responsibilities are enabling us to establish the basis for achieving our ambitious goals – for example in the area
of climate protection: we aim to make our entire value chain climate-neutral by 2040 – from device production through to
power consumption by customers."
"On our journey towards climate neutrality, we defined new, more ambitious interim and final
goals in the reporting year that were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi): 55 % less CO2 by 2030 compared
with 2020 and achieving climate neutrality in 2040."
"To do this, we want to cut emissions by at least 90 % and offset up to
a maximum of 10 % using compensatory measures."
"This means that we once again obtained confirmation in 2023 that our
current climate protection goals contribute to compliance with the Paris Agreement."
"These and other measures have helped us reduce
our CO2 emissions even further over the past years."
"A growing range of sustainable products and solutions also enables our customers to reduce CO2 emissions and conserve other
resources."
"Our approach to resource conservation is holistic: our goal is for almost all fixed-network and mobile products we
bring into circulation to be recyclable or returned to the circular ecosystem by 2030."
"The return ratio for mobile and fixed-
network devices in the reporting year was 28 %."
"A more sustainable way of doing business not only has an ecological dimension, but also a social one."
"We want to give everyone
access to the digital world."
Making our products and services as accessible as possible is a new key aspect of doing this.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be particularly helpful in making processes more accessible."
"AI opens up new opportunities, but
also confronts us with new challenges."
"We at Deutsche Telekom are committed to bringing about digitalization that focuses on
people and values."
We were one of the first companies in the world to adopt Digital Ethics Guidelines on AI back in 2018.
"In the
reporting year, we launched a ChatGPT/GenAI expert group to advise us on how to integrate generative AI into our business."
"Putting people at the heart of digitalization – for us, this also means ensuring that people can use the internet safely."
"This
includes in particular protecting children and young people."
"We therefore launched the #ShareWithCare campaign in the
reporting year to raise people’s awareness about how to use children’s photos responsibly online."
"We also provided immediate assistance in the
wake of the forest fires on the island of Maui in Hawaii and the hurricane that struck Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina."
"From climate protection and resource conservation through to digital participation and practical emergency aid:
Deutsche Telekom has committed to being an optimistic and reliable partner for people in challenging times."
"This is what the
new brand claim, which we introduced in the reporting year, stands for: T – Connecting your world."
"Creating transparency
We have been reporting on our corporate responsibility (CR) activities for more than 20 years: on our website, in our CR report,
and in our annual report."
"Since the 2016 financial year, we have additionally explained how our core business contributes to
achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have been agreed as part of the 2030 Agenda."
"For further information, please refer to the section “Sustainable Development Goals.”
Since the 2017 reporting year, we have published a non-financial statement (NFS) as part of the management report in
accordance with § 289c to § 289e, § 315c in conjunction with § 289c to § 289e HGB."
"In selecting the issues to be presented
in the 2023 NFS, we took the statutory requirements into account."
"Deutsche Telekom makes a contribution to the environmental objective “Climate
change mitigation” through its taxonomy-aligned economic activities."
"The requirements for transparency in corporate
sustainability are constantly increasing."
"We are also getting ready for the forthcoming requirements of the Corporate Sustainability
Reporting Directive (CSRD) in a Group-wide, cross-divisional readiness project to align our future reporting with this legislation."
We will publish detailed information on this in our 2023 CR Report.
The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Telekom AG is responsible for the review of the content of the NFS.
"It did this with the
support of Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (external auditor) in the form of a limited assurance engagement."
"The two non-financial performance indicators “energy consumption” and “CO2 emissions” (Scope 1 and 2) are included as
management-relevant performance indicators in the reasonable assurance engagement on Deutsche Telekom’s consolidated
financial statements and the combined management report."
"The NFS engagement is based on International Standard on
Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (revised)."
"Unless otherwise stated, all disclosures in this NFS apply in equal measure to
the Group and the parent company (combined non-financial statement)."
"To avoid repetition within the management report,
we refer to further information provided in other sections wherever relevant."
"References to disclosures not contained in the
combined management report are provided as background information; these disclosures are not part of the NFS and thus are
not covered by the engagement."
"Our annual CR report supplements this NFS, meeting in full the requirements from a range of different stakeholders for
substantiated accountability."
The NFS is used by CR experts as an aid to rating Deutsche Telekom’s sustainability performance.
"In the reporting year, we have focused on combining ESG measures along the operating segments in the CR report so as to
more clearly reflect the Group perspective."
"This will also prepare us for compliance with the CSRD requirements that will apply
to us starting in the 2024 financial year."

The transparency of our reporting is acknowledged by external parties."
"In the reporting year, Deutsche Telekom’s sustainability
reporting received the Building Public Trust Award in the DAX category for the most transparent reporting."
"The topics of
taxonomy, climate goals, and CSRD readiness received special mention."
"For the best sustainability communication in the
NetFederation CSR benchmark, we again ranked second in the reporting year with 815 points, 3 points behind first place and
97 points ahead of third place."
"Sustainable Development Goals
In 2015, the member states of the United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"We want to make
concrete contributions to achieving these goals along our entire value chain."
Our contributions to achieving the SDGs have also had a positive effect on our own Company.
"In order to highlight these
contributions, we have divided them into five areas: Finance, Structure, Relationships, Employees, and Environment."
"At the
same time, this has a positive effect on teamwork in our Company (Employees)."
"By building out our broadband network,
we are making an active contribution to creating high-quality infrastructure, and promoting innovation (SDG 9)."
"At the same
time, we are strengthening our infrastructure (Structure)."
"We are making our network increasingly energy-efficient and using
electricity from 100 % renewable energy sources (SDG 13)."
"This is how we are making our own business activities more
environmentally friendly (Environment)."
"Our growing range of sustainable products and solutions increases this effect and enables our
customers to reduce CO2 emissions and conserve other resources (SDGs 12, 14, 15)."
"Our smart cities solutions also promote a
sustainable way of life (SDG 11)."
"At the same time, these offerings enable us to generate revenue (Finance)."
"Our commitment
to an internet free of hate and to more civil courage online contributes to a peaceful, inclusive society based on the rule of law
(SDG 16) and is associated with new cooperation relationships (SDG 17) for us (Relationships)."
"To clearly highlight the contribution our products, services, and activities make toward the individual sustainability
development goals and our value chain, we have marked the relevant passages with the respective SDG and value contribution
symbols."
"The symbols used are considered information extraneous to management reports in accordance with the explanation

Strategic and organizational approach to sustainability
We see ourselves as a responsible company and have made that a core element of our Group strategy."
"We are committed to
implementing sustainability along our entire value chain – and to playing an important role in meeting today’s environmental,
economic, and social challenges."
"We are expressly committed to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the
German Sustainability Code, and the Code of Responsible Conduct for Business."
"In addition, as already outlined, we support
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"Our CR strategy focuses on four key areas in which we want to act as a role model:
1."
"Our commitment to climate-neutral business practices
2."
"Our determined efforts to ensure the circularity of our products and services
3."
"Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I), and our investment in training for our employees
4."
"Our determination to help shape a digital society that is based on fundamental democratic values and in which all people
can participate safely, competently, and with autonomy
Good governance is the foundation of these strategic pillars."
"For us, this includes an internal control system and a risk
management system, including a compliance management system which is aligned with the Company’s risk situation."
"Our Board of Management bears overall responsibility for CR: it discusses and decides on the most important strategic
guardrails and objectives."
The Board of Management is advised and supervised in this task by the Supervisory Board.
"The Group
Corporate Responsibility (GCR) unit develops the Group-wide CR strategy, including the associated policies and guidelines."
"Its
aim is to further develop our corporate culture, particularly in terms of sustainable innovation, ecological business operations,
and social responsibility."
"Since 2022, the Chair of the Board of Management has been responsible for GCR."
"The Supervisory
Board and the Board of Management are thereby emphasizing how seriously Deutsche Telekom takes its social and
environmental responsibility."
"The Board of Management is informed every quarter about the status of the most important
sustainability indicators in the Group Performance Report."
"During the course of the year, the Supervisory Board is also regularly
informed by GCR about the sustainability strategy and the progress made in implementing it."
"Furthermore, a training workshop
on the role of the Supervisory Board as part of new sustainability requirements was held in 2023."
"Additionally, the former
Global CR Board was realigned in the reporting year as a Group-wide steering committee and preparatory body for the Board
of Management."
The different Group business units and segments are responsible for implementing the CR strategy.
"A governance structure
based on the overall responsibility of the Board of Management was established in the operating segments in 2023:
overarching CR responsibility for the segment lies with the relevant management."
"This delegates content adaptation and
implementation of the Group sustainability strategy to CR segment leads."
"The CR segment controllers provide support to
establish processes for capturing, consolidating, and analyzing ESG KPIs in their segment."
"Specific measures are driven by the
CR managers of each unit, who work together within the international CR Manager Network."
"Our values and basic principles are anchored in our Guiding Principles, the Code of Conduct, the Code of Human Rights, and
other subject-specific policies."
"The cornerstones of our sustainability management activities are formally set out in our CR
Policy, which is binding for all Group units."
"In order to continue driving forward implementation of our CR ambitions across
the Group, the Board of Management adopted the refined and revised CR Policy in February 2023."
"We then introduced a
process for implementing the revised version throughout the Group."
"At the end of 2023, the CR Policy had been enforced at
75 of 135 Group companies; the rollout will be continued in 2024."
We will publish detailed information on the CR Policy in our 2023 CR Report.
We record ESG data as part of our CR controlling and reporting activities.
"We use this data to calculate our ESG KPIs, which we
use to measure and manage our CR performance."
"The non-financial performance indicators “energy consumption” and “CO2
emissions” (Scope 1 and 2) that are relevant for remuneration are essential elements of the Group’s higher-level controlling
processes."
"This also applies to other ESG KPIs, such as the Energy Intensity ESG KPI and the Sustainable Packaging and Return
of Devices circular economy KPIs."
"Alongside the ESG KPIs, we also report other metrics and data with the aim of meeting
internal and external transparency requirements."

Growing numbers of investors are focusing on sustainability aspects in their investment decisions (Socially Responsible
Investment, SRI)."
"SRI investment products consist of securities from companies that have been reviewed based on
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria."
"The development of demand from socially responsible investors for the
T-Share is an indicator we can use to assess our sustainability performance."
"The Socially Responsible Investment ESG KPI
indicates the percentage of Deutsche Telekom AG shares held by such investors."
"To do this, we monitor sustainably managed
shares at fund level."
"For better comparability with other companies, the total number of shares given pertains to the number
of Deutsche Telekom shares in free float."
"Our Group-wide commitment to greater sustainability is paying off: as of
December 31, 2023, around 32 % (prior year: 31.3 %) of all T-Shares were held by investors who show concern for
environmental, social, and governance criteria in their investment choices."
"As part of our CR strategy, we have taken part successfully for many years in ESG ratings, which we select based on reputation,
relevance, and independence."
"When rating agencies give high marks to our social and ecological commitment, the T-Share is
included in the financial market’s sustainability indexes."
"In 2023, the T-Share was once again listed in all sustainability indexes
relevant for us as a company."

"Process for determining significant topics
For some two decades now, we have determined the topics that are relevant for our sustainability strategy and for our reporting
on the basis of a materiality process."
"This materiality process takes into account the applicable requirements of the German
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB)."
We continuously refine our materiality analysis.
"In 2023, key factors influencing
the refining of the process were the requirements stipulated in the CSRD, which will be relevant for our reporting as of the
2024 reporting year."
"However, since the CSRD will have the effect of changing the materiality criteria, we selected the topics for
the present NFS based on the results of the 2022 materiality analysis, which we reviewed in the reporting year to ensure it was
fully up to date."
"In the course of a document analysis, among other points, we explored existing and forthcoming legislation,
selected competitors, and the expectations of our stakeholders, e.g., the capital markets."
"We also considered the results of
existing materiality analyses from four national companies (T‑Mobile US, T‑Mobile Polska, Hrvatski Telekom, and OTE) in order
to incorporate a geographically and socially broad-based international perspective."
"In doing this, we considered both the
negative and the positive impact of our business activities on the environment and on society along the entire value chain."
"In
a further step, we assessed our financial sustainability opportunities and risks."
"The results were then validated in an internal
workshop with participants from various functional units."
"The participants also contributed the concerns of various external
stakeholders, whose views they are able to cover well due to their activities."
"This review process identified energy consumption
in the supply chain and transportation as an additional key issue."
"Although the two topics of “collaboration with employees’
representatives and trade unions” and “occupational health and safety” are no longer considered to be key topics, we continue
to include them in our reporting."
The key topic of “service quality” constitutes a central aspect of customer satisfaction.
"For further information on customer satisfaction, please refer to the sections “Group strategy” and “Management of the Group.”

We will publish detailed information on the materiality process in our 2023 CR Report."
"As part of our comprehensive risk and opportunity management system, we determine existing and potential risks and
opportunities arising from environmental, economic, or social aspects, and from our corporate governance."
"As part of this
process, we take into account the results of the financial assessment of the sustainability risks and opportunities in the
materiality analysis."
"We maintain the
practice of reporting on these matters in order to also meet the transparency requirements of our stakeholders."
"The present
NFS focuses on these risks and opportunities in relation to the relevant aspects."
"If harnessed properly, these
opportunities can contribute, among other factors, to protecting resources and saving energy."
"We amended our Group-wide
Environmental Guidance in the reporting year."
It collates the relevant aspects of our self-commitments.
"The amendments
reflect the increasing importance of issues such as the circular economy, biodiversity, and water scarcity."
"The Environmental
Guidance also contains an updated version of the EMF Policy (EMF being short for “electro-magnetic fields”)."
"The
Environmental Guidance was adopted by the Global CR Board in the reporting year."
"In order to handle the rising tide of regulatory requirements, especially from the EU (e.g., the Green Deal), we established an
internal, cross-divisional Green Deal task force in 2020."
"The purpose of the task force is to ensure that necessary measures
and processes can be implemented without delay and to create the necessary transparency."
"Correspondingly, evaluations and
indications resulting from the task force’s activities are taken into account in the Group’s various sustainability initiatives."
"Climate protection
Our investments in the network build-out make us one of the biggest investors in the industry."
"In 2023, we invested more than
EUR 16 billion Group-wide, primarily in building and operating networks to meet the growing demand for faster, full-coverage
data services."
"However, the network build-out is not to lead to an increase in CO2 emissions and thus accelerate climate change."
"For this reason, we use energy from renewable sources to decouple CO2 emissions from energy consumption."
"In Europe,
we have set ourselves the goal of doubling the energy efficiency of our networks by the end of 2024."
"Above and beyond
this, we want to further increase energy efficiency – for instance at our data centers – and thus reduce energy consumption
in the medium term despite the expected rise in data consumption (2024 against 2020, goal excludes T‑Mobile US)."
"In the United States, we are forging ahead with the highly intensive build-out of our 5G network, in particular
in rural areas."
This initially drives up power consumption.
"T‑Mobile US, like the Group as a whole, has covered 100 % of its
electricity requirements from renewable energy sources since 2021."
"There are fluctuations in T‑Mobile US’ Scope 1 carbon
footprint owing to unforeseeable natural disasters and the associated temporary use of equipment such as diesel generators to
restore and back up damaged network infrastructure."
"Consideration must be given to the special national situation in this key
market, which is why the decision was taken not to include T‑Mobile US in these two non-financial performance indicators in
respect of short-term variable remuneration."
"This step ensures that the right incentives are set for the Board of Management,

executives, and all employees in Germany not covered by collective agreements toward the sustainable development of the
business, while at the same time safeguarding the stability of network operations."
"The annual ambition for the performance indicators “energy consumption” and “CO2 emissions” (Scope 1 and 2) will continue
to be set, managed, and reported for the entire Group as before, including a target value for T‑Mobile US."
"Energy consumption
for the Group as a whole in the reporting year was down slightly year-on-year at 12,241 GWh (prior year: 13,253 GWh)."
"Due
in particular to the Group-wide use of electricity from renewable energy sources, CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) are at a low
level and dropped further as a result of our measures to 217 kt CO2e (prior year: 233 kt CO2e)."
"The values given for total energy
consumption and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are based in part on estimates, assumptions, and extrapolations, and, in part,
on data provided by our external energy service providers."
"For about the last two decades, climate protection has been steadily increasing in importance at Deutsche Telekom."
"Our Group-
wide climate protection strategy covers the following aspects: Emissions from the value chain, Renewable energy sources,
Energy efficiency, and Enablement: positive climate-protection effects on our customers."
"In 2019, the Board of Management
adopted climate goals, which it stepped up again in 2021: In March 2023, we replaced our previous science-based target on our
journey towards climate neutrality with more ambitious interim and final goals, which have now been confirmed by the SBTi."
"Our climate goals are:
a."
"We achieved 100 % electricity from renewable energy sources across the Group (Scope 2, market-based method) at the
end of 2021."
We are aiming to reach climate neutrality across the Company by the end of 2025 (Scope 1 and 2).
"As we cannot avoid all
emissions, we intend to offset around 5 % of the remaining emissions through compensatory measures."
"As a new interim goal on our journey towards climate neutrality along the entire value chain, we have committed to
reducing CO2 emissions across Scopes 1–3 by 55 % in absolute terms by 2030 compared with 2020."
"This interim goal
is considerably more ambitious than our previous goal, which was to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 25 % per customer
(compared with 2017) by 2030."
"As a result of our systematic efforts to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, the
majority (over 98 %) of our carbon footprint now occurs through the production and use of our products."
"We maintain a
close dialog with our suppliers in order to reduce the emissions generated during production and to ensure the products
manufactured consume less energy during the utilization phase."
We want to reach net zero by 2040 across all three scopes along the entire value chain.
"We want to cut emissions by at
least 90 %, so that we only need to offset up to 10 %."
"This goal is also in line with the targets set out by the European Green
Digital Coalition, of which Deutsche Telekom is a founding member."
"We have set ourselves the quality requirement for offsetting that we only use high-
quality removal projects in accordance with Oxford category IV and V, i.e., the removal of carbon through short- and long-term
storage."
We developed our Group-wide climate goals in line with the current scientific and political conditions.
"For the current targets,
the SBTi once again confirmed in the reporting year that our climate protection goals contribute to compliance with the Paris
Agreement even under its stricter new guidelines."
"We developed a Climate Target Transition Plan in 2023 that we will detail
further in 2024 in accordance with the future requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)."
"The plan
enables us to manage and monitor the success of our reduction measures internally."
"It also helps us to inform our stakeholders
about our journey towards net zero emissions."
"The SBTi also gave a positive assessment of the targets set by our subsidiaries
in the United States and Hungary."
The national companies are taking different steps to achieve these targets.
"These include
power purchase agreements (PPAs) for procuring electricity from specific sustainable sources, such as wind and solar power."
"At the end of 2023, we were obtaining 32.5 % of our electricity through these PPAs (prior year: 27.7 %)."
"By 2025, we intend to increase this percentage in Europe to 50 % of our power consumption."
"Our aim is to actively support the
sustainable production of electricity from renewal energies."
"As approximately three-quarters of Scope 3 emissions are attributable to the supply chain, we established the Supply Chain
Emission Reduction task force in the reporting year."
It prioritizes suppliers by their relevance to our CO2 emissions.
"The task
force agrees targets and measures with the intention to define binding emission reduction agreements together with our
suppliers."
"Suppliers also play an important role when it comes to reducing emissions from the utilization phase of the devices
we lease or sell."
Improving energy efficiency is one of the key levers here.
We calculate our CO2 emissions across the Group in line with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocol.
"The market-based method
is used for Scope 2 emissions."
"The standard distinguishes between three CO2 emissions categories (Scope 1, 2, and 3)."
"The
calculations for Scope 3 were partly based on assumptions, and the value for Scope 3 amounted to 10,476 kt CO2e (prior year:
12,287 kt CO2e) in the reporting year."
"This reduction partly resulted from methodology adjustments for upstream activities in
particular."
"The following graphic visualizes the emissions of the different scopes resulting from our business activities, shown
as CO2-equivalent emissions (CO2e emissions)."
"To our shareholders

Deutsche Telekom."
"In the reporting year, we took steps to improve the data quality by more precisely allocating the effects of our 
civil engineering activities to Scope 3 emissions from upstream activities."
"Scope 1 emissions from Deutsche Telekom’s own activities:
Primary energy requirements for operation of Deutsche Telekom’s systems, buildings, and vehicles
Scope 2 emissions from energy procured:
Generation of electricity and district heating/cooling procured by Deutsche Telekom."
"Renewable energy certificates are taken into account when Scope 2 
emissions are determined."
"Scope 3 emissions from downstream activities:
Transportation of products sold to the customer, use of sold or leased products, and disposal and recycling of sold products."
"Additional emissions are 
generated during the utilization phase of our solutions by devices that our customers purchase from third parties and not from Deutsche Telekom 
(prior year: around 2.6 million metric tons of CO 2e)."
"As we have only a negligible influence on these devices and hence on their energy consumption 
and emissions, we report these emissions separately."
"Due to methodology adjustments, this value has not yet been available for the reporting year 
at the time of publication."
"72.49 % (7,752 kt)
1.86 % (199 kt)
0.17 % (18 kt)
25.48 % (2,724 kt)
We will publish detailed information on the year-on-year development of data and the impact of the adjusted Scope 3 methodology on previous years in
our 2023 CR Report."
We determine the effectiveness of our climate protection measures using key performance indicators (KPIs).
"The Renewable
Energy KPI is an important metric for us."
"It shows how much of our Company’s overall electricity consumption is obtained from
renewable energy sources, and has been 100 % across the Group since 2021."
"Direct procurement, guarantees of origin, own
energy production, and PPAs are included in this calculation."
The Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric serves as one indicator for the efficiency enhancement in our data centers.
"We
determine this metric using the method recommended by the standard DIN EN 50600 for data centers, which takes the total
energy consumed by data centers into account, not just that used to operate the servers."
"In 2023, the global PUE metric for
our T‑Systems data centers was 1.53 (prior year: 1.59)."
Our most efficient highly available data center has a PUE of 1.24.
"In
the reporting year, the European Commission honored the T‑Systems data center in Biere with the European Code of Conduct
Award for significantly reducing its energy consumption."
The KPI for Energy Intensity for Deutsche Telekom (fixed-network and mobile entities) is shown in the following graphic.
"The KPI
reflects our energy consumption in relation to the volume of data transmitted, thus demonstrating how our network’s energy
efficiency has recorded positive growth."
The result stands at 70 (prior year: 91).
"We committed
to buying only electric company vehicles in Germany from 2023 onward, for example, and a policy to this effect came into
force in January 2023."
"On the basis of this, almost 100 % of the company vehicles we ordered in the reporting year had
an electric drive in Germany, apart from just two exceptions that were covered by the policy."
"We have also extended the
retention period for company vehicles from three to four years."
"In addition, our subsidiary Comfort Charge provides e-mobility
charging infrastructure in Germany."
"One target designed to support a nationwide charging infrastructure was to operate
more than 250 rapid charging stations by the end of 2023."
"We only narrowly missed this target due to various factors, with

approximately 230 rapid charging stations."
"The main reasons for this were local construction delays, late approvals, or missing
power connections, which prevented us from setting up the remaining stations in 2023."
"They will be successively installed in
2024 so that we will quickly reach the threshold of 250 rapid charging stations."
"Both our own fleet and third-party vehicles can
use the vehicle charging stations."
"In order to effectively curb climate change, many relevant players must work together, which is why we participate in national
and international associations and organizations, such as the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) and Econsense."
"We
are also working systematically on improving climate protection throughout our supply chain."
"Since 2016, the CDP supplier
engagement rating has assessed how well companies have integrated the topic of climate protection into their supply chains."
"In 2022, we were awarded an A rating by CDP and included on its Supplier Engagement Rating Leader Board."
"The supplier
engagement rating had not yet been announced for the reporting year at the time of the publication of this report."
"Our
CDP Supply Chain Coverage ESG KPI indicates the degree to which our procurement volume was covered by our suppliers’
participation in the CDP Supply Chain Program in 2023."
"A total of around 51 % (prior year: over 52 %) of the procurement
volume was covered in 2023 (excluding T‑Mobile US)."
"In the reporting year, 294 suppliers took part in the program (prior year:
247)."
"Resource conservation
Our goal is to make our product portfolio increasingly sustainable."
"To achieve this, we take a holistic approach to resource
conservation and are committed to the responsible use of resources along our entire value chain."
"We aim to make products
and materials as durable as possible and to ensure they are always recycled at the end of their lifetimes."
"Also, by providing
innovative, network-based solutions, we support our customers in reducing their own CO2 emissions and contributing to
climate protection."
Sustainable products are a key factor in competition for us.
"Using the Sustainable Revenue Share ESG KPI, we determine how
much revenue we (excluding T‑Mobile US) generate from products that make a contribution to sustainability."
"Revenues for
individual product clusters are partially determined using a percentage allocation based on assumptions."
"In 2023, this share
amounted to almost 43 % (prior year: 42 %)."
"We have recorded this indicator since 2014 using our own methodology, which
we adapted in 2022."
"As previously, a product can only be assigned to the sustainable product portfolio provided it is highly
likely that the product does not entail any of the seven risks defined in our methodology."
"Additionally, a product must offer at least one of five sustainability benefits."
"Reduced energy consumption, a reduction
in CO2 emissions, efforts to achieve a circular economy, a reduction in time required, and enabling social participation are
taken into consideration for this."
Cost savings are still considered as additional information.
"However, a cost benefit does not
constitute a sustainability benefit in and of itself."
"Revenues from the rental of devices in the fixed network were included for the
first time this year, making up around 1 percentage point of the total value."
"It is difficult to differentiate between data and voice
revenues when taking mobile broadband revenues into account, which is why this is based on assumptions."
"Owing to the fact
that the EU Taxonomy does not cover the major part of our business model at present, we are also reporting this KPI in parallel
for the reporting year."
We will publish detailed information on the Sustainable Revenue Share ESG KPI in our 2023 CR Report.
"The return, repair, and recycling of old devices should be a matter of course."
"By 2030, we want all of the fixed-network and
mobile products we bring into circulation to be recycled at the end of their lifetimes."
"We are implementing measures to increase
the return of used devices to achieve the goals we have set ourselves."
"We measure the progress we are making by recording the
return ratios for the aforementioned product categories and the number of reconditioned devices."
"The return ratio for mobile
devices was 25 % for the Group in 2023."
"More than 4.4 million fixed-network devices (customer premises equipment, CPE)
were taken back across the Group in the reporting year."
"In the Germany and Europe operating segments, 38 % of the devices
collected there were reconditioned for reuse."
T‑Mobile US has a different calculation basis.
"There, the returned devices are
sent to third parties who responsibly manage reuse, resale, and recycling."
"T‑Mobile US reports the percentage of recovered
materials that were reused and recycled in its annual Corporate Responsibility Report."
"We also want our suppliers to make
their devices and network technology circular by 2030."
"We ask suppliers to provide relevant information, including about the
environmental impact of the production and operation of individual products (life-cycle analyses)."
"We also evaluate information
on energy efficiency, spare parts supply, including software updates, the use of recycled materials, and the relevant packaging
solution – in particular with regard to eliminating single-use plastics."

In general, we work closely with manufacturers in many areas to make our product offering ever more sustainable."
"For example,
we stepped up our strategic collaboration with Fairphone – a vendor specializing in sustainable smartphones – in the reporting
year."
"In 2021, we introduced the Eco Rating methodology, in cooperation with four other European mobile communications
operators."
Eleven network operators are now using this rating methodology in 36 countries.
"More than 450 cell phone models
from 23 vendors were evaluated by the end of 2023 in terms of their environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle."
"The score calculation methodology is regularly reviewed on the basis of technical advances and changes in the regulatory
regime and adapted, if necessary."
"We use the Eco Rating to help our customers make more sustainable purchase decisions
and motivate vendors to reduce the environmental footprint of their devices."
We are also pursuing our goals in our packaging.
"Since mid-2022, all new branded products launched across Europe must meet the sustainability criteria laid down in our new
packaging guideline."
Packaging for smartphones that we source from our suppliers must also meet these criteria.
"We did not
become aware of any violations of the packaging guideline by suppliers in the reporting year."
"We verify compliance with the
criteria by means of regular factory audits."
We want to make the sustainability benefits of our products transparent for our customers.
"That is why we undertake testing
procedures to obtain recognized environmental labels."
"For example, several routers and mesh devices are certified with the
Green Product environmental label of the TÜV Rheinland testing service provider."
"The Blue Angel government environmental
label was also awarded to the system for taking back cell phones operated jointly by Telekom Deutschland and Foxway
Germany."
"We use our #GreenMagenta and #GoodMagenta labels for those of our products and initiatives that bring
sustainability benefits."
"#GreenMagenta encompasses Deutsche Telekom products, services, projects, actions, and initiatives
that make a particularly positive contribution to climate protection and the more responsible use of resources."
"#GoodMagenta
describes projects, actions, and initiatives that make a positive contribution to overcoming social challenges in the digital
world."
We have set out strict rules for awarding these two labels.
There must be proven sustainability benefits.
"The two labels
are only awarded after completing a defined process, which also includes a comprehensive impact assessment."
"This process
was validated by an audit performed by TÜV Rheinland in the reporting year."
"If there are clear disadvantages for society
or the environment, #GreenMagenta or #GoodMagenta will not be awarded, despite any potential advantages."
"More than
45 products from Germany and some European national companies, such as T‑Mobile Austria in Austria, Hrvatski Telekom in
Croatia, and Makedonski Telekom in North Macedonia, have already been awarded the labels."
"For example, we have labeled our
green network in Germany, which has been operated with electricity from 100 % renewable energy sources since 2021, with
#GreenMagenta, while our new MagentaTV Box G7, with a case made from biobased plastic and plastic-free packaging, also
bears the label."
We will publish detailed information on this in our 2023 CR Report.
Conserving valuable resources is also a goal of the Green Pioneers initiative launched by our employees.
"Our Green Pioneers
raise awareness among the workforce of resource efficiency in the workplace and also provide inspiration for our core business."
"In 2023, some Green Pioneers held courses on environmental issues for their colleagues, with more than 2,100 employees
in total taking part."
"As part of the WeGrow employee development program, we planted around 1,000 trees and shrubs in
collaboration with the Green Pioneers in the reporting year."
"We also used the Green Pioneers Day in the reporting year, marking
the fifth anniversary of the initiative, to develop new ideas and goals for the future work of the community with the participants."
"Environmental opportunities arising from the digital transformation
We can use our products, services, and activities to contribute to tackling many environmental and social challenges, as was
made clear in a comparison with the 17 sustainability goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations."
"In order to evaluate the concepts described in this NFS, it is important to also look to
the opportunities digitalization opens up for sustainable development."
We use the Enablement Factor to measure our overall performance with regard to climate protection.
"For this ESG KPI, we
calculate the positive CO2 effects facilitated for our customers through using selected products."
"Relevant emissions generated
by customers are generally taken into account."
"Rebound effects are taken into account based on studies and estimates by
experts, where it is possible to do so with reasonable effort."
We put this figure in relation to our own CO2 emissions.
"According
to this figure, the positive CO2 effects facilitated for our customers in Germany were 378 % higher in 2023 than our own CO2
emissions (enablement factor of 4.78 to 1)."
"The year-on-year increase (enablement factor of 3.76 to 1) was mainly due to the
substantial reduction in Scope 3 emissions."
"The usefulness of the KPI depends very much on the underlying assumptions, and
the solution-based approach means double counting cannot be ruled out."

"This standard is designed to increase transparency and
credibility and lead to improved comparability when calculating savings."
"As soon as this calculation guideline has been
finalized, we will adapt our own calculations and reporting to the new requirements."
"Compliance with the EU Taxonomy transparency requirements
The EU Taxonomy is designed to promote investment flows from the finance sector to businesses that are involved in
environmentally sustainable activities."
The EU Taxonomy is therefore aimed at helping implement the European Green Deal.
"As
a basis for this, the EU Taxonomy provides a binding definition of the environmental sustainability of activities and investments."
The EU Taxonomy Regulation requires companies to report on these economic activities.
"In 2021 and 2022, criteria for
the taxonomy environmental objectives “Climate change mitigation” (CCM) and “Climate change adaptation” (CCA) were
initially defined in the EU legislation."
"In June 2023, criteria were adopted for the remaining four environmental objectives:
“Water and marine resources” (WTR), “Circular economy” (CE), “Pollution prevention and control” (PPC), and “Biodiversity and
ecosystems” (BIO)."
These new criteria were applied for the first time in 2023 financial year.
"Under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the first step is to ascertain the taxonomy-eligible economic activities of a company."
"These
are activities that are covered by the EU Taxonomy and that therefore potentially contribute significantly to achieving the
environmental objectives."
The second step is to check whether these activities are taxonomy-aligned.
"An activity is defined
as taxonomy-aligned if it meets the technical screening criteria for a significant contribution to at least one environmental
objective listed in the Annexes to Delegated Regulations (EU) 2021/2139, (EU) 2022/1214, (EU) 2023/2485, and
(EU) 2023/2486."
"At the same time, it must not do any significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives and
must meet the minimum social standards (“minimum safeguards”) set out in Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852, which in
particular require compliance with human and labor rights."
Deutsche Telekom is a company in the information and telecommunications industry.
"The EU Taxonomy does not currently include criteria for the economic activity “Provision and operation of electronic
communication networks and services.” This means that most of our business model is not yet covered by the EU Taxonomy."
"As a result, the EU Taxonomy does not give us an opportunity to indicate our contribution to climate change mitigation in the
area of fixed and mobile network build-out and operation."
"We are active in various business and industry associations to ensure
that relevant and appropriate criteria are added to the EU Taxonomy to reflect our core activities in the area of fixed and mobile
networks."
"Among other activities, we took part in the joint feedback process of the European Commission and the Platform on
Sustainable Finance in 2023."
"96
On the other hand, the EU Taxonomy does provide a list of cross-cutting activities outside of our core business that are relevant
for our general corporate infrastructure, such as for fleet and facilities management and energy generation."
"They break the figures down into both absolute values and the applicable percentage of Deutsche Telekom’s
turnover, capital expenditure, and operating expenditure."
"As required by law, we will begin publishing disclosures on the
taxonomy alignment of the economic activity “Product-as-a-service and other circular use- and result-oriented service models”
(CE 5.5) for the 2024 reporting year."
"Method for ascertaining taxonomy eligibility and alignment
When ascertaining the taxonomy-eligibility of economic activities, we focused on our core business activities taking cost-
benefit aspects into account."
There was a slight change to the application of the materiality assessment in the reporting year.
Those activities identified as taxonomy-eligible were checked individually for their taxonomy alignment.
"However, proof of
conformity for avoiding significant harm to the environmental objective “Climate change adaptation” (CCA) was provided
comprehensively for all taxonomy-eligible activities, as we manage climate risks centrally at Group level."
"The only exception to
this is the United States operating segment, where management of climate risks is still in the process of being established and
therefore does not yet fully meet the requirements of the EU Taxonomy."
"No taxonomy-eligible activities were carried out to any
significant extent in the United States operating segment in the reporting year."
"We monitor compliance with minimum social
safeguards using a Group-wide management system."
"To avoid significant harm to the environmental objective “Climate change adaptation” (CCA), checking for taxonomy alignment
of all of the economic activities listed above requires an analysis of potential physical climate risks."
"We carried out a
comprehensive analysis of physical climate risks in the reporting year as part of our risk management activities."
"The climate risk
analysis was carried out using a recognized software platform based on the climate scenarios defined by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."
"In connection with the taxonomy-eligible activities, no significant harm to the environmental
objective “Climate change adaptation” (CCA) was identified, as individual local climate risks are minimized by existing
mitigation measures."
"The minimum social safeguards require a management system to monitor compliance with the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the ILO Core Conventions
and the International Bill of Human Rights."
We have made an express commitment to the principles listed above.
"We perform
human rights due diligence using a risk-based management system encompassing both the Group and our supply chain that
we use to monitor compliance with social and environmental standards."
"We also maintain a process of trust-based dialog with
employees’ representatives and trade unions."
"To prevent corruption and safeguard fair competition, Deutsche Telekom has
established a compliance management system that is aligned with the company’s risk situation and is externally certified at
regular intervals."
"As well as data centers operated by T‑Systems, we also included data centers operated
on co-locations in the assessment."

Only data centers that comply with the European Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres can be considered
as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in accordance with the EU Taxonomy."
"Five of the eight
locations directly managed by T‑Systems comply with this code."
"As we have not yet verified compliance with the Code of
Conduct through external audits in accordance with EU Taxonomy requirements, we are not classifying the data centers used
for economic activity CCM 8.1 as taxonomy-aligned in the reporting year."
"In addition, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy,
the global warming potential of refrigerants that need to be used in data center cooling systems may not exceed a value of
675 GWP (Global Warming Potential)."
This criterion is currently met by one data center that was fully refurbished in 2022.
"The
other sites currently still use industry-typical refrigerants that meet the criteria of the EU directive on fluorinated greenhouse
gases."
"We will make the change to taxonomy-aligned refrigerants as part of the regular refurbishment program for our data
centers."
"We will carry out a detailed review of the individual data centers’ compliance with the criteria for preventing significant
harm to the remaining environmental objectives in each case as soon as they fulfill the aforementioned climate change
mitigation requirements in full."
"These are solutions and products that have clear potential to
enable users to save CO2 emissions."
"When selecting them, we take into account solutions and products that are incorporated
into our Enablement Factor and Sustainable Revenue Share ESG KPIs, and/or that have been awarded our #GreenMagenta
label."
The technical screening criteria require a life-cycle analysis as evidence of the taxonomy alignment of the solutions in question.
"These must show that a solution results in substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions both over and beyond its entire
life cycle in comparison with the relevant reference solution available on the market."
"We understand reference solutions to be
alternative solutions that would typically be used in a company in our footprint markets."
"This assumes that the companies are
aligned with best practices."
"The technical screening criteria do not stipulate a specific threshold for “substantial” reductions
in greenhouse gases in comparison with the reference solution."
Deutsche Telekom offers a number of IoT solutions that can reduce CO2 emissions.
"As we have not yet prepared any life-cycle
analysis to demonstrate the effects of these solutions, they are not reported as taxonomy-aligned for the reporting year."
"In contrast to the prior year, the taxonomy-eligible business-related web conferencing solutions were analyzed by comparing
them with hybrid meetings to take account of market trends."
Significant greenhouse gas savings were demonstrated.
"For
instance, compared with hybrid meetings, virtual-only meetings reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 62 % (small
meetings) or 32 % (large meetings)."
"Of the workplace and cloud solutions covered by the life-cycle analysis, the Future Cloud Infrastructure, including the SAP
Cloud Services run on this infrastructure, reduced greenhouse gas emissions by around 9.7 % in comparison with decentralized
data centers operated by our customers themselves."
"However, this effect was below the threshold value defined in the prior
year."
"Future Cloud Infrastructure and SAP Cloud Services are thus reported as non-taxonomy-aligned for the 2023 financial
year."
"The life-cycle analysis also found that using the Open Telekom Cloud reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 47 %
compared with the reference scenario."
"The reference scenario is based on the assumption that our customers use their own,
decentralized server infrastructure for storing and processing data rather than the cloud solution."
"We therefore classify the
Open Telekom Cloud and all web conferencing solutions included in a life-cycle analysis as taxonomy-aligned."
"For the aforementioned solutions, we exclusively use infrastructure located in Germany."
"The requirements for the “Circular
economy” (CE) conform to current EU legislation, which we implement as part of our environment management activities at
our EU sites."
"We also require our business partners to provide evidence that the hardware used in the data centers is actually
reconditioned or recycled at the end of its service life."
"We record leases of devices to business customers and consumers in the Germany operating segment under the taxonomy-
eligible economic activity Product-as-a-service and other circular use and result-oriented service models (CE 5.5)."
"As
required by law, we will begin publishing disclosures on the taxonomy alignment of this economic activity for the 2024
reporting year."
"98
Cross-cutting activities
Deutsche Telekom has a vehicle fleet that includes both company cars and service vehicles."
"As we are pushing forward with the transition to a fully electric fleet, especially in
Germany and the EU, some of the new vehicles purchased already meet the CO2 thresholds set in the EU Taxonomy."
"We were
also able to provide evidence of the alignment of these vehicles with the other key EU Taxonomy requirements, which are based
on current EU legislation for new vehicles."
"As the choice of tires is left to the vehicle users themselves, we could not provide
evidence of the taxonomy alignment of tires for the reporting year."
"We therefore report capital expenditure associated with our
vehicle fleet as non-taxonomy-aligned."
"The definition of turnover according to the EU Taxonomy
is equivalent to net revenue in our consolidated income statement contained in the consolidated financial statements."
"In line with the EU Taxonomy requirements, the disclosures on capital
expenditures do not form part of a capital expenditure (capex) plan."
"The EU Taxonomy defines costs that relate to research and
development; building remediation measures; short-term leases; maintenance and repair; and any other direct expenditures
relating to the day-to-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment as relevant operating expenditure."
We do not generate any turnover with cross-cutting activities.
"Exclusively capital
expenditure was assigned to economic activity CCM 6.5."
"The lease of devices to our customers
in accordance with economic activity CE 5.5 does not overlap with the solutions that fall under economic activities CCM 8.1
and CCM 8.2."
"In addition, capital and operating expenditures were only assigned to cross-cutting activity CCM 6.5 if a direct
correlation with the reported turnover-relevant economic activities was excluded."
"The changes against the prior
year relate mainly to the first-time disclosure of taxonomy-eligible turnover and capital expenditure from the lease of devices
in accordance with economic activity CE 5.5."
"The largest proportion of taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure can be allotted
to property, plant and equipment (76.4 %; 2022: 69.6 %), followed by right-of-use assets (15.5 %; 2022: 12.3 %) and intangible
assets (8.0 %; 2022: 18.1 %)."
"To enable a statement of taxonomy eligibility at segment level, too, we also report
supplementary KPIs for the Systems Solutions operating segment."
"The taxonomy-eligible portion, determined using the same
calculation logic, is 35.0 % (2022: 36.0 %) in relation to net revenue of the segment, and 66.0 % (2022: 62.6 %) in relation to
capital expenditure."
"In second place, with 0.8 % (2022: 0.8 %) taxonomy-eligible turnover, is economic activity CCM 8.2, to which the business-
related web conferencing solutions make a substantial contribution."
"We also generated relevant taxonomy-eligible turnover
from leases of devices, which we added as new economic activity CE 5.5 in the reporting year due to the expanded taxonomy
criteria and amounted to 0.6 % of the Group’s total turnover."
"Economic activity CE 5.5 is additionally associated with relevant
capital expenditure of 0.7 % based on the total figures for the Group."
"Cross-cutting activity CCM 6.5 has only a supporting
function for Deutsche Telekom’s core business."

In the 2023 financial year, the taxonomy-aligned proportion of all economic activities of the Deutsche Telekom Group was 0.2 %
of turnover (2022: 0.5 %), 0.0 % of capital expenditure (2022: 0.0 %), and 0.5 % of operating expenditure (2022: 0.4 %)."
"The
taxonomy-aligned proportion results from economic activity CCM 8.2."
"The decrease in taxonomy-aligned turnover is largely
due to an optimization of the reference scenario with which emissions savings from our cloud solutions are compared."
"For the
Systems Solutions operating segment, the taxonomy-aligned proportion of turnover was 3.6 % (2022: 12.3 %), 0.0 % of capital
expenditure (2022: 0.1 %), and 0.0 % of operating expenditure (2022: 0.8 %)."
"For the Systems Solutions operating segment,
including Future Cloud Infrastructure and SAP Cloud Services would lead to a proportion of 11.5 % (turnover), 0.0 % (capital
expenditure), and 0.4 % (operating expenditure)."
"Given the high standards laid down in the technical screening criteria, the transformation is expected to be a lengthy process."
We plan to increase the taxonomy alignment of our economic activities on a continual basis.

for the digital society."
They are therefore of pivotal importance for our business success.
"Six Guiding Principles, representing

Codetermination rights play a key role in the digital transformation."
"Together with employees’ representatives and trade unions,
we want to create the working world of the future – with an eye to the needs of our workforce and the success of our Company."
"As the underlying laws and contracts vary from country to country, codetermination matters are managed locally with trade
unions and employees’ representatives."
Group management is generally involved in issues of particular importance.
"The works councils, central works councils, and Group Works Council represent the interests of Group employees in Germany."
Our partner representing the employees’ interests on a European level is the European Works Council (EWC).
"We also have
executive staff representation committees and representatives of disabled employees at unit, company, and Group level."
"The
EWC has been one of our established key dialog partners for many years, representing the interests of our employees in
countries within the European Union and the European Economic Area."
"The EWC has up to 32 seats (prior year: 32), 28 of
which are currently occupied (prior year: 28) (as of December 31, 2023)."
"Collective bargaining plays an important role and has
a long tradition at our Company, a fact made clear by the percentage of employees covered by collective agreements."
"As
of December 31, 2023, 74 % of employees in Germany were covered by collective agreements (prior year: 73 %)."
"We record
the Group-wide coverage rate every two years."
"As of December 31, 2022, it stood at around 45 %."
"In 2023, 45 collective
agreements were signed with the trade unions in Germany (prior year: 90), which is a testament to the close cooperation with
employees’ representatives."
We also monitored trade union matters in the United States over the course of 2023.
"The responsibility for national human
resources management matters in the United States lies with T‑Mobile US’ management, who are committed to exercising
this responsibility."
"Across the globe, Deutsche Telekom respects the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining
in accordance with national law."
"This applies to the United States, with employees at T‑Mobile US entitled to form or join a
trade union."
"At the same time, employees are also free to choose not to do so."
"In accordance with national legal requirements,
T‑Mobile US does not discriminate against employees because of a decision they have made about union support."
"Our human rights policy statement Code of Human Rights & Social Principles was expanded in the reporting year to incorporate
aspects such as the content of the existing Employee Relations Policy."
"The Code of Human Rights contains our globally
applicable self-commitment to uphold freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, among other elements."
"The new structure of the revised Code of Human Rights is also based on the requirements of the German Act on Corporate Due
Diligence in Supply Chains (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG)."
"Our employee survey, which of late has been carried out every two years, is a key indicator of the relationship between our
Company and its workforce."
"The employee survey was not carried out in the reporting year on account of a change in service
provider, and has instead been rescheduled for 2024."
"On top of this, we conduct pulse surveys (carried out twice a year, or
once a year in years when the employee survey is carried out), which give us a sentiment snapshot across the Group."
"The
most recent pulse survey was conducted in November 2023, with 77 % – i.e., more than 106,000 colleagues – participating."
"The survey asked employees about sustainability, among other topics: 81 % of those surveyed (prior year: 84 %) stated that
they identified with Deutsche Telekom’s environmental and social engagement."
"A total of 80 % (prior year: 83 %) believe that
Deutsche Telekom acts responsibly toward the environment and society."
"The values reflect the survey findings excluding
T‑Mobile US, since T‑Mobile US conducts its own employee survey."
"For further information on the employee survey and the non-financial performance indicator “employee satisfaction,” please refer to the section
“Employees.”
Diversity, equity, and inclusion
People from over 120 countries work successfully together at Deutsche Telekom."
"They all bring their diverse skills and
demographic characteristics to the workplace."
"Respecting the individuality of our employees and harnessing their diversity for
our joint success is just as important for our Group as developing a shared corporate culture."
"That is why the Human Resources
and Legal Affairs Board of Management department includes a Diversity team."
"Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Group Policy, the six Guiding Principles, the Leadership Anchors as guidance for executives,
and the Code of Human Rights are key cornerstones of our commitment to diversity."
"We are also a founding member of the
Diversity Charter corporate initiative and a member of the advisory board of the Beyond Gender Agenda business network."
"In Germany, for example, our collective agreements on remuneration and other matters reached with the trade unions ensure
transparent, gender-neutral compensation."
"We have developed action plans for each dimension of diversity so that we
can make our working environment even more inclusive and put our diversity strategy in place in the various units."
"For example,
we celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr and the Pride Festival together with our employees in 2023."

We are particularly keen not only to promote respectful interaction, but also to drive systemic changes in products and
processes and make data-driven decisions."
"For example, executives are now being trained and sensitized on the topic of
unconscious bias and other issues so as to avoid biased judgment in hiring and performance decisions."
"In 2023, we were one
of the first DAX companies to introduce a voluntary, anonymous self-identification questionnaire in a pilot project in Germany,
India, and Slovakia."
"This allows us to analyze the results of the employee survey across all seven diversity dimensions and
to derive specific recommendations for action."
More than 50 % of employees participated.
"This questionnaire is set to be
implemented worldwide in 2025."
"Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) are also rooted in the culture of T‑Mobile US."
"In 2021, T‑Mobile US launched its strategic
DE&I plan Equity In Action, which focuses on employees and on the key priorities of talent, culture, brand, and digital equity."
"As a part of the Equity In Action plan, T‑Mobile US established an External Diversity and Inclusion Council, which includes
members from civil rights and social justice organizations."
"The External Council helps the company identify priorities, goals, and
community efforts."
It also helps T‑Mobile US implement its Equity In Action plan and with the delivery of the DE&I promises.
"Alongside these action plans, we are also continuing to move forward on cross-divisional issues."
"These include mentoring
programs, flexible working models, child care services, advisory services for those caring for family members, a global talent
hub, and innovative ideas for dealing with demographic change."
"The regular collection of data via the pulse survey is another
measure."
"Questions were asked about nondiscrimination, a safe and supportive working environment, and equal opportunities
in the Company."
"In November 2023, the pulse survey resulted in a score of 91 % for nondiscrimination (previous year: 92 %) and
86 % for equal opportunities (previous year: 85 %)."
We also offer various training courses that shine a light on unconscious bias in order to reveal hidden prejudices.
"Additionally,
we offer training on the various aspects of diversity."
"In the Learning from Experts (LEX) format, employees regularly provide
input, including on issues with DE&I relevance."
"Finally, we support our numerous employee networks, employee resource
groups (ERGs), and corporate communities, in Germany for example MagentaPride, Women@telekom, the Fathers’ Network,
BIPoC@DT (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color), and the newly founded Network for Neurodiversity."
"At T‑Mobile US, there
are six internal diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) employee resource groups (ERGs)."
"The ERGs include a group for persons
with disabilities, a multicultural group with sub-affinity groups, a multigenerational network, an LGBTQI+ community, a network
for veterans and active members of the military, and a women’s network."
"Each of the ERGs also focuses on, and welcomes,
allies."
"For example, certain vaccinations and check-up services are also
available to the families of employees."
"We use holistic health management to take on social responsibility and promote a
proactive culture of health."
"We support our employees in maintaining their health and occupational safety with a host of
target audience-specific measures and extensive prevention programs."
"We consider the statutory requirements to be only
the minimum standard we must achieve."
"Our corporate occupational health and safety measures are effectively incorporated
into our structures via certified management systems and appropriate policies and guidelines."
"We support the Group-wide
approach with an internationally harmonized quality, work, health, and environmental management system based on the
international standards ISO 9001, ISO 45001, and ISO 14001."
"The Board of Management bears overarching responsibility for safeguarding health, occupational safety, and the environment."
"The Group companies have health and safety managers who are responsible for specific processes and offerings that take
into account special requirements and conditions right down to company level."
"We systematically evaluate the measures to
ensure they are effective."
"The health rate, for instance, is reported to the Board of Management once per quarter."
"In addition,
we review the results of our employee survey, analyses of stress prevention measures under collective agreements, health
insurance reports, and competitor benchmarks."
We analyze this data and use it to derive suitable measures.
"For example, we
have adapted our fire safety assistant concept and introduced an app for our employees to call first aiders in order to respond
to the changed conditions due to mobile working."
"Group-wide initiatives serve to promote health awareness and health literacy
among our employees."
"In Germany, a range of services are available to employees to promote health in the workplace, including
comprehensive check-ups, colon cancer screenings, and flu shots."
"To our shareholders

The health promotion program also includes courses on nutrition, exercise, and relaxation (stress prevention, mindfulness,
etc.)."
"As well as action days such as Mindfulness Day or Mental Health Day, there are open lecture series, individual offerings
(e.g., sleep advice, nutrition advice sessions), and digital solutions such as the Fitmit5 app to promote healthy break
management."
"Our employees can use the corporate health promotion options free of charge, generally during working hours."
"In addition, with our Germany-wide employee and executive advisory service, we offer a range of support services in the area of
psychosocial health, but also crisis prevention and advice in the event of personal hardship and extreme incidents."
"Since 2022,
we have been offering an advisory service for international employees affected by the war in Ukraine."
"We also provided special
support for employees and their families impacted by the disastrous earthquakes in Turkey and Syria in 2023."
"Standards have been put in place in Germany to improve occupational safety by regulating aspects such as safe, ergonomic
environments in buildings and vehicles."
"In addition to services available to all employees, there are also target group-specific
measures."
"Examples of these include driver safety training for certain areas of work or special safety training for employees
who are deployed to work at cell tower sites."
"As well as preventing accidents, the aim is to promote the health and motivation
of employees and therefore also increase the health rate."
"Several key figures validate our performance in terms of corporate health management services: the total number of work-
related accidents decreased slightly compared with the previous year."
"The accident rate in Germany was 5.2 accidents
(resulting in more than three days of absence) per thousand employees (prior year: 5.5)."
"At Telekom entities in Germany, the
health rate in 2023a, including long-term illnesses, was 94.3 % (prior year: 93.8 %)."
"Excluding long-term illnesses, the health
rate in 2023 stood at 95.8 % (prior year: 95.2 %)."
"The health index, which is measured as part of the employee survey, most recently recorded a slight increase of four points to
a score of 69 (on a scale of 0 to 100) in 2021 in comparison with the previous survey."
"Preparations for the next round of surveys
began in 2023."
"Aspect 3: Social concerns
Access to state-of-the-art information technology is key to participating in the information and knowledge society (Access)."
Ensuring that products and services are affordable is also important so that people can participate equitably (Affordability).
We also want to develop their skills and motivation to use digital media proficiently (Ability).
"The internet is supposed to be a
space in which all people can feel safe and where we interact on the basis of democratic principles."
"That is why we are actively
pushing for a positive culture of online debate, promoting the competent use of ICT, and making a stand against hate speech
and for civil courage online."
We aspire to enable as many people as possible to participate – also and especially in times of crisis.
"We are delivering on that
promise with an array of different activities."
"In this context, the security of our customers’ data is of prime importance."
"As a
relevant player in society, and committed as we are to exercising social responsibility, we also provide help in emergencies."
"There was particularly high demand for this help in the reporting year in light of the war in the Middle East, the forest fires on
Maui, and the earthquakes in Turkey, Syria, and Morocco."
"That is why we continue to rapidly expand our infrastructure and improve transmission
speeds with new, secure technology."
Demand for faster data services with full-coverage availability is growing continuously.
"Group-wide, we invested more than
EUR 16 billion in 2023, primarily in building and operating networks, with around EUR 4.6 billion of this figure earmarked for the
Germany operating segment alone."
This is in addition to the investments that we make in acquiring mobile spectrum.
"Hence,
the majority of the Group’s investment volume in Germany is for the build-out of broadband networks."
"This build-out is based
on the goals of our Europe-wide integrated network strategy, which we use to help achieve the EU Commission’s network build-
out targets and the Federal Government’s Digital Agenda and broadband strategy."
"The strategy is founded on the two pillars
of building out mobile and fixed networks, with the focus of the former being on 5G coverage – the most powerful technology
standard currently available."
"In the fixed network, we are focusing on rolling out our optical fiber to provide our customers with
a reliable connection at gigabit speeds."
"As well as the pure fiber-optic lines, we are also offering other innovative products: for
example, our hybrid router, which combines the transmission bandwidths of fixed-network and mobile communications, thus
attaining higher transmission speeds – particularly in rural areas."
Our goal is to ensure a clearer focus on the contributions of the segments.
"That is why we are presenting the network build-out metrics at segment level
in the combined management report."
"As a consequence, we no longer report on the number of households in Germany covered by optical fiber-based
technology."
"For further information on the corresponding metrics and the network build-out, please refer to the sections “Group strategy” and “Forecast.”
The health rate covered 98.5 % of the workforce in the reporting year."
"Five companies are not included in the health rate as they do not use a technical time
management system which allows for this kind of reporting."
This concerns 1.5 % of the workforce in Germany.

In order to improve accessibility to our digital products and services, the Board of Management decided in July 2022 to
integrate the Design for All approach into product development."
"In the reporting year, we then developed the Design for All
guide together with the segments and published it internally."
"We want to use this guide to avoid marginalization, stigmatization,
and discrimination at an early stage in the product development process and include everyone in the digital transformation."
"It
was very important to us to ensure that various diversity dimensions are covered by the guide."
We will publish detailed information on this in our 2023 CR Report.
"In general, we want to make our network infrastructure and our products as efficient, environmentally friendly, and harmless
to health as possible."
That is why we are committed to addressing the topic of mobile communications and health responsibly.
"In the context of the 5G build-out, there is public debate around the potential effects of 5G on health."
"We have been providing
information on the scientific evidence regarding mobile communications and health for more than 20 years now."
"In
June 2023, the four mobile carriers operating in Germany made a new self-commitment to the Federal Government."
"Among
other steps, they commit themselves to continue operating the joint information platform www.informationszentrum-
mobilfunk.de."
"This platform provides expert, evidence-based information on mobile communications topics subject to
controversial public debate, such as health, research, technology, benefits, and applications."
"Since 2022, the platform has been
cooperating with the Federal Government’s communication initiative “Deutschland spricht über 5G” (Germany is talking about
5G), for example, by supporting initiatives to establish a dialog with citizens."
"In the reporting year, we updated our Group-wide
EMF Policy (EMF being short for “electro-magnetic fields”) dating back to 2004."
"The EMF Policy defines standard requirements
– which considerably exceed the applicable national legal requirements – for addressing mobile communications and health-
related matters."
"For further information, please refer to the section “Risk and opportunity management.”
Responsibility for shaping the digital transformation has to be assumed by society as a whole."
"Our Board of Management plays
an active role in this discussion, which entails looking at matters such as how we can use artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly."
AI is a feature of an ever-growing number of ICT products and services that often goes unnoticed.
"It opens up opportunities, but
also presents challenges."
"Back in 2018, under the auspices of Compliance Management, we were one of the first companies
worldwide to adopt Digital Ethics Guidelines on AI."
"These guidelines provide a framework for a responsible approach to
AI."
"To supplement them, in 2021 we worked with experts to draw up professional ethics guidelines for all developers and
product managers working with AI."
"The guidelines provide best practices, methods, and tips for transferring the Digital Ethics
Guidelines on AI to application in development processes."
"We founded the Digital Ethics interdisciplinary working group in 2022 that addresses the development, monitoring, and
implementation of digital ethics, further anchoring the topic within the Group."
"The working group is also preparing the
implementation of the planned EU AI Act."
"To ensure that AI is developed that complies with our high ethical requirements in the
supply chain, too, our Supplier Code of Conduct has since early 2020 included relevant content from our AI Guidelines."
"In January 2023, we established the ChatGPT/GenAI expert group as part of the Digital Ethics working group to consider
the emergence of generative AI such as ChatGPT and its impacts."
"In February 2023, this group published a Group-wide
framework of action for employees providing guidance for the use of the free trial version of ChatGPT."
"Initially, the mission
of the expert group was to support our functional units in assessing the ethical and legal requirements for the integration of
generative AI into our business."
"The expert group now meets to identify cross-divisional synergies and integrate appropriate
solutions into existing standard processes."
"In the reporting year, we also introduced a large number of training offerings on
the potential, functioning, and risks of generative AI."
"In September 2023, we organized the first Prompt-A-Thon on how to
use prompts – i.e., instructions or research questions to an AI system – to introduce employees to the topic of generative AI."
We at Deutsche Telekom are committed to bringing about digitalization that focuses on people and values.
"Corporate digital
responsibility (CDR) refers to efforts to manage the opportunities and risks of the digital transformation responsibly."
"The goals
of our CDR activities are twofold: to prevent negative impacts, and to help shape the digitalization process in a positive way."
"In
our Corporate Digital Responsibility framework, which we published in 2022, we set forth our perspectives on the far-reaching
subject area of digital responsibility."
We will publish detailed information on this in our 2023 CR Report.

The implementation of digital participation projects is the responsibility of the individual national companies."
"With the
“Changemaker Challenge,” T‑Mobile US is mobilizing the next generation to imagine and plan how to create positive change
in their communities."
"Teams compete across three categories: Digital Equity, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, and Sustainability."
"Project 10Million, which was launched by T‑Mobile US in 2020, aims to overcome the digital divide in education with a
commitment to offer up to 10 million disadvantaged student households with free connectivity for five years."
"Across its
education programs, including Project 10Million, T‑Mobile US has worked with parents, schools, and community organizations
to connect 5.8 million of students through the end of 2023."
"But secure,
where we provide information material for all target groups."
"Our multiple award-winning Teachtoday initiative promotes the
safe and competent use of online media by children and young people."
"A toolbox is provided by the initiative for multipliers
and teachers."
It comprises more than 140 formats that deal mainly with media literacy and democracy skills.
"The initiative
additionally publishes the interactive digital children’s magazine SCROLLER, which also provides material and background
information to be used in media literacy lessons."
"The Teachtoday Academy is a platform for people who want to expand their
knowledge and skills in various areas of digital education."
"As part of the Bitkom Digital Day in June 2023, we organized various
media literacy activities, including on the topic of AI for All, in which the risks and potential of AI were explored interactively."
"In 2023, we continued our No Hate Speech initiative – with the message “No Hate Speech – Our decision!.” For example,
the accompanying campaign ad shows what a single positive comment can achieve against hate speech."
"We also tackled
hate speech in a joint campaign with FC Bayern München."
"As part of this campaign, we showed realistic hate comments and
called for a stronger stance."
We want to encourage people to actively combat hate speech and abusive language online.
"As
in the previous year, the initiative focused on issues such as gaming and e-sports."
"In the reporting year, we worked with the
esports player foundation to develop ten principles for fair play, the FIFA Fairplay Guide."
"We reached around 865 million media
contacts in the reporting year with our No Hate Speech initiative."
"We reached 5.7 million people directly or through multipliers
such as parents and educators (e.g., in workshops) in 2023 alone (prior year: more than 4 million)."
"We have labeled the
initiative with #GoodMagenta."
We also won various awards and prizes in the reporting year for the No Hate Speech campaign.
The topic of data privacy is part and parcel of using digital media safely and securely.
"Our “Digitally secure” online guidebook
offers practical advice on how to use digital media safely and securely."
We measure the impact of our social commitment with a set of three ESG KPIs.
"The Community Contribution ESG KPI maps
our social commitment in terms of financial, human, and material resources: in 2023, it amounted to around EUR 1,504 million
(prior year: EUR 2,346 million)."
"A particular effect in 2022 was our support for Ukrainian refugees in the form of free or heavily
discounted telecommunications services (EUR 550 million in Germany)."
"We continued to offer telecommunications services at
lower-cost rates in 2023, albeit to a lesser extent (EUR 24 million in Germany)."
"The Reach – Focus Topics ESG KPI shows the
number of media contacts we have reached with our communication on our focus topics of digital society (with the subtopics
digital participation and digital values) and low-carbon society."
"This includes, for instance, the people we reached in 2023 with
advertising and content on socially relevant topics, such as online hate speech: we recorded a decrease to around 1,734 million
people compared with the prior year (2,070 million)."
"In
2023, the number of beneficiaries was around 51 million (prior year: 41 million)."

Ukrainian citizens were again eligible to receive a discounted prepaid card in 2023.
"As a gesture of solidarity with Israel, Telekom Deutschland enabled free phone calls and text messages to and from Israel and
within the country via the mobile and fixed network from October 12 to 31, 2023, including roaming for data, text messages,
and voice services in Israel."
"Following the powerful earthquakes in Syria and Turkey in spring 2023, we enabled phone calls to and from the affected
countries free of charge for three weeks in February."
"On top of this, the Group donated EUR 1 million to the “Aktion Deutschland
Hilft” relief coalition for direct disaster aid in response to the earthquake."
"And following the earthquake in Morocco, we also
enabled phone calls free of charge to and from Morocco and within the country via the Deutsche Telekom network in Germany
and at T‑Mobile US for three weeks in September 2023, and offered free roaming for data and voice services."
"T‑Mobile US also offered its customers support in 2023 so that they could stay in touch with people affected by disasters and
severe weather."
During the August 2023 wildfires on the island of Maui in the U.S.
"state of Hawaii, T‑Mobile US worked quickly
to restore network connectivity in affected areas."
"T‑Mobile US provided unlimited talk, text, and data to T‑Mobile US customers
with Maui addresses, distributed activated phones with service and charging supplies, as well as set up Starlink Wi-Fi hotspots
to support, e.g., residents, evacuees, and first responders, with high-speed internet."
"Also, the company raised donations from
employees and customers through matching, text to give, and other programs."
"Data privacy and data security
People will use ICT solutions if they trust that their personal data will be kept secure."
"These solutions can then also unleash their
potential for more sustainable development."
"As a result, we attach particularly great importance to protecting and securing
data."
"For further information, please refer to the section “Risk and opportunity management.”
Our active data privacy and compliance culture, which has been built up over many years, sets national and international
standards."
"The data privacy management system outlines the measures, processes, and audits we use to ensure compliance
with laws, regulations, and self-commitments to uphold data privacy in the Group."
"Since 2009, the Group Board of
Management has been advised by an independent Data Privacy Advisory Board comprising reputable experts from politics, the
research community, business, and independent organizations."
"Through our global data privacy organization, we are continually pursuing the objective of a transparent, high level of data
protection in all of the Group companies."

The Group Security Policy contains significant security-related principles valid within the Group, which are based on the
international ISO 27001 standard."
"Similar to the data privacy organization, the Group has established a global security
organization which operates both on a centralized basis and in all Group entities."
"These elements lay the foundation for ensuring
an adequate and consistent level of security within our entire Group."
"We issue an annual transparency report – since 2014 in Germany, and since 2016 in our other national companies in Europe –
in which we set out the nature and scope of our disclosures to security authorities."
"We are thus fulfilling our statutory duty as a
telecommunications company."
"In order to ensure even better data privacy and data security within our Group, audits and certifications are carried out
regularly by internal and external experts."
"This includes the annual (re-)certification of the Telekom Security Management in
accordance with ISO 27001, regular Group-wide internal security checks, and the annual review of the individual Group units in
connection with security maturity reporting."
"These audits help us assess the status quo of security in our Group and respond to
requirements at Group or entity level at an early stage."
"Every two years, we perform a sample survey of data privacy and data security awareness across the Company."
"In the course
of the Group Data Privacy Audit (GDPA), we survey around 21,000 Deutsche Telekom employees (excluding T‑Mobile US) on
topics related to data privacy and data security."
"Of the employees invited to take part in 2022, around 16,000 responded."
"The
data protection level in the units is determined on a scale of 0 to 100 % on the basis of employees’ answers regarding their
thoughts, actions, and knowledge around data privacy."
"The resulting Data Protection Award indicator was calculated most
recently in 2022 at 88 % (2020: 86 %)."
We use our Online Awareness Survey (OAS) as a tool for collecting indicators on security awareness within the Company.
"Some
43,700 employees (excluding T‑Mobile US) across all levels of the hierarchy were invited to take part in the survey in 2023."
Around a third responded.
"With academic support, we use the results from this survey to determine the Security Awareness
Index (SAI)."
"In 2023, the index was 80.6 (2021: 80.9) of a maximum of 100 points, higher than in any other company in the
benchmark."
"We also have our processes and management systems as well as products and services certified by external,
independent organizations such as TÜV, DQS, DEKRA, and auditing firms."
"Telecommunications companies are required to train their employees on issues related to data protection law when they
begin their employment."
"Deutsche Telekom goes above and beyond these legal requirements: Every two years, we train all
of our employees in Germany and place them under an obligation to uphold data privacy and telecommunications secrecy."
Corresponding requirements apply to our international subsidiaries.
"Where there is a greater risk of data such as customer
or employee information being misused, we also offer additional online training designed for self-study, give data privacy
presentations, and host classroom training courses on specialized topics such as protection of customer data."
We react to new emerging threats and continuously develop innovative processes for defending against attacks.
"And for good
reason: cyberattacks on companies are becoming more aggressive and sophisticated across all industries."
"In the reporting
period alone, we registered on average almost 50 million attacks per day on our honeypot systems (prior year: 54 million)."
"At
its peak, the number of attacks per day reached up to 95.6 million."
"Of course, not all of the attacks picked up by our sensors
are high-level."
Most are automatic scanning processes to detect potential vulnerabilities.
"While these do not necessarily count
as fully fledged attacks, they are still to be seen as relevant early-stage activities."
"Deutsche Telekom Security even develops
its own malware in a shielded environment and uses it to test whether new systems can reliably detect and mitigate these
attack vectors."
In this way we ensure our own critical IT infrastructure is protected.
"We also offer other operators of critical
infrastructure advisory services, for example energy providers."
Our security experts use their experience to help develop security solutions.
"Deutsche Telekom Security’s portfolio was
systematically refined in 2023."
"In light of the ever-increasing number of complex threat scenarios, the focus was on the
continued automation and standardization of solutions."
"This enables our customers to react even faster if they are attacked
using Managed Detection and Response (MDR) and to stop processes in time if necessary."
"Our SASE (Secure Access Service
Edge) solutions offer our customers comprehensive cloud-based protection so that they can work securely wherever they are."
Data privacy and security play a fundamental role in the development of our products and services.
"We review the security of
our systems at every step of development using the Privacy and Security Assessment process for new and existing systems
when the technology or method of data processing is modified."
"We use a standardized procedure to also document the data
privacy and data security status of our products throughout their entire life cycle."
"Our security management systems are
certified externally."
"At the same time, we ensure that our services also comply with specific regulatory requirements from other
industries, such as TISAX®, an established standard in the automotive industry."

Youth protection aspects are also taken into consideration in our product and service design."
"When we develop services
that could be relevant in terms of youth protection in Germany, we consult our Youth Protection Officer for suggestions of
restrictions or changes."
"In 2014, we appointed a Child Safety Officer (CSO) in each of our national companies in Europe."
"The
CSO acts as a central contact for the relevant stakeholders of the community, and plays a key internal role in coordinating
issues relevant to youth protection."
"Since protecting minors when they interact with media is a challenge across many different
industries, we cooperate with different youth protection organizations that aim to make the internet a safer place for children
and young people."
"We work with research institutes, industry partners, initiatives, standardization bodies, public institutions, and other internet
and telecommunications service providers worldwide with a view to fighting cybercrime and enhancing internet security
together."
"For instance, we collaborate with the German Federal Office for Cybersecurity throughout Germany, and with the
European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) at EU level."
"We have also been involved in other national and international
organizations for many years, such as the Federation of German Industries, Bitkom, and the Munich Security Conference."
"The
Cyber Security Cluster Bonn is an association of authorities and companies in Bonn that are dedicated to consulting, education,
and research in the field of cybersecurity."
"As an expert committee, the Cyber Security Cluster Bonn offers direct advice to
German and European government bodies."
"Aspect 4: Respecting human rights
There are still places in the world where human rights are not a given."
"As a responsible, globally active company, we take
internationally recognized human rights and environmental concerns seriously and acknowledge our corporate responsibility."
"This not only applies within the Company, because we also take our responsibility to and with our business partners and our
more than 20,000 direct suppliers in more than 150 countries seriously."
"In our Code of Human Rights, we spell out in detail our commitment to respecting and promoting human rights and
environmental concerns everywhere we operate – including our suppliers and business partners."
"We take into account the legal
requirements when developing the Code of Human Rights."
"It was expanded in the reporting year by incorporating the content
of the existing Employee Relations Policy, among other aspects."
"In addition to this self-commitment, we also recognize the minimum
social safeguards which, in line with the provisions of the EU Taxonomy, are necessary conditions for the taxonomy alignment of
economic activities."
"The principles and expectations described in the Code are aimed in equal measure at our employees and
at our suppliers and business partners."
All Group companies in Deutsche Telekom AG’s business area have implemented the Code of Human Rights.
"We revised the
Code of Human Rights in the reporting year so as to better reflect, for example, legal requirements such as the German Act
on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG)."
"Together with the annual report on
the results of the risk analyses, the Code of Human Rights forms our human rights policy statement within the meaning of the
LkSG."
"The revised Code of Human Rights was adopted by the Group Board of Management in 2023 and subsequently published;
adoption of the revised Code by the management bodies of the Group companies included began in 2023."
"Due diligence processes in the Group
We reviewed and enhanced our human rights and environmental due diligence processes in 2022 and 2023 to better reflect
the new statutory requirements among other factors, e.g., under the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act."
"We could be exposed to
country- and supplier-specific risks in particular because of our global procurement activities."
"For further information, please refer to the section “Risk and opportunity management.”
The Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG and the management of the individual Group companies are responsible
for implementation of and compliance with our due diligence processes."
"Periodic and/or event-driven internal reporting on
human rights and environmental results in decision-making bodies (e.g., management bodies) is designed to ensure that
informed decisions can always be made."
We will publish detailed information on the results of the annual risk analysis in our 2023 CR Report and in our 2023 LkSG Report.

In order to implement our self-commitments and the legal requirements, we have introduced a comprehensive program for
minimizing risks, which we are constantly updating."
"The core elements of the program are regular risk analyses in our own
business area and at our suppliers’; a policy statement on human rights; awareness-raising among employees, suppliers,
and business partners; a mechanism for lodging complaints; and reporting."
"We derive appropriate preventive and remedial
measures from the results of the annual and event-driven risk analyses."
We also perform verification and effectiveness audits.
"Examples of these include on-site auditing measures at our own Group companies in our own area of business or at suppliers,
e.g., in the form of human rights impact assessments (HRIAs)/social audits, as well as certification in the area of occupational
health and safety."
The focus here is on respecting human rights in relation to working conditions.
"These systematic and
comprehensive audits give us a deeper insight into the actual conditions on site, enable us to respond even more specifically
on an event-driven basis and to develop and implement solution concepts in partnership with all parties involved."
"Based on
the analysis results from 2023, we will examine whether, and to what extent, such on-site audits are necessary in 2024."
"There
were no grounds for risk-related on-site audits in our own business area in the reporting year."
"We performed extensive auditing
measures at our suppliers."
"For further information, please refer to the section “Labor standards at our suppliers.”
As a U.S.-listed company, T‑Mobile US conducts a risk assessment using its own methodology, on which it regularly reports
to the relevant bodies, which also include representatives of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"Before T‑Mobile US selects suppliers, a
centralized Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) process screens for anti-corruption, global sanctions, and human rights
violations, as well as financial, security, reputational, and environmental risks."
"Supplier risk assessments are performed on an
ongoing basis depending on the risk profile of the supplier."
"Via the TellMe whistleblower and complaints portal, employees and external third parties can submit information and report
complaints – anonymously, if needed."
"A total of five reports and complaints relating to human rights or environmental law were
received via TellMe in the reporting year."
"In particular, risks relating to civil engineering work for the rollout of optical fiber were
derived from the complaints and tip-offs received and factored into the annual risk analysis."
"Labor standards at our suppliers
Our perception of ourselves as a company that acts in a socially and ecologically sustainable way includes assuming
responsibility along our entire value chain."
"We have been working to improve sustainability throughout our supply chain
for many years."
"We have anchored the topic of sustainability and the resulting requirements in all procurement processes
(excluding T‑Mobile US)."
Procurement is responsible for implementation.
"Group Corporate Responsibility works with the
procurement function to strategically enhance sustainability in procurement."
"Our sustainability principles and their application in procurement are set out in the Procurement Practices in the Global
Procurement Policy."
"In addition, there is a policy giving purchasing officers an overview of the CSR criteria that are to be taken
into account at each stage of the procurement process."
"In the reporting year, we rolled out various sustainability materials and
training courses to our employees in the context of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act."
We will publish detailed information on activities relating to implementation of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act in our 2023 CR Report.
We require our suppliers to accept the principles of our Supplier Code of Conduct and meet the associated requirements.
"To minimize any risks relating to sustainability shortcomings and support suppliers in further developing their sustainability
performance, we use a comprehensive risk management system for suppliers."
"We start by performing a risk assessment of
all product groups."
We then carry out a comprehensive risk analysis for all suppliers in every category.
"Specialized companies
assess our suppliers with regard to financial, CSR, and compliance risks (excluding T‑Mobile US)."
"We also generally apply a
20 % weighting to environmental objectives, our suppliers’ carbon footprint, and, in the case of individual product groups, other
criteria, such as social sustainability."
"In this way, we discover if there is any increased risk in terms of specific sustainability
aspects at any of our suppliers."
"To our shareholders

Sustainability assessments and reviews are additionally conducted for selected suppliers of product groups in high-risk
categories."
"Depending on their individual sustainability performance and risk classification, we use a range of instruments,
for instance, sustainability ratings by external providers, mobile employee surveys, and on-site supplier audits (social audits)."
"Our focus here is not only on our direct suppliers but also, to the extent possible, on downstream suppliers."
"We enhance the
effectiveness of our audits through our cooperation with the Joint Alliance for CSR industry initiative (JAC, formerly Joint Audit
Cooperation), which comprises 27 globally active telecommunications companies."
"In 2023, we carried out a total of 150 audits
(prior year: 98) – 137 social audits (prior year: 83) and 13 mobile surveys (prior year: 15) – of which 62 (prior year: 40) at our
direct and 88 (prior year: 58) at our indirect suppliers."
"Since 2010, we have carried out 1,060 audits (prior year: 910) within the
framework of the JAC."
We work closely with selected suppliers to steadily improve their sustainability performance.
The program is currently being refined in the JAC.
"We hosted the
JAC General Assembly in the reporting year and participated in an industry dialog with other telecommunications companies."
"Issues discussed in the dialog included the further development of auditing requirements, improvements in transparency, and
the effective identification of measures for telecommunications-specific industry risks."
"One outcome of this dialog was the
establishment of dedicated working groups, in which Deutsche Telekom will participate in 2024."
"It also includes suppliers for whom irregularities were identified, but where corresponding corrective action was
taken."
The share of this procurement volume subjected to a risk assessment amounted to 99.98 % in 2023 (prior year: 99.6 %).
"The Procurement Volume Verified as Non-Critical ESG KPI – target for 2025: 60 % – by contrast, measures the share accounted
for by suppliers checked for social and ecological criteria by means of dedicated reviews – e.g., through EcoVadis, the CDP,
social audits, or supplier visits."
"In 2023, the share of these CR-verified suppliers was 66.17 % (prior year: 64.1 %)."
"In each case,
the calculation is based on the Group-wide procurement volume that is already uniformly mapped to a large extent (excluding
the Network Capacity category and T‑Mobile US), but on different levels of supplier relationships."
"Aspect 5: Fighting corruption
Corruption violates national and international law."
"We take a clear stance against any form of corruption in the public and
private sector, whether this is active corruption in the form of bribery, or passive corruption in the form of bribe-taking."
"For this
reason, our compliance management system (CMS) is particularly geared towards preventing corruption."
"Compliance management system
Our compliance culture is a key component for corporate governance based on integrity and respect."
"We have expressed
our Group-wide commitment to complying with ethical principles and both legal and statutory requirements."
"We have
incorporated this pledge in our Guiding Principles and our Code of Conduct."
"We implemented a CMS with the aim of minimizing risks arising from systematic infringements of legal or ethical standards
that could result in regulatory or criminal liability on the part of the Company, its executive body members, or employees, or
result in a significant loss of reputation."
"The Board of Management considers its overall responsibility for compliance as a key
leadership task."
Our Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for the design and management of the CMS.
"Compliance officers
implement the CMS and our compliance goals locally at the level of our operating segments and national companies."
"Our CMS is based on the Compliance Risk Assessment (CRA), which we use to identify and assess compliance risks and
introduce appropriate preventative measures."
"To this end, we have introduced a process to be carried out at regular intervals."
"The companies that take part in the CRA are selected using a risk-based approach according to the level of maturity of their
compliance management system (maturity-based model)."
The CRA methodology was adjusted in the reporting year and a focus CRA carried out.
"The focus CRA is a further evolution
of the existing CRA approach."
"Under the new approach, the goal is to assess the effectiveness of the control environment in
selected compliance risk areas."
"We piloted this approach in 2023, with the main focus being on our procurement processes."
"Ten international companies (the Europe and Systems Solutions operating segments) and one national company (Germany
operating segment) participated in this focus CRA pilot project."
"The companies were selected according to risk, with a
focus on international companies with their own procurement organization."
"Each of the Group companies was responsible for
performing its own CRA."
"The central compliance organization managed the overall process, providing support and advice at all
stages."
"Going forward, these focus CRAs will be alternated with the broader-based standard risk assessments using the existing
methodology."
"The total value is calculated using actual data from January 1, 2023 to November 30, 2023 and an estimate for December 2023 based on the prior-year
figures, since the data for December 2023 was not available at the time of publication."

"114
As a U.S.-listed company, T‑Mobile US conducts a risk assessment using its own methodology, on which it regularly reports to
the relevant bodies, which also include representatives of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"We regularly engage external auditors to audit our compliance management system in accordance with Auditing Standard 980
laid down by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V."
"– IDW) focusing
on the fight against corruption."
"A total of 22 domestic and international companies were therefore successfully audited in the
2020 and 2021 financial years and the effectiveness of their respective CMS verified."
"Alongside compliance processes, the
audits focused in particular on processes that are exposed to an increased risk of corruption, for example, in procurement,
sales, events, donations, sponsorships, mergers and acquisitions, and human resources."
"A further IDW AuS 980 audit of
Deutsche Telekom AG and of selected Group companies is planned for the 2024 and 2025 financial years."
We regularly provide risk-oriented and target group-specific compliance and anti-corruption training.
"We rolled out an
e-learning course on the fundamentals of compliance, including the fight against corruption, for all Group employees nationally
and internationally (excluding T‑Mobile US) in the reporting year; it is available in 14 languages."
"Employees can also obtain
advice on compliance matters and on conduct based on our values and in line with the law on the AskMe advice portal."
"Despite all precautions, we are not always able to prevent breaches of law or violations of regulations at the Company."
"Our TellMe whistleblower portal enables employees and external third parties to report potential breaches of compliance
to the Compliance unit fully confidentially and, if needed, anonymously."
"We systematically investigate all tip-offs to the
extent allowed by law – including those that reach us through other channels."
"We take actions against misconduct that are
appropriate to the facts and degree of fault in line with the relevant laws and regulations."
"We have introduced a Group-wide
reporting process to control and monitor these activities."
"In 2023, 85 compliance-related tip-offs were submitted via the TellMe
portal (prior year: 81 tip-offs)."
"Over the course of the year, 29 of these were confirmed to be cases of misconduct and dealt with
accordingly."
"With our Supplier Code of Conduct as an integral component of our General Terms and Conditions for Purchasing, we obligate
our suppliers to, among other requirements, refrain from any kind of corruption or conduct that could be interpreted as such."
"We select our business partners based on compliance criteria and, where required, conduct risk-oriented integrity checks
and/or compliance business assessments."
We have also been offering e-learning on compliance to our suppliers since 2014.
We will publish detailed information on our Supplier Code of Conduct in our 2023 CR Report.
"Employees
Supporting people."
"We at Deutsche Telekom are actively shaping the digitalization of society and, at the same time, we are engaged in the cultural
and digital transformation."
"In many areas, environmental effects, new technologies, and business models entail fundamental
changes to our working world and the skills we require for it."
"Our aspiration is to steer this transformation process and, in
doing so, shift the focus of attention to people."
"As HR, our vision is to create the Best Team in the Industry."
"On the one hand,
this requires us to safeguard the competitiveness of our organization, further enhance our attractiveness as an employer,
and create a working environment capable of responding dynamically to changes in how we work today."
"On the other, it
means establishing powerful HR IT systems with which we can become even more efficient and agile."
"We continue to focus on
strengthening a culture of diversity and participation in which all employees have the opportunity to unlock their full potential."
"Above and beyond this, we place a particular emphasis company-wide on building and extending
urgently needed technical and digital skills to systematically shape up our company in readiness for the challenges that lie
ahead."
Our people strategy is thus central to the implementation of our Group strategy to become the Leading Digital Telco.
"We bundle
our programs and initiatives into five strategic priorities, which we further refined in the reporting year and present in the
following for illustrative purposes."

Our HR work based on the priorities
1."
"Future-proof organization
Our ambition for a future-proof organization is to build competitive structures which serve both our corporate targets and our
workforce."
"That means aligning employment conditions with the market while systematically tapping efficiency potential by
improving the quality of our products and services, and by automating and digitalizing processes in a targeted way."
"At the
same time, we are taking steps in all areas to permanently adapt our structures, processes, and ways of working to changing
market conditions."
"It is our responsibility to place employees with the right skills in the right jobs and continue to support their
development in line with future needs."
Transformation initiatives.
"Over the course of the reporting year, we once again implemented essential transformation
programs in the Group’s business areas, e.g., at Group Headquarters, within Telekom Deutschland’s business customer
segment, as well as at Deutsche Telekom IT, the Group’s internal IT service provider."
"Care is always taken to implement all
restructuring activities in a socially responsible manner."
"In August 2023, T‑Mobile US shared its plans to make organizational
shifts, including reducing some corporate, back-office, and technology roles."
"These shifts impacted close to 5,000 positions, a
little under 7 % of our total employees."
"Impacted roles were primarily duplicative to other roles or were aligned to systems or
processes that are changing or did not fit with the current company priorities."
"In September 2023, these shifts were completed."
"In addition to severance payments based on tenure, impacted employees were given 60 days minimum of transition leave,
during which time they remain part of our company headcount."
"Impacted employees were also offered a lifetime T‑Mobile
discount for service, up to 2 years of access to tuition assistance, and for long time employees (20 years+) an enhanced tuition
payment."
"The Group continued its efforts in the reporting year to build towards modern, fit-for-purpose organizational models, such
as agile or flexible organizational structures to meet the different needs of business."
"In Germany, for instance, global
organizational structures and agile workflows in the T‑Systems corporate customer segment were continually refined, and an
IT solution was piloted to transparently map agile working structures."
"A number of our national companies in Europe, too,
including Magyar Telekom in Hungary, Slovak Telekom, and T‑Mobile Polska, have already implemented agile working across
broad swaths of the organization."
"We thus not only promote sustainably customer-oriented and agile working methods, but are
also able to respond quickly to change."
New employment prospects.
"Since the start of 2022, the next.JOB unit has been offering employees in Germany who are
seeking a new professional challenge outside of the Group opportunities to enter the public sector."
"The placement service
is available to both civil servants and non-civil servants and coordinates closely with the Group segments."
"In 2023, next.JOB
significantly expanded its collaboration with Digitalization HEROES, an initiative of Deutsche Telekom IT (DT IT)."
"The initiative
offers employment prospects in the public or private sectors to DT IT employees whose skills are falling out of demand or are
no longer needed at Deutsche Telekom due to the technological transition, but which are sought after outside of the Company."
"Together, next.JOB and Digitalization HEROES have organized numerous events and info calls for interested employees."
"In
2023, next.JOB enabled 276 successful permanent placements, many of which were with the German Federal Employment
Agency."
"As a founding member of the initiative Allianz der Chancen, we are actively shaping the transformation of the working world."
"Member organizations of the alliance offer their employees economically and socially sustainable employment prospects
across many different industries."
"The aim is to make people aware of new opportunities and lower the threshold for change:
from one job to another."
"To this end, in 2023 the relevant companies rolled out numerous internal projects and also formulated
common areas of operation and recommendations for action for a new working world."
"Top tech and digital skills
According to a Korn Ferry Institute study, there will be 4.3 million vacant technical positions in the technology, media, and
telecommunications industries by 2030."
"Yet we need highly skilled employees, many of whom with technical, digital, and IT
profiles, to help us achieve our Group strategy."
"In times of shortages of skilled labor, this not only puts us in direct competition
with our industry peers, but in particular with tech and software companies, as well as the automotive sector, all of which have
a strong demand for technical and digital skills."
"We respond to this challenge by ramping up our investments in recruiting,
developing, and retaining talents with the requisite skills."
"In the reporting year we increased the percentage of digital experts
within our workforce at the Group to 22 %, up from 19.7 % in the prior year."
"Thereby, we have already significantly exceeded our
promise we made to the capital markets of reaching 17 % by 2024."

Romania, Czech Republic, and Hungary)."
"We deploy a broad spectrum of HR marketing measures oriented to specific target groups with the goal of filling vacancies
with the ideal candidates as rapidly as possible."
"University partnerships and cooperation with strategic partners have been
bundled under the Magenta Campus team with the aim of connecting with students directly."
"This team has initiated target
group-specific measures at selected universities in Germany, and is set to scale up the campus portfolio throughout Europe."
"A Magenta Campus tour designed to strengthen our on-campus contact was held at seven locations, generating over
2,400 contacts and more than 150 recommendations for the Telekom Talent Pool."
"We also remain committed to existing
partnerships, including with Femtec, with the goal of attracting women into STEM professions at Deutsche Telekom."
"A strong employer brand pays off: in the reporting year, Deutsche Telekom once again won the Institute of Research & Data
Aggregation’s Leading Employer Award."
"Our efforts to tailor our communication to specific target audiences are also bearing
fruit: we were ranked #1 in Potentialpark’s Social Media Communication 2023 and Talent Communication studies, and took
the top spot in the NetFed HR Benchmark."
"In the reporting year, despite the challenging situation on the global labor market, we attracted 10,725 new
employees (excluding T‑Mobile US)."
"Germany accounted for the largest share of these new hires, with 2,472 new team
members."
"A sizable portion, namely 797 new technicians and 1,174 experts, were recruited for the fiber-optic build-out in
Germany."
"A further 1,168 new employees were hired in India, primarily with the job profiles software developer, tester, technical
product manager, and project management, making India one of the most important locations for attracting tech and digital
talents."
"We also welcomed 1,916 new apprentices and dual students, a high percentage of whom with technical, digital, and IT
profiles."
"For further information on training at Deutsche Telekom, please refer to the section “Investing in young talents.”
T‑Mobile US also made significant advances in recruitment and retention over the course of the reporting year."
"The company invested in programs intended to enable different routes to employment, since people
often choose to press pause on their careers due to important life events or professional shifts."
"The Returnship program allows
them to hit the start button again."
"Participants are provided with a dedicated career development and support system in order
to build specific skills, take advantage of coaching and mentoring opportunities, and put together their own résumé over the
course of the six-month program."
Our comprehensive recruitment strategy unites digitalization with personal commitment.
"We highly value direct exchange, so
we attend careers fairs, networking sessions, and other events."
"Personal contact plays a key role, and we reward the successful
recommendation by employees through our ExpertsHireExperts program with a EUR 2,500 bonus."
"This approach resulted in
788 new employees in 2023."
"We also rely on innovative recruitment measures such as events in the metaverse, and make
use of artificial intelligence (AI)."
"Our sourcing team placed 348 potential candidates onto the recruitment pathway using tools
such as the AI-powered recruiting platform Eightfold."
"Assessment centers are integral to our recruitment strategy and serve
as a powerful tool for selecting skilled employees and leaders."
"We also offer our employees seamless onboarding through our
dedicated onboarding app (6,451 users in 2023), alongside innovative onboarding events, where we welcomed 772 people."

Investing in young talents.
Investing in our own young employees is key to safeguarding the skills we need as a company.
"We
welcomed 1,916 new apprentices and dual students in Germany, a high percentage of whom with technical and IT profiles."
"We believe the key to attracting the younger generation is to understand what they want and need from their work, and
systematically act in alignment with this."
"To this end, we worked with leading social and educational research scientist Prof.
Klaus Hurrelmann and the FiBS Research Institute for the Economics of Education and Social Affairs to survey all young
professionals at Deutsche Telekom."
"Our representative study, Be A Future Maker, gives us valuable insights into what Gen

plenty of scope for trainees to develop in their own direction and flexibly shape their own learning path."
"As part of an elective
focus subject – including public and regulatory affairs, technology and innovation, Group Development/M&A, finance, in-house
consulting, Human Resources, and more – our trainees go through five core phases."
"An intensive onboarding bootcamp is
followed by various project assignments, work with customers, exploratory work in new business areas, and a project phase at
one of our national companies."
"Trainees are encouraged to grow and develop continually through access to a variety of modern
learning formats."
"Their professional and intercultural skills are nurtured in domestic and international projects and experiences
abroad."
"In 2023, we placed 56 % of program graduates in positions in the future-relevant fields of technology and digitalization."
"Investing in young talents is also of particular importance for our Europe operating segment, and remains a key priority in
our commitment to promoting growth and innovation."

company."
"T‑Systems is a founding partner to “42 Berlin,” a coding academy that opened in Berlin in early December 2022."

ignored; everyone gets a chance to start programming."

pinpoint where personal skills are present or lacking, and development plans are continuously adapted by means of tailored
training programs."

"The
central HR instruments thus form the basis Group-wide for comprehensive training tailored to specific business requirements."
The majority of our employees’ development takes place in the respective segments of Deutsche Telekom.
"Targeted skilling
initiatives in these areas in the reporting year resulted in 8,600 new- and upskilling measures, such as in academies run by our
Technology and Innovation Board of Management department, or in the Systems Solutions and Germany operating segments."

our long-term success."

changing needs of customers and employees."

us to reflect on our behavior on a daily basis and helping us to make the right decisions."

Diversity, equity, and inclusion."
"Fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion is an integral part of who we
are and how we see ourselves."
"We support the different diversity dimensions such as age, national and ethnic origin, gender and
gender identity, physical and mental abilities, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation, or social background."
"We firmly believe
that this also increases our corporate success, because we consider diverse teams to be a driver of innovation."
"In respect of
gender diversity, our goal of increasing the percentage of women in management positions to 30 % across the Group (excluding
T‑Mobile US) by 2025 still applies."
"With women occupying 45 % (December 31, 2022: 50 %) of positions on the Supervisory
Board and 37.5 % (December 31, 2022: 37.5 %) of positions on the Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG at the end
of 2023, we have already exceeded this target in these boards."
"Across the Group (including T‑Mobile US), the proportion of
women in middle and upper management stood at 27.9 % at the end of 2023 (December 31, 2022: 28.1 %)."
"To ensure we
reach our target in these management levels, we have worked with the different business segments to draw up concrete
implementation plans."
"Specific measures are to be agreed aimed at increasing diversity in management teams depending
on the situation in the respective segment, to be discussed by management on a regular basis."
"These measures are also
particularly relevant in the context of our succession planning and recruitment activities."
"We strive to achieve balanced, diverse
management teams, especially in respect of age, gender, and (inter)national origin."
"T‑Mobile US, too, strives to safeguard and further build on the diversity within its workforce in respect of gender, age, and
national origin."
"As part of its Equity in Action approach, T‑Mobile US continues to extend its employee reach and development
programs targeting women and under-represented talent."
"This approach supports the inclusive values inherent in T‑Mobile US’
culture and creates a company environment of belonging."
"T‑Mobile US has launched customized diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DE&I) strategic plans for business functions that are aligned to the pillars of Equity in Action – talent, culture, brand, and
digital equity."
"The DE&I strategic plans for the business functions include objectives, key results, measurements, and tactics
to help close potential gaps."
"T‑Mobile US’ success measures include diverse talent slates (applicants, interviews, and hires),
participation in development programs, internal career movement, employee engagement, supplier diversity, and investments
in the community through Volun‑T Grants and Project 10Million."
"With Lead Magenta Next, T‑Mobile US has also initiated a program aimed at putting
under-represented talent at the intersection of sponsorship, readiness, and opportunity."
"It is designed to help develop under-
represented talents and strengthen diversity at leadership level."
"T‑Mobile US also offers the McKinsey Executive Leadership
program to support ethnic minorities, focusing on the development of executive leadership capabilities, while driving
transformative personal and professional growth."

supporting numerous employee networks which aim to celebrate the employees’ diversity and backgrounds."
"Germany, too, has many employee networks."
"Since 2023, these networks have been addressing all seven diversity dimensions."
"Our commitment is further underscored by international and segment-specific initiatives, such as our women’s networks in the
countries and segments."
"In 2023, the latter came together for a first-ever joint global network meeting."
We employ numerous measures and products to create an inclusive workplace for all.
"In 2021, we implemented a revised Group
Policy on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion internationally."
"We developed this further in 2022 by way of our Group Inclusion
Agreement and the Action Plan 2.0, and thereby laid the foundation for a shared framework of values, which continues to apply
for all employees."
"In this way, we help to support and safeguard compliance with our diversity values in all decision-making
activities and actions at all Group levels."

We raise employee awareness through training courses on topics such as unconscious bias, anti-racism, and gender diversity."
"Additionally, we worked with our employees in the reporting year to develop and pilot accessible e-learning to deliver a basic
understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion."
Global rollout in ten languages is planned for 2024.
"We sent a further signal
of our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion with the publication of the Transgender Handbook in 2022, which was
available to all employees in the reporting year."
"It aims not only to increase transgender visibility and awareness, but also to
offer practical support."
"We are also taking action to improve inclusion in the workplace, for instance, by establishing gender-
neutral restrooms, quiet zones, and prayer rooms, and by incorporating inclusion into our IT systems."
"Since 2022, we have included questions on employees’ perception of equal opportunities and inclusion in our employee
survey with the goal of making the effectiveness of our measures transparent and traceable."
"In the last survey from
November 2023, the value for No Discrimination was 91 % and for Equal Opportunities 86 %."
"In the reporting year, we

workplace, and to collaborate even better across units and borders."
"At the same time, we continue to invest in transforming
our offices into places of encounter, identification, and innovation."
"We took another step towards greater workplace flexibility
with the Group works agreement on Magenta Office, which was signed in October 2023."
"The booking zones within the office
buildings have been removed, and a large portion of our office spaces converted into shared spaces."
"Employees can now book
workplaces and rooms via a standardized booking tool available to everyone."
"And with all Magenta Office buildings in Germany
gradually being made available to employees, they will be able to work remotely at an office close to their home."
"Employees
additionally have the option to work from other European countries for up to 20 working days a year."
"Our engagement score, which is our measure of employee satisfaction, is
calculated from the data collected by the employee survey, which as of late is conducted every two years, and the pulse surveys
(both excluding T‑Mobile US)."
"The employee survey was not carried out in the reporting year on account of a change in service
provider, and has instead been rescheduled for 2024."
"The pulse survey is carried out twice a year, or once a year in years when
the employee survey is carried out."
"The most recent pulse survey from November 2023 returned a high engagement score
of 76 points (2022: 78 points)."
"The question on Mood
or Satisfaction remains at the high level of 78 % (2022: 81 %) and is above comparable benchmarks."
"To allow for qualitative
answers, the survey included a free-text box in which employees could suggest things that would reinforce their commitment
to their work."
"Three further free-text boxes were added in 2023 which employees can use to give feedback on the topics of
Career Development, Culture of Trust, and Team Attractiveness."
"We continue to pursue a range of initiatives to further increase
employee satisfaction."

engagement and the prevailing corporate culture."

"Since 2023, following the end of the coronavirus pandemic,
our employees began returning in greater numbers to the office, while continuing to work partly remotely."
"In response to the
greater flexibility of our employees in the face of changed conditions, we made changes that included adapting the fire safety
assistant concept, and developed and introduced an app for our employees to call first aiders."
"We won a business award for
this app: the German Stevie Award."
"The advisory service set up in 2022 for international
employees affected by the war in Ukraine was expanded in 2023 to include, for example, support for employees or their

Our portfolio also includes courses on nutrition, exercise, and relaxation (stress prevention, mindfulness) to support employees’
mental and physical well-being."

transformation, and leadership, including action to promote emotional intelligence."

mindfulness habits and emotional intelligence skills, with the goal of improving commitment."
"We also use mini-interventions as
organizational development techniques designed to have a positive impact on the workday."
"The One Minute to Arrive initiative
won the Merits Award."
"On an international level, for example, our OTE group in Greece received ten awards relating to health,
safety, and well-being."
"These included accolades for its health and safety culture in the workplace, and the development of
individual measures to improve employees’ physical and mental health and well-being."
"Awards were also received for initiatives
on health and well-being, behavioral risks, and crisis management."
"In July 2021, T‑Mobile US was the first mobile provider to receive the WELL Health-Safety seal, which it has maintained ever
since."
"The seal is awarded based on a global rating for ensuring spaces and sites adhere to science-backed health and safety
standards."
"Leadership in digital tomorrow
Further developing the digital and tech skills of our managers makes a crucial contribution to our Group strategy."
"Not only that,
but a modern leadership culture based on diversity and humanity is essential both for our Company’s long-term commercial
success and for attracting and retaining talents."
"We continued to pursue this strategic priority during the reporting year
through the continual evolution of our leadership culture and through a range of leadership skilling programs."
"We believe that the ongoing development of our leadership culture within
the Group has a positive effect on our employees and thus also on our success as a company."
"This is further borne out by the
findings from the most recent pulse survey, which identifies team attractiveness and a culture of trust as key factors driving
employee satisfaction."
"Essentially, this culture must also be directly palpable in the interpersonal interactions of managers and
employees."
"The cultural guidelines for our managers are contained in our Leadership Anchors, which were implemented Group-
wide in the reporting year, and serve to translate our Guiding Principles into leadership action."

"Specially trained talent brokers are invaluable in this context: they
draw up personal development plans together with the talents, discuss career paths, facilitate networking among talents, raise
their visibility, and actively recommend them for executive positions when a vacancy arises."
"In 2023, 35 Global TalentHub
participants signed an executive contract, i.e., 22 % of executive positions were filled with GTH talents in the reporting year
(excluding T‑Mobile US)."
"We are also intensifying the connection between talent development and succession planning to
identify career paths early on."
"In 2023, more than 79 % of our active talents are already on executive succession planning
pathways."
"After the successful launch of levelUP!NextGeneration in 2019, we not only offered the program again in the reporting year
in digital format, but went one step further and substantially expanded the scope."
"While still a program for talents, including
(future) leaders, it is now also suitable for tech and digital experts who have no ambitions to solid-line leadership."
"This move
has transformed this former dedicated leadership skilling program into a program which supports a variety of career paths
within the Group."
"A total of almost 900 employees from across the globe, including around 594 (prospective) managers and
just under 260 tech and digital experts from 18 countries, completed the four-month skilling program."
"Its primary focus is on
teaching innovative, inspirational, and tangible leadership topics and skills relating to digitalization and technology."

"125
Alongside the central initiatives, our Germany, Europe, and Systems Solutions operating segments, plus the Technology and
Innovation Board department, also offer their own talent programs which specifically prepare employees to take on their first
leadership duties within the segment."
"For example, the Europe operating segment runs a “30 under 30” program offering
targeted support for very young leadership talents."
"In our Germany operating segment, the OSD Talent Reise springboard
program is preparing 1,025 participants for the next phase of their career journey."
"This program teaches leadership skills in
addition to focusing on expert careers."
"HR IT & data-driven HR
Technology has proved to be instrumental in driving improvements in the efficiency, agility, and competitiveness of our
organization."
"In Human Resources, powerful HR systems are essential for implementing our strategic priorities."
"Yet today’s
HR IT landscape within the Group is shaped by heterogeneous legacy structures and disparate data models."
"In the reporting
year, we defined a simplified HR IT target architecture."
"We have also seen AI emerge this year as a force to be reckoned with
in the technology world."
"From selecting applicants to developing employees, AI is capable of improving HR process efficiency
across the board."
"We began looking at the opportunities and risks of AI early on and have already integrated initial elements into
the blueprint for our future HR IT."
Several of the elements of this IT architecture are described below for illustrative purposes.
Implementation of AI applications.
We introduced Eightfold in selected companies in the reporting year.
"Eightfold is a talent
intelligence platform that enables us to make recruitment and skill management more dynamic and personalized through
the use of AI."
"In the solution’s marketplace, AI matches requirements profiles from advertised positions and projects with the
profiles of employees and applicants in a pre-selection phase."
"The tool identifies individual training recommendations based on
skill profiles to support employees’ individual and personal development."
"Another example of how we use generative AI in HR is
the pilot of a chat-based employee concierge, which can answer general questions relating to HR products and services."
"This is
yet another example of how Deutsche Telekom uses AI responsibly."
"While we leverage the benefits offered by a large language
model available on the market for text generation, the database is subject to strict data privacy requirements."
"T‑Mobile US, too, is concentrating on the transition to an AI-enabled, data-driven future."
"AI and data are used within HR to
improve the employee experience, reshape the way we work, and elevate the corporate culture."
"AI is currently being leveraged
in all kinds of ways, e.g., to enhance the search functionality on various platforms, to provide customized and personalized
experiences, for in-depth data analysis, to automate predictable tasks using bots, or to write complex code."
"One example of this
is the Mentor Match platform, which uses machine learning to review user profile information and suggest strong mentoring
matches based on user needs and requests."
"This allows for the most profound and meaningful mentoring experience for
employees."
"In addition to integrating AI, we also use extended analytical models to analyze large data volumes
with greater precision and gain the necessary insights for sound decision-making in HR management and development."
"One
outcome in the reporting year was the introduction in some companies of a system for analyzing employee departures and
making predictions about, e.g., unwanted staff churn."
"This also involves developing a standardized data catalog as the basis for
a uniform data pool within the Group."
"The next step is to implement and establish further reporting and analytics capabilities in
2024."
"As all areas of life become digitalized, what employees need and expect from HR products and services
is changing significantly."
"We respond to this by explicitly focusing on the people experience as integral to the further
development of our HR products and services."
"Through specifically promoting the people experience in the HR portfolio,
employees and managers are able to complete their HR tasks with greater productivity and efficiency."
"A positive people
experience helps us to strengthen the employer brand, enhance employee loyalty, and improve the attractiveness of the
workplace."
"We have introduced apps in several international units to give our employees quick and easy access to our HR
products and services."
"With 33 services, the most extensive of these apps is currently available in Germany and is used
regularly by more than 52,000 employees – a real success story."

Headcount development
The Group’s headcount fell by 3.4 % compared with the end of the prior year."
"In our Germany operating segment, the number of
employees increased by 1.2 % against year-end 2022, mainly due to the transfer of employees of Multimedia Solutions (MMS)
from the Systems Solutions operating segment."
"The total number of full-time equivalent employees in the United States
operating segment decreased by 6.6 % compared with the end of 2022, primarily due to the workforce reduction program
implemented in the third quarter of 2023."
"In our Europe operating segment, the headcount was down by 3.4 % compared
with the end of the prior year, in particular in Slovakia, Poland, and Greece."
"The headcount in our Systems Solutions operating
segment was down 5.0 % against year-end 2022, mainly due to the transfer of MMS into the Germany operating segment."
"In
the Group Development operating segment, the sharp year-on-year decrease in headcount of 87.0 % was mainly due to the
sale of GD Towers as of February 1, 2023."
"The headcount in the Group Headquarters & Group Services segment was down 0.9 %
compared with the end of 2022, mainly due to the continued staff restructuring measures at Vivento."
"This decrease was offset
by the increase in the number of employees in the Technology and Innovation Board of Management department."

Technology and innovation
T&I strategy: digital transformation and human centricity
At Deutsche Telekom, innovation means creating the best possible (digital) customer experience on the basis of our multiple
award-winning network – now and in the future."
"This is precisely the task of our Technology and Innovation Board of Management
department, which works in close cooperation with our operating segments."
"The Technology and Innovation Board of
Management department is where we combine and integrate our Technology, Innovation, IT, and Security functions."
"This
structure will allow us to meet the demands of the future network generation and the associated requirements not only of our
customers, but also of our employees, our partners, and our shareholders – in terms of network security and sustainability,
too."
"Our Group strategy applies to high-speed broadband access, as well as responsible network production."
"That is an
economic and ecological necessity, especially given growing cloudification, increasing data traffic, and the rising number and
concentration of active components in our network."
We are thus in a position both to enable Deutsche Telekom’s current business and at the same time to shape the future.
"We
are convinced that we can reliably deliver results, constantly develop product, industry, and technological innovations, and
simultaneously hone and refine our ways of working."
"Innovation priorities
Innovations can be produced everywhere."
"That is why it is important to ensure we pursue our innovation activities at an
intragroup level and that they are aligned with our strategy."
"Our interconnected innovation areas provide a holistic, Group-wide
framework for this."
"In the reporting year, we further built on our activities in the prior year to evolve our innovation priorities in
close coordination with the operating segments."
Delivery Innovation: Technology and Innovation is a supplier and service provider for the Group.
"As such, it is particularly
important that we consistently meet our obligations."
"That means conscientiously delivering our services, leveraging the
synergies offered by centralized production, and working cost efficiently."
"At the same time, we can also shape the future,
e.g., by promoting agile working methods to make our production future-proof."
Experience Innovation: We are Deutsche Telekom’s central innovation unit.
"Constantly pursuing innovations that benefit our
customers, the Group, and all other stakeholders is our task and our obligation – but we also consider it an expression of the
freedom we enjoy."
Our technological innovations form the underpinnings for this.
"Capability Innovation: Continuing to turn Deutsche Telekom into a software-based company entails transforming our
capabilities on an ongoing basis."
"Changes become entrenched especially when accompanied by cultural innovation in the
shape of skills transformation and the systematic retraining and further training of our employees as software engineers, AI
experts, and network architects."
"In 2023, some 2,000 employees attended our proven Skill Academies to gain training in
topics including artificial intelligence (AI), DevOps, software development, and more."
"The focus was on significantly raising
their seniority level and equipping them with skills for the future."
"Home experience & TV: Our home experience product area bundles the topics of broadband connectivity, smart home, and
TV and entertainment to better serve the increasing convergence of these applications and services in our customers’ homes."
"We want to offer our customers a communication and entertainment experience from a single source, and plan to gradually
roll out products and services that offer exactly this in all markets of our European footprint in the coming years."
"Our goal is
to offer our customers the best devices (routers, mesh Wi-Fi, TV set-top boxes) and set ourselves apart from our competitors
with data-driven applications as well as differentiated and personalized services."
"To this end, we are
developing for example our own router operating system for the digital future."
"This new router generation is based on a
globally scalable reference system, which we are constantly fine-tuning together with other telecommunications providers
– cloud-based and with standardized, intuitive access via app, PC, or television."
"Examples of customer applications include
Wi-Fi management with on-premises troubleshooting, child protection functions, home security and automation, and more."
"In TV and entertainment, our focus is on consolidating the technical platforms, optimizing the customer experience, and
improving the content offering through the further aggregation of renowned providers like Netflix and Disney+."
"Additionally,
we continually work to improve our TV voice control and are set to roll this out to further markets outside of Germany."

Three-pronged innovation strategy
We set ourselves apart from the competition and generate growth in three ways:
1."
"In-house developments
In 2023, we continued to pursue our current innovation topics and developed new products."
"T-Labs is the research and development unit of Deutsche Telekom, focusing on translating new technology trends into tangible
results for our innovation portfolio."
"From its base in Berlin, T-Labs cooperates with multiple universities around the world."
"Digital channels: We are consistently optimizing our digital channels for our customers, with the goal of delivering a modern,
superior digital experience based on state-of-the-art technology."
"One area of focus is our centrally developed sales and
service app (MeinMagenta/OneApp), which is already established across all of our relevant markets and is used by more
than two-thirds of our customers."
"It helps us monetize our product portfolio through up- and cross-selling, and bring
down costs by reducing service cases through self-service and preventive maintenance."
"New services, such as through the
Magenta Moments loyalty program, are continually being rolled out and optimized, to further drive up the already relatively
high app penetration and customer satisfaction levels."
"We offer another possibility for interaction through our digital retail
platform, OneShop, which is already in use in five countries."
"In customer interactions – whether digital or in person – we
want to ensure that we can offer customers the best customer experience every time."
"To this end, we introduced, among
other measures, new, targeted business processes with personalized offerings to enhance the customer experience."
"We have
established Magenta View, a powerful support and troubleshooting channel that provides access to all internal technology
and customer databases, and are set to gradually roll out this system in all of our European markets over the coming years."
"AI Competence Center: The AICC’s mission is to use (generative) AI to unlock improvements in efficiency, the customer
experience, and the employee experience."
"The AICC does this on the one hand by offering practical and technical support
for all Deutsche Telekom units to help them quickly deploy generative AI in particular."
"On the other, the AICC advises
colleagues on using AI ethically and securely, and assists with selecting suitable partners."
"By integrating (generative) AI,
we will ensure that our products and services remain competitive into the future."
"The focus of our
activities in the reporting year continued to be on scaling up our AI-based Frag Magenta digital assistants for chat and
telephone."
The aim of these digital assistants is to further personalize all customer interactions across all points of contact.
"In November 2023, German computer magazine Computer Bild and market statistics company Statista once again named
our Frag Magenta chatbot the best chatbot by a German telecommunications provider."
"Telco-as-a-platform: Under our strategic concept, Telco-as-a-platform, we are driving forward developments to
disaggregate, cloudify, and automate our network production making increased use of data and AI."
"This approach aims to
both improve the customer experience considerably and increase flexibility and scalability, while simultaneously lowering
costs."
"We will achieve this with software solutions for automated error detection, analysis, and correction based on machine
learning, among other solutions."
"Together with other network operators as part of the O-RAN Alliance, we are working
towards defining a global standard for an open, intelligent, virtualized, and interoperable radio access network."
"The i14y Lab
in Berlin offers a testing ground for the interoperability of O-RAN components."
"The innovative approach to network
production unlocks new opportunities to directly monetize the network, for instance, via network application programming
interfaces (APIs)."
An initiative in this area was set up in 2022: CAMARA – The Telco Global API Alliance.
"Its goal is to identify
the needs of the developer community and, on this basis, to specify and implement open, globally standardized APIs to
enable simple, uniform, codable access to network functionalities across all telecommunication providers."
"In addition to
innovating and evolving the fixed and mobile networks, we also analyze which benefits we can generate for our customers
from the appropriate integration of satellite-based access networks into our portfolio."
"Example applications include coverage
for regions previously in dead spots, or the rapid provision of communication services following natural disasters or other
emergencies."
Standalone 5G: The 5G radio access network has been integrated with the new 5G core network to create 5G standalone.
"This
core network is the source of crucial innovations and benefits, because it removes the need for terminal devices to connect to
the 4G and 5G networks in parallel."
"Network
slices could therefore be used, for example, for applications where bandwidth and latency are critical, such as augmented/
virtual reality; for communication among authorities where security is critical; or for secure, high-availability applications for
business customers."
"Sustainable Telco:
This innovation area is devoted to making the telecommunications industry more
sustainable."
"With a view to safeguarding long-term access to affordable green energy, our main focus is on energy efficiency
and energy resilience."
"This includes location-based usage of regenerative energy with dynamic energy storage management
for load balancing, as well as AI-powered, load-dependent energy-saving mechanisms."
"For example, rapid, temporary mobile
network coverage following natural disasters or for large-scale events is already being successfully delivered by mobile cell
towers with hydrogen-based fuel cell technology."

"In addition to actively promoting cooperation between T-Labs and universities, we also work
closely with our HR department as part of the Magenta Campus Team to anchor the topic of talent attraction."
"With our insights into future technology innovations, we thus also contribute
to society by encouraging young people, in particular girls and young women, to pursue the STEM subjects."
"In November 2023, T‑Labs and T‑Mobile US launched the fourth edition of the T Challenge, a global innovation competition for
start-ups, developers, and research institutions."
"The aim of the competition is to promote innovative solutions and approaches
based on AI for telecommunications, which are presented to an international audience of experts."
"T‑Labs and T‑Mobile US
collaborate closely with intragroup stakeholders on the T Challenge in order to develop specific solutions for
Deutsche Telekom."
The goal is to strengthen the company’s competitiveness and develop new business opportunities.
"In the
past, selected teams received investment, contracts have been concluded, and promising pilots were carried out."
You can find more information on the T Challenge on the website.
"The Future Networks unit focuses on unlocking the potential of technologies to
significantly enhance the future performance of telecommunications networks."

foundation for immersive services of the future."
"To this end, together with the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial
Technology and other national and international partners, we have launched a project on digital twin systems with autonomous,
mobile industrial robotics in 5G campus networks."
"Deutsche Telekom already began establishing a European identity network at
the end of 2022 as a founding member of the European cooperative IDunion."
"In 2023, together with further IDunion industry
partners, Deutsche Telekom put a pre-production network into operation, developed the associated governance framework,
and worked on the identity network’s GDPR-compliant regular operations."
"Many of the accomplishments and technological
advancements in the identity field which are now being posited in the EU’s Architecture and Reference Framework stem from
the IDunion’s research project and are incorporated directly into the consultation process."
"Not only that, we also developed
the first prototype of a European digital identity wallet and are beginning to see some initial commissions and commercial
success for digital identities."
"Our efforts in this regard play a major role in digitalizing Germany and spreading digital identities
to millions of customers."

"For example, we rely
on the tremendous innovative energy coming out of Silicon Valley, Israel, China, Korea, India, Germany, and other innovation
hotspots across the globe."
"The following are some examples of successful partnerships:
3."
"Start-up funding
As Deutsche Telekom’s leading start-up program, the hubraum tech incubator puts external start-ups in touch with the relevant
business units in our Group, so that together they can offer innovative products to consumers and business customers."
"To
this end, hubraum provides the start-ups with seed financing from its own investment fund and targeted innovation programs
geared to our strategic growth areas and technologies."
"Our strategic partnership with SK Telecom reached a milestone in the form of the joint development of an industry-specific
voice model for telecommunications companies."
"We will tailor this model specifically to the needs of digital assistants

"Implementation is set to take place as part of the Global Telco AI Alliance, announced by
Deutsche Telekom, e&, Singtel, and SK Telecom in summer 2023."
"The goal of collaborating with AI companies like Anthropic
and Meta is to create a multilingual voice model (German, English, Korean, etc.) and improve our generative AI tools."
"In the 5G field, we are working with Blue Planet, Ericsson, and Mavenir to demonstrate ground-breaking multi-domain
orchestration with open APIs."
"This is realized through a proof of concept, which showcases the benefits of this orchestration
for companies’ services."
"The feasibility study highlights how enterprises can order a product in Deutsche Telekom’s customer
portal, which starts the automatic configuration of a secure, dedicated network slice with guaranteed Quality of Service
levels."
This slice is delivered dynamically and automatically in line with the customer’s specific connectivity requirements.
"The 5G network enables the end-to-end service offering to be activated in minutes, from the user equipment to the
company’s application."
"To implement this use case for company services, the partners worked together to deploy a 5G
standalone network infrastructure in test mode at Deutsche Telekom’s labs in Darmstadt and Bonn."
"In collaboration with Google and GSMA, we have developed an industry-wide standard for transferring eSIMs between
mobile devices and are the first mobile communications company to use this standard globally."
"The new process enables
customers to transfer their mobile contract to their new device with just a few clicks."
"All they need is their old and new mobile
phones in close proximity to each other."
"This fast, secure solution takes place in seconds directly in the setup wizard, no app,
website login, or phone call to customer service needed."
"Our partnership with Google has been further strengthened with the aim of minimizing the digital divide and making the
most of the benefits of connected technologies."
"This extends to the development of our own brands – the T Phone and

Deutsche Telekom has teamed up with the European Space Agency (ESA) with a focus on maximum network resilience.
"Under the leitmotif “Always on,” we signed a memorandum of understanding at Mobile World Congress 2023."
"Together, we
will work on the development of hybrid networks of the future, which will enable seamless connectivity between terrestrial
networks and alternative networks in space and in the air."
"Natural disasters, such as the recent earthquakes in Turkey and
Syria, show how important it is to have resilient connectivity."
"The integration of non-terrestrial network components, such
as satellites or flying antenna platforms in the stratosphere, into a hybrid network can take the place of infrastructure on the
ground to maintain contact with the people affected and rescue teams."
"Deutsche Telekom has already successfully achieved
an orchestrated 5G connection across different network layers for the first time worldwide."

"Investment decisions regarding our multi-year innovation
priorities are based directly on the recommendations of an internal venture capitalist."
"Funding is allocated according to
success, similar to the approach used for start-ups and among venture capital investors, whereby new funding from capital
investors is made available dependent on the venture’s performance."
"This gives us the flexibility we need when developing
innovation topics and focuses efforts on success."
"Funding is made available for the next project phase only when specific
outcomes that are relevant to our customers are achieved."
"Corporate Innovation Fund (CIF)
Similar to a venture capital approach, the CIF offers all business and product ideas generated within the Group a flexible and
results-oriented form of funding for a specific project phase."
"The provision of an innovation budget allows us, for example,
to fund new innovation projects at short notice and with little red tape."
"Such financing is granted independently of annual
planning periods, and therefore intensifies our focus on market and customer requirements."
"For new business and product
ideas to qualify for CIF funding, they must solve pertinent customer problems, be implemented jointly with the business areas,
and support our strategy."
"Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners
The investment management group Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners invests on behalf of Deutsche Telekom and other
investors."
"DTCP invests in venture and growth capital and acquires companies in Europe, the United States, and Israel."

"Investment in research and development
Research and development (R&D) expenditure includes pre-production research and development, such as the search for
alternative products, processes, systems, and services."
"By contrast, we do not class as R&D expenditure
the costs of developing system and user software which is designed to improve productivity and make our business processes
more effective."
R&D expenditure in the Deutsche Telekom Group amounted to EUR 25 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 30 million).
"As the parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG bears part of the Group’s research and development expenditure."
"The
expenditure was down year-on-year at EUR 11 million."
"In 2023, our Group’s investments in internally generated intangible
assets to be capitalized were slightly up year-on-year at EUR 708 million compared with EUR 702 million for the previous
year."
"These investments predominantly relate to internally developed software, mainly in our Group Headquarters & Group
Services segment."
"In 2023, Deutsche Telekom AG’s investments in internally generated intangible assets to be capitalized were
EUR 2 million compared with EUR 28 million for the previous year."

Statement by the Board of Management on the expected development of the Group
The qualities that mark us out as an anchor of stability in difficult times remain in demand in a geopolitically and
macroeconomically challenging environment."
"Our results for 2023 and our sound plans for sustainable growth once again
demonstrate these capabilities and the trust that is placed in them."
"In the reporting year, significant transactions were closed
and we secured a majority stake in T‑Mobile US."
"We want to use this strong starting position going forwards to underpin our
success with solid financial growth rates, further extend our technology leadership with the best state-of-the-art networks, and
thereby contribute to the implementation of our Leading Digital Telco vision."

Economic outlook
The global economy continues to be beset by the challenges of relatively high interest rates and dampened growth prospects."
"In its economic forecast from January 2024, the IMF expects global economic growth in 2024 to remain at the prior-year level
of 3.1 %."
"Tougher financing conditions, weak trade growth, and diminished business and consumer confidence are negatively
impacting the economic outlook."
"Growing geopolitical tensions are further contributing to increased uncertainty about the
economic outlook."
"Despite these challenges, we expect moderate growth for our core markets for the full year 2024."
"The following table shows the expected GDP growth rate trends and the change in harmonized consumer prices in our most
important markets for 2024 and 2025."
"Expectations for the Group
Expectations up to 2025."
We expect profitable growth to continue over the next two years.
"This will provide a sound basis for
achieving our financial ambitions – as communicated at our Capital Markets Day in May 2021."
"We expect our financial performance indicators to develop as follows in 2024 and 2025 on an organic basis, i.e., on a like-for-
like basis with the prior year:
Revenue is expected to increase by an average of 1 to 2 %; service revenue by an average of 3 to 4 %."
"Adjusted EBITDA AL is expected to increase by 3 to 5 % on average; adjusted core EBITDA AL, i.e., adjusted EBITDA AL
excluding revenues from terminal equipment leases in the United States, is expected to increase by 5 to 6 % on average."
"Free cash flow AL (before dividend payments and spectrum investment) is expected to increase steadily, exceeding
EUR 18 billion in 2024."
Earnings per share (adjusted for special factors) is expected to exceed EUR 1.75 in 2024.
Revenue is likely to increase in 2024.
We also expect service revenue to increase.
Adjusted EBITDA AL is expected to be around EUR 42.9 billion in 2024.
"In the reporting year, adjusted EBITDA AL came in
at EUR 40.5 billion; on a like-for-like basis, i.e., adjusted for comparability with the adjusted EBITDA AL forecast for 2024,
adjusted EBITDA AL stood at EUR 40.6 billion."
We expect adjusted core EBITDA AL to increase significantly in 2024.
Free cash flow AL is expected to amount to around EUR 18.9 billion in 2024.
"Free cash flow AL in 2023 was EUR 16.1 billion;
on a like-for-like basis, i.e., adjusted for comparability with the free cash flow AL forecast for 2024, free cash flow AL stood at
EUR 16.2 billion."
We are anticipating earnings per share (adjusted for special factors) of over EUR 1.75 in 2024.
We expect revenue to increase both in 2024 and in 2025 on the back of the positive development of service revenue.
"The
primary driver of this trend will be the United States operating segment, where we likewise expect revenue to grow in both
2024 and 2025."
"We expect revenue in the Germany and Europe operating segments to increase slightly in both 2024 and
2025."
Service revenue is projected to increase in both 2024 and 2025.
"This trend will be influenced by the growth expected in the

Our debt issuance program puts us in a position to place issues in the international capital markets at short notice."
"T‑Mobile US
is being refinanced primarily in the form of senior unsecured notes."
"We can also issue short-term papers in the money market
through our Deutsche Telekom and T‑Mobile US commercial paper programs."
"Bonds and other financial liabilities in the total amount of EUR 5.8 billion and EUR 6.5 billion will fall due for repayment in 2024
and 2025, respectively, of which around EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 5.0 billion, respectively, relate to T‑Mobile US."
"A number of
T‑Mobile US bonds include issuer termination rights."
"If the premature termination and refinancing of these bonds result in
economic gains, this could give rise to further refinancing requirements."
We plan to issue new bonds in various currencies.
"The
exact financing transactions will depend on developments in the international finance markets."
"We also intend to cover part
of our liquidity requirements by issuing commercial paper."
"In January 2024, T‑Mobile US issued bonds with a total volume of
USD 3 billion to cover some of its refinancing needs in 2024 at an early stage."
"We want to continue leveraging economies of scale and synergies through suitable partnerships or appropriate acquisitions in
our footprint markets."
"There are no plans, however, to expand into emerging markets."
"We will continue to subject our existing
partnerships and equity investments to regular strategic reassessments with a view to maximizing the value of our Company."
"If the economic situation should deteriorate or any unforeseen state or regulatory interventions arise, the expectations
expressed here may change accordingly."
"Given the level of macroeconomic uncertainty, we also cannot rule out the possibility
of deviations."
Adjusted EBITDA AL is expected to increase to around EUR 42.9 billion in 2024 and to increase substantially in 2025.
"In
particular, revenue and the realization of synergies from the business combination of T‑Mobile US and Sprint will have a
positive impact."
"The gradual withdrawal from the business model of terminal equipment leases in the United States, with
revenues from terminal equipment leases being offset primarily by the depreciation of the capitalized terminal devices
on the expenses side, is expected to be almost completed from 2024."
"The resulting impact on the development of
adjusted EBITDA AL will therefore only be minimal in 2024."
"Terminal equipment leases were a major pillar, in particular, at
Sprint."
"In its place, marketing activities have shifted increasingly toward the Equipment Installment Plan."
"We expect adjusted core EBITDA AL to increase substantially in both 2024 and 2025, driven by the realization of synergies
from the business combination of T‑Mobile US and Sprint."
"Adjusted core EBITDA AL is distinguished by excluding revenues
from terminal equipment leases in the United States from adjusted EBITDA AL, thereby presenting operational development
undistorted by the withdrawal from the terminal equipment lease business model."
"For this reason, we are adding adjusted
core EBITDA AL to our financial performance indicators for the years of the withdrawal from the business model of terminal
equipment leases in the United States for explanatory purposes – likely for the final time."
We anticipate a sharp decrease in profit/loss from operations (EBIT) in 2024 followed by a sharp increase in 2025.
"Expected
EBIT will benefit overall from the positive trend in adjusted EBITDA AL, developing accordingly."
"However, it is expected to
decline initially in 2024 – on account of the large positive effect recorded in 2023 due to the income from the sale of shares
in GD Towers that has been recognized as a special factor."
"ROCE is expected to decrease significantly in 2024 before rising again sharply in 2025, due to the effects described for
the development of EBIT."
"We expect to achieve our target for ROCE to be higher than the expected weighted average cost
of capital (WACC) for future years, following the increased burden from the integration costs arising from the business
combination of T‑Mobile US and Sprint."
"Our investments – measured in terms of cash capex (before spectrum investments) – are expected to decline to around
EUR 15.9 billion in 2024 on account of the largely completed network integration in connection with the business
combination with Sprint in the United States."
"In 2025, cash capex (before spectrum investment) is expected to remain stable."
"We want to continue investing heavily in building out our network infrastructure in Germany, the United States, and Europe
in order to safeguard our technology leadership in the long term."
"Free cash flow AL (before dividend payments and spectrum investment) is expected to increase significantly to around
EUR 18.9 billion in 2024."
"We also expect a further strong increase in free cash flow AL in 2025 due to sound operational
development."
"At the end of 2023, the rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Fitch gave us a rating of BBB+, and Moody’s of Baa1."
"All three
rating agencies gave us a stable outlook."
"Maintaining an investment grade rating within the A– to BBB range will enable us
to retain access to the international capital markets and is thus a key component of our finance strategy."
"We are anticipating earnings per share (adjusted for special factors) of over EUR 1.75 in 2024, based on the sound expected
business development."
We expect to see adjusted earnings per share increase again in 2025.

Expectations for Deutsche Telekom AG."
"The development of business at Deutsche Telekom AG, the Group’s parent company,
is reflected particularly in its service relationships with its subsidiaries, the results of the subsidiaries’ domestic reporting
units, and other income from subsidiaries, and from associated and related companies."
"In other words, our subsidiaries’
results from operations and the opportunities and challenges they face are key factors shaping the future development of
Deutsche Telekom AG’s figures."
"Accordingly, in addition to our expectations for the Group, the expectations described on
the following pages concerning the operating segments’ revenue and earnings – such as strong competition, regulatory
intervention, market and economic expectations, etc."
"– have an impact on our expectations concerning the development of
Deutsche Telekom AG’s future income after taxes."
"Since 2021, subject to approval by the relevant bodies and the fulfillment of other legal requirements, the amount of the
dividend is based on a dividend payout ratio of 40 to 60 % of adjusted earnings per share, with a lower limit fixed at EUR 0.60
per dividend-bearing share."
"For the 2023 financial year, we propose a dividend of EUR 0.77 for each dividend-bearing share."
Deutsche Telekom AG’s unappropriated net income exceeded the prior-year forecast.
"It includes, among other factors, the
positive effects on earnings from the sale of 51.0 % of the shares in companies of the German and Austrian cell tower business
as well as income from the repayment of capital by a subsidiary which was partially recognized in income."
"For 2024, we do
not expect any significant changes in the contributions of the subsidiaries to operating results."
"For the 2024 financial year as a
whole, we expect an unappropriated net income that will allow the distribution of a dividend of 40 to 60 % of adjusted earnings
per share."
"Expectations for the operating segments
Below, we explain the market expectations and the expectations for the financial and non-financial performance indicators of
our operating segments."
"We assume a comparable consolidated group and constant exchange rates for the development of
our performance indicators."
We presented more information on the expected development of the operating segments at our Capital Markets Day in May 2021.
"Following the sale of T‑Mobile Netherlands as of March 31, 2022 and 51.0 % of the shares in GD Towers as of February 1, 2023,
our Group Development operating segment no longer makes a significant contribution to the expectations of the Group’s
significant performance indicators."
"For this reason our forecast does not provide a separate presentation of the figures for this
segment or a corresponding explanation."
"Germany
Following the increase in revenue in the German market for telecommunications services in the reporting year, market research
company Analysys Mason forecasts further revenue growth in 2024, albeit at a slower pace."
"Demand for mobile and fixed-
network communications is expected to remain stable in an environment of moderate economic recovery."
"In the German mobile market, revenues are expected to increase by
0.9 % and service revenues to fall by 0.1 % in 2024 (source: Analysys Mason)."
"In the Germany fixed-network business including
television, the number of broadband lines will continue to rise; revenues are expected to grow by 1.1 % (source: Analysys
Mason)."
"The mobile communications market in Germany is currently dominated by three providers, each with nationwide network
infrastructure, deploying 4G/LTE and 5G technology to ensure that the majority of the population has access to mobile
internet."
"In December 2023, Drillisch Netz AG, a subsidiary of United Internet AG, began to market mobile rate plans on its
mobile network."
"To do this, it largely makes use of wholesale national roaming services provided by Telefónica Deutschland,
having fewer than 100 own cell towers in operation."
"As the build-out of this fourth mobile network continues, infrastructure
competition is expected to increase."
"Furthermore, competition from mobile providers without their own network infrastructure
is also likely to increase further."
"In mobile communications, we lead the market for network coverage: At the end of 2023, 95.9 % of the population in Germany
had access to our 5G network."
"With the continued build-out, we want to further improve our network quality."
"To this end, we
will increase network density and capacity further both in rural areas and in cities."
The market for fixed-network broadband hosts a large number of players with differing infrastructures.
"We are assuming that
competition from cable network operators will remain intense and that the number of providers who have their own fiber-
optic networks will increase."
"In addition to the established telecommunications companies, there are more and more public
utilities, municipalities, and special purpose associations, as well as investor-driven network providers active in the market with
FTTH infrastructure."

In the fixed network, we want to provide fiber-optic-based products to more and more customers."
"Our Germany-wide IP-based
network achieves high transmission bandwidths of up to 2 gigabits per second."
"In order to always offer our customers
competitive high-speed lines, we increasingly invest in digital infrastructure."
"We accelerated our FTTH rollout in the reporting
year and enable a total of around 8 million households to directly connect to our fiber-optic network."
"Our build-out will benefit
both people in towns and cities and those in rural areas."
"We are set to maintain our rapid FTTH build-out pace over the coming
years by building out on our own, but also through partnerships, with the addition of around 2.5 million households per year."
Our goal is to roll out fiber-optic lines to more than 10 million households and companies by the end of 2024.
"We will use a wide
range of partnership models to increase the utilization rate of our broadband infrastructure by our own retail business as well
as through partnerships with wholesale providers in broadband marketing."
The number of TV households in the German TV market is stable.
"In summer 2024, the privilege for property owners to pass on
cable TV and internet service fees as ancillary rental costs to tenants will be abolished."
"It can be expected that the willingness
of these customers to switch provider will increase."
"With MagentaTV, we provide a wide variety of entertainment “from a
single source” and want to further grow our TV customer base with an attractive offering."
"In order to offer our customers the
best possible user experience, we are also engaging in partnerships, for example with RTL, Disney, Netflix, Prime Video, Sky/
WOW, DAZN, and Apple TV+."
"We are constantly enhancing the functions of MagentaTV and complementing the portfolio with
exclusive content."
"For instance, in Germany, we will broadcast every match of UEFA EURO 2024, including pre- and post-match
coverage."
"Our goal is to continue expanding our position as the leading integrated telecommunications provider in the German market
by providing innovative and competitive products and services."
"We aim to further reduce the complexity of our products and
processes through automation and digitalization."
"We want to deliver the best customer experience with perfect service and
turn our customers into fans."
"To this end, we invest systematically in our networks and the brand experience."
"We improve
the service and shopping experience through our digital channels by creating more opportunities to offer customized and
contextualized products and services."
"For our business customers, we position ourselves as the preferred partner for
digitalization."
"In our Germany operating segment, we expect slight growth in revenue and service revenue in both 2024 and 2025, primarily
due to growing mobile and broadband revenues."
We expect customer numbers to grow in both business areas.
"In mobile
communications, we expect an increase in the high-value business with our own mobile brand."
"In broadband, we expect a
further increase in the number of customers with high-speed lines."
"We want to continue expanding our fiber-optic services,
both by means of business models with wholesale products and through further partnerships."
"Thanks to our excellent network quality and the progress we are making with fiber-optic build-out, we expect to see a further
increase in both 2024 and 2025 in the number of mobile customers as well as slight growth in our broadband lines, fueled by
demand for TV and high-speed products."
"In each of the next two years, we expect to post year-on-year increases in earnings in our Germany operating segment."
"For 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA AL of around EUR 10.5 billion, driven in particular by high-value revenue growth and a
simultaneous reduction in indirect costs, mainly through digitalization and automation."
"Our adjusted EBITDA AL is expected to
rise further in 2025."
"Our course is set for innovation and growth: While we will continue to consistently promote investments in new technologies
with great intensity in the future, we will wind down legacy systems, cutting costs in the process."
"Over the coming years, we
will focus our investments on building out forward-looking fixed-network and mobile infrastructure (e.g., FTTH and 5G)."
"Our aim
here will be to close gaps in the network in rural areas and provide urban centers with the high bandwidth they require."
"We want
to continue this rollout efficiently and, to this end, are participating in funding programs."
"We expect our capital expenditure
(cash capex before spectrum investment) to increase slightly year-on-year in both 2024 and 2025."

"T‑Mobile US expanded its 5G network leadership, by reaching 330 million people, utilizing the 600 MHz spectrum holdings
it acquired in April 2017."
"Deployment of recently-released mid-band licenses by T‑Mobile US should also drive the operator’s
expansion of 5G coverage."
"After completing the merger of T‑Mobile US and Sprint, T‑Mobile US continued to execute its profitable growth initiatives,
carrying great momentum into 2024."
"T‑Mobile US continues to focus on creating shareholder value and providing a
combination of best network and value experience in the U.S."
"Key elements of the company’s focus include
consistently and profitably outgrowing the competition, and making the necessary investments to position the company
for long term success."
"T‑Mobile US customer growth initiatives center on attracting and retaining a loyal customer base by
providing plans that are simple, affordable and without unnecessary restrictions to deliver value-added experience in wireless."
"T‑Mobile US further extends this winning formula by combining this best value proposition in the market with its leading
network experience."
T‑Mobile US expects continued increases in postpaid and slight increases in prepaid customers in 2024 and 2025.
"T‑Mobile US expects an increase in total revenues in 2024 and 2025 driven by increasing service revenue growth primarily from
postpaid account and ARPA growth offset by lower revenues in the wholesale base."
"Total revenues are expected to increase,
albeit, at a slower pace than service revenues as 5G device upgrade rates remain low tempering equipment revenues."
"For 2024, T‑Mobile US expects adjusted EBITDA AL of USD 30.8 billion and a strong increase in 2025."
"Revenue growth is
expected to outpace increases in expense as T‑Mobile US focuses on delivering profitable customer growth and driving further
operating efficiencies in the business."
"However, success-based investments to further unlock growth vectors, such as smaller
markets and rural areas and enterprise, may impact adjusted EBITDA AL."
"Adjusted core EBITDA AL, i.e., adjusted EBITDA AL
excluding revenues from handset leasing, is expected to increase strongly in 2024 and 2025."
"Excluding expenditures relating to spectrum, T‑Mobile US reached peak levels of cash capex in 2022 from its accelerated
network integration and the rapid pace of its 5G network deployment."
The company saw a decrease in 2023.
"T‑Mobile US
expects a continued decrease in cash capex in 2024 and stable investment in 2025, reflecting greater capital efficiencies from
its 5G network build."
"As well as the general uncertainty on
the markets, which mostly has a negative effect on the economy, economic outlooks are also coming under pressure from the
current ongoing high rates of inflation in the EU."
"The European Commission expects consumer prices to rise significantly again
in 2024."
This trend is not expected to let up until the following year.

lines."
"On top of this, the fiber-optic build-out is being accelerated."
"In most Central and Eastern European countries, there is

to grow by just under 1 % in both 2024 and 2025."
"For mobile revenues, Analysys Mason forecasts a stable development in 2024,
and in 2025, they are expected to decline for the first time by around 1 %."
We aspire to continue developing into the Leading Digital Telco in the coming years.
"All national companies in the Europe
operating segment except for Romania are integrated providers of telecommunications services, have high brand recognition
levels, and are very significant players in their respective home markets."
"We always put our customers at the heart of everything
we do."
"In the consumer segment, for example, we want to create the best customer experience by further developing products
and services in convergent product packages in our mature markets, using data and AI to better tailor them to specific target
groups and increase their personalization."
We also plan to continue engaging in partnerships with local and international OTT providers.
"In order to
improve the TV experience in households while at the same time realizing synergies, we are gradually standardizing both the
TV platforms and terminal equipment (set-top boxes) in our TV markets."
"This enables us to roll out new features as well as
updates in a more dynamic way and thus to make new content, whether linear or on-demand, available to our customers faster."
"Digital interaction with our customers is a key factor in meeting customer needs in a more personalized and efficient way, and
positioning products and innovative services on the market more quickly."
"Our service app is already used by more than two
thirds of our customers."
"It helps us monetize our product portfolio and bring down costs by reducing service cases through
self-service and preventive maintenance."
"We offer another possibility for interaction, for example, through our digital retail
platform OneShop."
"In customer interactions – whether digital or in person – we want to ensure that we can offer customers the
best customer experience."
"Thus, we believe we can retain and further build on our first place in customer satisfaction rankings
of telecommunications companies in the respective countries (as measured by the TRI*M index, which is based on empirical
research)."
We are able to do all this because we use our network infrastructure efficiently based on different technologies.
"With our fast
fiber-optic networks and the accelerated rollout of 5G, we are making our contribution to digitalization."
"In all our footprint
countries, we will gradually refarm the spectrum that is currently still used for 3G to increase LTE and 5G capacity."
"The build-
out of fiber-optic technology is also progressing further."
"By the end of 2024 and 2025, respectively, we will add around
3 million more households, increasing fiber-optic coverage from the current level of 9.1 million households (around 35 %
network coverage) to a level of 40 % and 46 % network coverage, respectively."
"We plan to increase the number of connected
households to around 4 million and thus to achieve a utilization rate of 36 % by 2024 and 35 % by 2025."
"In the B2B area, the ever more complex requirements of digitalization are putting pressure on companies and the public sector
to act."
"Here, we want to provide our customers with digital offers for every customer segment – with innovations beyond the
core offering of connectivity – and create sustainable business models."
"We enable this by way of a future-proof omnichannel
experience and digital capabilities, such as 24/7 support, self-service portals, and customer success managers."
"We will continue to build out these functions, constantly
expand our portfolio for all company sizes, and optimize our advisory approach with expert teams."
"In our Europe operating segment, we expect a positive trend in customer numbers in the next two years, primarily thanks to
the focus on delivering the best network experience, the best customer experience in interaction with us, and the best FMC
experience for consumers and business customers alike."
"We expect the number of mobile customers to increase slightly in both
2024 and 2025."
"We expect fixed-network lines to remain stable in 2024, and forecast a slight increase for 2025."
"We expect the
number of broadband customers to grow in both 2024 and 2025."
"For TV customers, we forecast a slight increase in both years."

We also expect service revenues to increase slightly in both years.
We assume that prices on the energy market will remain at a high level for the time being.
"The associated higher inflation in the
countries of our operating segment could increase pressure in future collective negotiations with employees’ representatives."
"In addition, highly intense competition in the markets of our operating segment could potentially put pressure on our margins."
"In order to realize cost-cutting potential, we intend to increase our productivity and exploit the benefits of digitalization, for
instance by automating processes."
"In order to be better prepared for rising energy prices, we concluded long-term power
purchase agreements in the reporting year with local suppliers in the respective European countries."
"Accordingly, we expect
adjusted EBITDA AL to grow to EUR 4.3 billion in 2024 and then to increase slightly in 2025."
"To maintain our technology leadership, we continue to invest in our integrated networks and plan to maintain the high overall
level of investments over the next few years."
"We expect cash capex (before spectrum investment) to increase slightly in 2024
and 2025."
"Systems Solutions
Overall, growth in the IT market is expected to continue at roughly the same rate over the coming years, while cost pressure
and intense competition are likely to persist."
"Nevertheless, we expect ongoing digitalization to drive further growth in demand
for solutions from the areas of cloud services, big data, and automation of business processes using artificial intelligence (AI),
as well as IT security (cybersecurity)."
"At the same time, this market is undergoing a radical transformation, e.g., due to ongoing standardization and automation,
demand for smart services, and the changes being wrought by cloud services in outsourcing business."
"Further challenges have
arisen in the shape of digitalization, the growing importance of cybersecurity, and AI."
"Traditional IT business will continue to
decline, while cloud services and cybersecurity may achieve double-digit growth rates."
"In line with this, our plan is to continue investing increasingly
in growth markets – especially in digitalization (e.g., AI, SAP S/4HANA), multi- and hybrid cloud services, and cybersecurity."
"In terms of revenue and market share, we are among the top IT service providers in the European IT market and in Germany."
"Our
very high levels of customer satisfaction – with a TRI*M score of over 90 – are a core element in maintaining this position in the
long term as well as in playing a leading role in digitalization."
"Overall, we forecast slight growth in order entry for the Systems Solutions operating segment in 2024 and again in 2025."
Revenue is expected to increase slightly in 2024 and then to remain stable in 2025.
"Revenue primarily comprises service
revenue, and as such, service revenue trends are key."
"Adjusted EBITDA AL is expected to increase slightly in 2024, reaching
around EUR 0.3 billion."
We expect adjusted EBITDA AL to increase again slightly in 2025.
"We expect cash capex (before
spectrum investment) to remain stable in both 2024 and 2025."
"Group Headquarters & Group Services
At Group Headquarters & Group Services, we have raised our efficiency ambitions and introduced further steps to reduce costs
in the coming years."
"This will primarily involve reallocating human resources, further enhancing the value of our real estate
portfolio by means of innovative space and workplace concepts, and simplifying product services for the Group."
"In addition,
we have also questioned seemingly smaller cost items in order to achieve strict cost efficiency across all areas."
"Our operating
segments also benefit from the ability to provide our services more cost-effectively thanks to the cost-cutting measures."
"In
facing up to our responsibility to a sustainable future, we decided to offset our entire carbon footprint by way of central
procurement of carbon certificates for the entire Group."
"In addition, we are still focusing on converting our vehicle fleet to
e-mobility and, through numerous construction measures, setting the course to ensure that our real estate portfolio satisfies
the high ESG requirements."

In the coming years, too, our Board of Management department Technology and Innovation will drive not only the development
of innovative technologies, products, and services, but also IT standardization and the ongoing establishment of centralized
production platforms."
"Major areas of capital expenditure in the years 2024 and 2025 will include technology development,
the implementation of our IT strategy, artificial intelligence (AI), and IT security."
"We expect this to reduce overheads, mainly
driven by the reduction in IT operating costs, the ongoing standardization of IT infrastructure and platforms – mainly through
cloudification, automation, and retiring – and by standardizing IT interfaces."
"Further efficiency enhancement measures will be
drawn up in order to remain competitive in the future in the area of our internal IT service provider."
"In the long term, these savings will help the Group finance its innovation endeavors."
"Technology innovations will serve to safeguard the network and technology leadership of our German, Europe, and
United States operating segments in the long term."
"Ultimately, in addition to enhancing customer experience, every one of our
investment projects revolves around people."
"Risk and opportunity management
Board of Management’s assessment of the aggregate risk and opportunity position
The assessment of the aggregate risk position is the outcome of the consolidated analysis of all material risk categories or
individual risks."
"The aggregate risk position has deteriorated compared with the prior year due to a potential expansion of the
ban on Chinese network components, the growing threat level imposed by cyberattacks, the enduring pressures on global
economic development, and the tense geopolitical situation."
"Our major challenges particularly include the regulatory factors,
economic uncertainties, and intense competition and the associated pressure on profitability in the telecommunications
business, as well as the pressure to change arising from new technologies and strategic transformation."
"At the time of preparing
this report, neither our risk management system nor our management could identify any material risks or developments that
threaten the continued existence of Deutsche Telekom AG or a significant Group company as a going concern."
"We are convinced that we will also be able to master challenges and exploit opportunities in the future without having to take
on any unacceptably high risks for our business or for society and the environment."
"We strive to achieve a good overall balance
between opportunities and risks, with the aim of increasing added value for our stakeholders by analyzing and seizing new
market opportunities."
"In order to operate successfully in this ongoing volatile environment, we anticipate potential
developments at an early stage and systematically identify, assess, and manage the resulting risks and opportunities."
"We
therefore consider a functioning risk and opportunity management system to be a central element of value-oriented corporate
governance."
"A risk and opportunity management system of this kind is not only necessary from a business point of view; it is also required
by laws and regulations, in particular § 91 (2) and (3) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG)."
"Deutsche Telekom AG’s Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the internal control system and the risk management
system as required by § 107 (3) sentence 2 AktG."
"Our risk and opportunity management system is based on the globally applicable risk management standard of the
International Standards Organization (ISO)."
"ISO standard 31000 “Risk management – Principles and guidelines” is regarded as
a guideline for internationally recognized risk management systems."

Our Internal Audit unit reviews the functionality and effectiveness of elements of our risk management system at regular
intervals."
"Our system complies with the
statutory requirements for a risk early detection system."
"In addition, our Group Controlling unit specifies a series of Group guidelines and processes for the planning, budgeting,
financial management, and reporting of investments and projects."
"These guidelines and processes are intended to guarantee
both the necessary transparency during the investment process and the consistency of investment planning and decisions in
our Group and operating segments."
They also provide the Board of Management with support in reaching its decisions.
"This
process also includes the systematic identification of strategic risks and opportunities."
"The Group Policy on Risk Management
was further refined in 2022 and adapted to the current circumstances."
"Organization of the risk and opportunity management system
The Group Risk Governance unit defines the methods for the risk and opportunity management system that is applied Group-
wide and for the associated reporting system, in particular the Group risk report."
"All operating segments as well as the Group
Headquarters & Group Services segment are connected to the central risk and opportunity management system of the Group
via their own risk and opportunity management."
"The relevant owners in each of the segments are responsible for identifying,
assessing, and continuously monitoring risks."
"Management takes potential opportunities into account in the annual planning
process and continuously develops them further during business operations."
"Our Group-wide risk and opportunity management system covers strategic, operational, regulatory, legal, compliance, and
financial risks and opportunities for our consolidated and major non-consolidated entities."
"The standard process described
below provides a framework."
"The starting point for the identification of risks and opportunities is the deviation from a planned
value or company target."
"Once risks and opportunities have been identified, we move on to analyze and assess them in more
detail."
"We then decide on the specific course of action to be taken, for example, in order to reduce risks or seize opportunities."
"The respective risk owner evaluates, implements, and monitors the associated measures."
"After taking mitigating measures into
account, these risks are summarized in the risk reporting, which is submitted to the decision-makers in the company and/or
the relevant supervisory body."
"This also enables transparent monitoring of the development of individual risks, as well as of the
overall risk situation, including the mitigation measures taken."
"Our risk culture, the manner in which we deal with risks, is a key
component and embedded in all parts of the Company."
The risk and opportunity management process is described below using five elements.
"For purposes of simplification, “risks” is
used in the following, instead of referring to “opportunities and risks” in each case."
"The document nonetheless focuses on both
positive and negative deviations from the planned value."
"Risk management is therefore always a matter of opportunity and risk
management."

Risk culture
Our risk culture includes the basic attitudes in relation to risks and forms the basis and the framework for everyday business,
for being able to make risk-oriented decisions."
"The risk culture is closely interlinked with Deutsche Telekom’s corporate culture,
which requires risks and opportunities to be dealt with in a positive and transparent way."
"At the core of our risk culture is the
motto “Everyone is a risk manager,” which means that, in principle, every employee takes responsibility for their risks, and
handles them in accordance with the defined process."
"Corporate targets
The corporate targets (or targets for the relevant individual unit derived from these) serve as the starting point for the
identification of risks as deviations from planned values."
These include both quantitative and qualitative targets.
"In order to
assess the threat to the continued existence of the Company, we implemented the concept of risk-bearing capacity."
"Risk-
bearing capacity encompasses the assets for covering possible losses."
These assets are defined through equity and liquidity.
"Risk analysis
Risk identification."
"Each segment produces a quarterly risk report or risk notification in accordance with the standards laid
down by the central risk management and based on specific materiality thresholds."
"These reports or notifications assess risks,
taking into account their extent in terms of impact on results of operations or financial position, as well as their probability of
occurrence, and they identify action to be taken and suggest or initiate measures."
"Qualitative factors affecting our strategic
positioning and reputation are taken into account."
We base our assessment of risks on a period of two years.
"This is also the
length of our forecast period."
"If significant risks exist beyond the forecast period, these are monitored and documented on an
ongoing basis."
"In addition, on an annual basis, we consider “emerging risks,” which are primarily derived from external studies."
"These are risks and opportunities that are developing at considerable pace, and in some cases are difficult to assess."
"These
risks are either new or becoming substantially more significant for our company over time."
"If relevant, other indicators are to be used for the assessment,
e.g., financial risks based on cash flow, which can also be used to assess the categories of risk."
"On the basis of our assessment using the criteria described above, we categorize the individual risks in our risk and opportunity
management process as top risks or risks under observation, as shown in the graphic below."
Top risks are managed with priority.

"Exceptions are possible, for example, risks from prior years that
we continue to list for the sake of reporting continuity although they are classified as “risk under observation” (white shading)
in the current reporting period."
"It should be noted that risks with an extent currently assessed as being small may in the future have a stronger impact than
risks currently assessed as having a larger extent."
"This may be due to uncertainties that cannot be assessed at present and over
which we have no influence."
"For the aggregate disclosure of an overall risk position, Group Risk Governance performs an “EBITDA AL at risk” and a “cash
flow at risk” calculation for Deutsche Telekom."
"This states that, with a particular probability of occurrence, the risk extent
ascertained using the simulation will not be exceeded."
"The risk aggregations are carried out using a technique that has become
known as Monte Carlo simulation, in which a large number of risk-related potential future scenarios is considered."
"The overall
risk positions are set in relation to the assets for covering possible losses."
"The risk-bearing capacity analysis is carried out once
a quarter as part of risk reporting."
Identification and assessment of opportunities in the annual planning process.
"The systematic management of risks is one
side of the coin; securing the Company’s long-term success by means of integrated opportunities management is the other."
"That is why identifying opportunities and subjecting them to a strategic and financial assessment is an essential part of our
annual planning process."
"It allows us to factor those opportunities into our forecasts for financial and non-financial performance
indicators."
"The short-term monitoring of results and the medium-term planning process help our operating segments and Group
Headquarters identify and seize the opportunities in our business throughout the year."
"While short-term monitoring of results
mainly targets opportunities for the current financial year, the medium-term planning process focuses on opportunities that
are strategically important for our Group."
"In this context we distinguish between two types of opportunity:
We are constantly enhancing the efficiency of our planning process so as to gain greater scope for action."
"The identification of opportunities from innovation and their strategic and financial assessment play a major role throughout
this process."
"This “brainstorming” may result in opportunities being taken and transferred to the organization, or rejected and
passed back to the respective working groups for revision."
"External opportunities, i.e., those with causes over which we have no influence, for example, the revocation of additional
taxes in Europe."
"Internal opportunities, i.e., those that arise within the Company, for example by focusing our organizational structure on
innovation and growth areas and products, or through business partnerships and collaborations from which we expect to
reap synergies."

Risk handling
Group insurance management."
"To the extent possible and economically viable, we take out adequate Group-wide insurance
cover for insurable risks."
"DeTeAssekuranz – a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG – acts as an insurance broker for group
insurance management."
"It develops and implements solutions for the Group’s operational risks using insurance and insurance-
related tools and places them on the national and international insurance markets."
Taking out insurance cover is an essential option for our external risk transfer.
"The coverage of risks in our Group insurance
programs requires the transfer of risk for the purpose of protecting the Group’s financial position."
"That means that the possible
extent of the risk must have reached a volume “relevant for the Group” or the risks have to be bundled and managed at Group
level to protect the Group’s interests (opportune reasons/cost optimization/risk reduction)."
Business continuity management (BCM).
"BCM is a process within operational security and risk
management that helps protect business processes from the consequences of damaging incidents and disruptions."
"It ensures
the continuation of business processes through ongoing analysis, assessment, and management of relevant risks for people,
technology, infrastructure, supply and service relationships, and information."
"The aim is to identify potential threats at an early
stage and to keep the impact and duration of a disruption of critical business processes to an acceptable minimum by ensuring
appropriate resilience in the organization plus the ability to effectively cope with threats."
"To this end, BCM identifies critical business processes and business processes requiring protection, including any supporting
processes, process steps, and assets (people, technology, infrastructure, information, and supply and service relationships)."
Appropriate precautionary measures are also defined.
"In particular, Security Management works in coordination with the
relevant units and process owners to analyze the possible consequences of external and internal threats with relevance for
security, such as natural disasters, vandalism, or sabotage."
"Once the extent of potential losses and probability of occurrence
have been assessed, preventive measures can be put in place and contingency plans developed."
Risk containment measures.
The risk owners initiate and execute further measures to mitigate the risks.
"A wide range of measures are available, depending on the risk type."
"A few examples of these measures are:
Risk monitoring
The Group risk report, which presents the major risks, is prepared for the Board of Management on a quarterly basis."
"The Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Telekom AG also examines this report at its meetings."
"Furthermore, the Board
of Management informs the Supervisory Board."
"In addition, the emerging risks are presented once a year as part of the risk
report."
"Among other benefits, the Group risk report ensures transparent monitoring of the development of individual risks, as
well as of the overall risk situation."
This is supported by the Group-wide risk management tool.
"If any unforeseen risks arise, they
are reported ad hoc (even outside of regular reporting)."
"We inform the Audit Committee about all of the latest developments
and/or changes in the risk management system at a special meeting held annually."
We tackle risks from the market environment with comprehensive sales controlling and intensive customer management.
We deal with risks arising from brand and reputation by continuously analyzing the market and communications.
"We also take a whole array of measures to deal with operational risks: for example, we constantly implement operational and
infrastructural measures in order to improve our networks, and offer our employees systematic training and development
programs."
"We deal with risks from the political and regulatory environment through an intensive, constructive dialog with policymakers
and the authorities."
"We minimize legal risks by ensuring suitable support for proceedings and by designing contracts appropriately in the first
place."
"We manage interest and currency risks by means of systematic risk management and hedge them using derivative and non-
derivative financial instruments."
"The Group Tax unit identifies potential tax-related risks at an early stage and systematically records, assesses, and monitors
them."
"It takes any measures necessary to minimize tax-related risks and coordinates them with the Group companies
affected."
The unit also draws up and communicates policies for avoiding tax risks.

"We only
consider risks and opportunities after the mitigation measures taken (net assessment)."
"If risks and opportunities can be clearly
allocated to an operating segment, this is presented accordingly in the following."
"In order to make it easier to understand and see their effects, we have assigned the individually assessed risks to the following
categories."
"Where multiple individual risks are assigned to one risk category, we calculate the risk significance on the basis of
risk aggregation carried out using a Monte Carlo simulation, in which we consider the individual risks along with their individual
extent and probability of occurrence."
"The outcome, or risk significance, is the “value at risk.” This states that, with a particular
probability of occurrence, the risk extent ascertained using the simulation will not be exceeded."
"An expert assessment is used
for risk categories that have not been quantified."
"As an international corporation, we operate in a large

Uncertainty over the global economic outlook remains high."
"The war in Ukraine and/or the conflict in the Middle East could
intensify and further drive up energy and food prices."
"War-related embargoes could push up energy prices further and lead to
supply shortages, especially for our Germany and Europe operating segments."
"China’s central role for global supply and value
chains also poses a risk."
Greater geoeconomic fragmentation poses the risk of increased distortions and political uncertainty.
"If the crisis in the Chinese real estate sector intensifies, it could further slow economic growth in China, with potential cross-
border effects."
"Current high interest rates are expected to lead to a downturn in economic growth in the United States in
2024."
"In Europe too, the impact of companies, households, and state finances adapting to the high-interest environment could
prove more severe than expected."
"Germany could see recession again in 2024 as a result of declining business investments on
account of poor conditions in global trade and budgetary consolidation."
"A rise in company insolvencies could have a negative
impact on our business customer segment."
"A potential decrease in household income could trigger migration to lower-cost
rate plans in the consumer segment, as well as larger numbers of customers defaulting on payments."
"Additional risks could
result from other geopolitical conflicts, for instance between China and Taiwan, and the uncertainty from international trade
conflicts."
"Furthermore, extreme risks with a high impact of loss and a very low probability of occurrence could in principle
have a substantial impact on the global economy and our business."
"Examples of these are extensive extreme weather events
(e.g., tsunamis, solar storms), disruptive new technologies, further armed conflicts, or new pandemics."
These risks are counterbalanced by opportunities.
"In particular, the economy could perform better than expected, if inflation
declines faster and benchmark interest rates are lowered sooner than expected."
Risks from the market environment.
"The main market risks we face include the steadily falling profitability of voice and data
services in the fixed network and in mobile communications."
"In addition to price reductions imposed by regulatory authorities,
this is primarily attributable to ongoing intense competition in the telecommunications industry."
"Competitive pressure is expected to continue, especially in the fixed network in Germany and the countries of our Europe
operating segment."
"In the broadband market, the trend of disproportionate growth in the market shares of regional network
operators and supra-regional specialist FTTH providers, particularly in Germany, continues to establish itself."
"They build out
their own infrastructure and thus increase their market coverage thereby increasing their customer numbers and expanding
their own value added."
"There is still strong competition to gain new customers by cutting prices and offering introductory
discounts."
"We expect ongoing price pressure for mobile voice telephony and mobile data services, which could adversely affect our
mobile service revenues."
"Among the main reasons for this price pressure are data-centric, aggressively priced offers."
"Providers
that do not have their own infrastructure (MVNOs) market such offers over the internet, for instance, while there is also the
risk that smaller competitors will take unforeseen, aggressive pricing measures."
"Technological innovations could put further
pressure on prices by increasing the willingness of customers to switch providers."
"Another competitive risk lies in the fact that, both in the fixed network and in mobile communications, we are increasingly faced
with competitors who are not part of the telecommunications sector as such, but are increasingly moving into the traditional
telecommunications markets."
This mainly relates to major players in the internet and consumer electronics industries.
"As a
result, we are exposed to the risk of a further loss of share of value added and falling margins due to increasingly losing direct
customer contact to competitors."
T‑Mobile US is active in a market environment that is characterized by intensive competition.
"Alongside traditional
telecommunications providers that deliver bundled offerings including content and mobile video services, there is additional
competition, as mobile, fixed-network, and satellite industries increasingly converge."
"Additionally, potential market saturation
in the United States may cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to decline in comparison with previous years."
"The industry is also highly competitive in spectrum positions, which are crucial to improving existing offerings and introducing
new services."
"T‑Mobile US, through its strategic acquisition of spectrum, enabled the capabilities to offer high-speed internet."
High-speed internet allows our U.S.
"subsidiary to offer its own access product and provide a basis on which to continue
the business with bundled offerings."
"Furthermore, T‑Mobile US continues to develop and maintain strategic partnerships and
MVNO relationships."
"T‑Mobile US must continue to successfully refine and implement its market strategy as Value Leader,
Customer Service Leader, and 5G Network Leader to attract and maintain private and business customers."
"Increasing
competitive pressure due to attractive bundle offers and device promotions could lead to difficulty in achieving targets in terms
of business, financial, and operating results in the future."
"Furthermore, social instability may cause protests or demonstrations
that could escalate and lead to business disruptions such as store closures or inventory theft."

Innovation cycles are getting shorter and shorter."
"This confronts the telecommunications sector with the challenge of bringing
out new products and services at shorter and shorter intervals."
"New technologies are superseding existing technologies,
products, or services in part, in some cases even completely."
"This could lead to lower prices and revenues in relation to the
services offered, such as telephony, internet access, or television – right through to full substitution by new, global providers."
These substitution risks could impact our revenue and earnings.
"We deal with the impact of substitution risks by, for example,
offering integrated solutions with hyper-personalization, contextualization, and consistent interoperability of our products, in
order to “turn customers into fans” and thereby secure their loyalty."
"In terms of building out fiber-optic networks, more and
more new competitors are entering into the markets, which could lead to longer payback periods for all market players."
"A
strategic rivalry is growing between the “West” (predominantly the United States) and the “East” (predominantly China), which
could accelerate various technological areas (e.g., the further development of standards for telecommunications networks)."
Our Systems Solutions operating segment also faces challenges.
"Continued strong competition and persistent cost pressure
are adversely affecting traditional IT business."
"In addition, the technological shift toward cloud solutions and digitalization in
the IT sector is prompting strongly capitalized competitors to enter the market."
"This might lead to revenue losses and declining
margins at T‑Systems."
Opportunities from the market environment.
"The telecommunications and IT market is extremely dynamic and highly
competitive."
"The economic and competition conditions as well as customers’ changing wants and needs affect our actions and
impact on our Company indicators."
"We generally expect the situation to develop as described in the section “Forecast.”
Apart from the risks described, there is the possibility that our customers could move to higher-value rate plans since the data
volume of the applications used is rising steadily."
"Likewise, further growth could be generated by tapping into new customer
segments, especially in the United States (e.g., for business customers and small and medium-sized enterprises)."
"In addition,
ever-shorter innovation cycles could enable us to drive the digital transformation of our society and to provide our consumers
and business customers with innovative products and solutions."
"That is why, with the growing convergence of networks, IT, and
products, our innovation and technology activities are decisive when it comes to identifying opportunities and making the most
of them in an increasingly competitive environment."
"Hence, our Technology and Innovation Board of Management department
has joined all relevant functions under a common leadership to ensure a close integration of technology, innovation, IT, and
security."
"By doing so, we are putting the development of human-centered solutions and outstanding,
seamless customer experiences front and center, and in the reporting year we won multiple awards, for example, for our digital
assistant Frag Magenta."
5G enables increased requirements for existing business models to be managed more cost-efficiently going forward.
"In
addition, it offers opportunities for further business models, by marketing improved network capabilities (e.g., network access,
localization, security, identity, storage location, temporary storage) to relevant partners."
"We have already implemented many
use cases with 5G, such as 5G campus networks, applications for extended reality (XR), and support for autonomous driving."
"Together with other technologies like the NarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), 5G provides
the underpinnings for the further digital transformation of society."
"Furthermore, opportunities for new project business are arising in our systems solutions business from data sovereignty,
innovation areas such as AI, and industrial IoT initiatives."
Risks relating to strategic implementation and integration.
"We are in a continuous process of strategic
adjustments and cost-cutting initiatives."
"If we are unable to implement these projects as planned, we will be exposed to certain
risks."
"In other words, the benefit of the measures could be less than originally estimated, take effect later than expected, or not
at all."
"Each of these factors, individually or in combination, could have a negative impact on our business situation, financial
position, and results of operations."
"As a part of the business combination of T‑Mobile US and Sprint, numerous commitments were made to secure approvals."
Most commitments have been accomplished.
"Nevertheless, should any remaining commitments not be achieved, litigation or
financial consequences could be a result."
"In the United States, growth opportunities in the wireless business are becoming
more difficult and expensive due to market saturation."
"Non-core and emerging businesses may be relied on to continue
subscriber growth."
"T‑Mobile US is currently integrating, upgrading, and replacing many existing applications and systems,
including numerous legacy systems from previous acquisitions."
"This process is complex and involves challenges in integrating
and modernizing outdated IT infrastructure within a limited time frame."
"The success of these efforts depends on the effective
allocation of resources, expansion of our development capabilities, leveraging artificial intelligence and emerging technologies,
and ensuring access to subject-matter experts."
"150
satisfactory customer and employee experiences."
"These issues could also hinder the capacity to meet customer expectations
in terms of service capabilities and offerings, potentially affecting T‑Mobile US’ operational, financial, and reputational
standing."
Collaboration with Chinese suppliers is being impeded by the enduring trade conflict between the United States and China.
"Since 2020, the United States has restricted the use of U.S."
"technology for and by Chinese suppliers on account of security
concerns."
They also put pressure on other countries to do the same.
"In Germany, the legislator adopted the Second Act to
Increase the Security of Information Technology Systems, or the IT Security Act 2.0 (IT-Sicherheitsgesetz 2.0), in 2021."
"All 5G
operators must notify the authorities of new critical components and the suppliers thereof in accordance with the catalog of
security requirements pursuant to the Telecommunications Act and prior to first-time operation."
"If the Federal Government
has security concerns, it can introduce a blanket ban on using certain manufacturers."
"Deutsche Telekom itself has long been
scrutinizing security-critical components prior to installation and on an ongoing basis once in operation."
"In 2023, under the
IT Security Act 2.0, the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community (BMI) asked German network operators to identify
all 5G components from the Chinese suppliers Huawei and ZTE that have already been installed, and to notify the authority
accordingly."
"Although BMI speaks of an impartial review, there is public speculation over the possibility that, in Germany, in
2024, the findings could lead to a ban or restrictions on deploying Chinese equipment in parts of the network, within certain
time frames."
"In other countries, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland, it is still possible that components from
critical infrastructure suppliers will have to be replaced within specific deadlines."
"Compared to 2022, we have raised the risk
significance of the risk category “Strategic implementation and integration” from high to very high, due to the extensive costs
that could be incurred should there be a retrospective order to remove components."
Opportunities relating to strategic implementation and integration.
"In our Magenta Advantage
strategic area of operation, we work with partners to develop new digital business models based on our assets or capabilities."
These partnerships provide opportunities for us to increase revenue and strengthen customer loyalty on a sustainable basis.
"Since the start of 2022, we have offered our customers exclusive products, services, and benefits as part of our loyalty program
Magenta Moments in the OneApp."
"Cooperations with partner firms like booking.com, Rituals, Netflix, Disney+, and Octopus
Energy are a key component of our activities and will play an even more crucial role going forwards in light of the pan-European
expansion of our loyalty measures in Europe."
"The completed IP transformation (all IP) laid the foundations for the cloud- and software-based production of networks and
services."
"It creates opportunities to increase efficiency, accelerate the provision of new services and features, improve quality,
and tap into new revenue potential, while at the same time increasing automation."
"As we
simultaneously drive forward automation and cloudification, we also expect a reduction in total costs and an increase in agility
and speed in the provision of new services and features."
"We are driving forward the transformation of our IT using agile development, decoupling, and cloudification."
"These approaches
enable us to tap into new possibilities for accelerating developments and increasing the efficiency of IT production, by
providing modular components, known as microservices, and APIs and producing them in a scalable cloud with state-of-the-art
technology."
"Furthermore, agile and decoupled development makes it possible to reduce big bang risks in the delivery of major
software releases by means of smaller, flexible software releases."
Risks and opportunities arising from brand and reputation.
"An unforeseeable negative media report on our products and
services or our corporate activities and responsibilities may have a huge impact on the reputation of our Company and our
brand image."
Social networks may make it possible that such information and opinions can spread much faster and more widely.
"Ultimately, negative reports may impact on our revenue and our brand value."
"In order to avoid this, we engage in a constant,
intensive, and constructive dialog, in particular with our customers, the media, and the financial world."
"For us, the top priority
is to take as balanced a view as possible of the interests of all stakeholders and thereby uphold our reputation as a reliable
partner."

Risks and opportunities relating to sustainability and social responsibility."
"For us, comprehensive risk and opportunity
management also means considering the opportunities and risks arising from ecological or social aspects or from the
management of our Company."
"To this end, we actively and systematically involve all relevant stakeholders in the process so as
to identify current and potential risks and opportunities along our entire value chain."
"In parallel with our ongoing monitoring
of ecological, social, and governance issues, we systematically determine our stakeholders’ positions on these issues."
"We also integrate the biggest sustainability
risks in our internal compliance assessment, thereby recording the associated positioning and development of measures in the
various business areas."
"For further information on sustainability, please refer to the section “Combined non-financial statement.”
We have identified the following as our main sustainability management issues:
Reputation."
How we deal with sustainability issues also entails both opportunities and risks for our reputation.
"A high level
of service quality is one of the most important factors for improving customer perception."
"Customer satisfaction has been
embedded in our Group management as a non-financial performance indicator to underline the importance of this issue."
Transparency and reporting help to promote the trust of other external stakeholders in our Group.
"Our annual and CR reports
also serve this purpose."
"As part of our sustainability management activities, we continuously review such potential risks and take
mitigation measures to minimize them."
"This includes systematically incorporating them in the Group’s internal compliance
management system, so as to determine the relevance of the risks in relation to sustainability issues and their effect on
reputation across units."
"We also ascertain how our products and services make a positive contribution to sustainability in
order to enhance our reputation."
"We pursue an integrated climate strategy, which means focusing not only on the
risks that climate change poses for us and our stakeholders, but also on the opportunities it presents."
"By 2030, ICT products
and services will have the potential to save up to seven times as much in CO2 emissions in other industries as the growth
in the ICT sector itself will generate, even taking into account the expected rebound effects (according to the GeSI Digital
for Purpose study)."
"Taking an optimistic view, this could mean a 9 % reduction in global CO2 emissions by 2030."
"In addition,
investments of around USD 3 trillion in innovative solutions are expected by 2030, which will not only expand the business,
but will also support the SDGs."
"We are supporting this trend by evaluating our product portfolio to identify sustainability
benefits."
"In addition, we want to continuously improve the ratio of the emissions that our products and services save to those
generated by our own value chain and report on our corresponding successes using an enablement factor."
Climate change risks are already visible in the form of increasingly extreme weather conditions.
"Such storm events could
damage our infrastructure and disrupt network operation."
"This would have a direct effect on our stakeholders, e.g., our
customers, suppliers, and employees, and could result in revenue losses or lower customer satisfaction."
"The risk is assessed
in relation to the continuation of operations as part of risk management and is managed at an operational level in the business
units."
"Deutsche Telekom welcomes the targets behind the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and is
actively working to implement them."
"In a first step, we conducted a gap analysis on the coverage of TCFD recommendations."
"In a number of workshops with relevant players from technology, procurement, strategy, and risk management, we defined
Deutsche Telekom AG’s key climate-related opportunities and risks and gave them an initial weighting."
"In addition to the physical risks, transitory risks (threats arising from
sudden adaptations to climate change made by economic sectors) were also analyzed in detail by means of a workshop."
"The
full roll-out of the climate risk analysis and the measurement of vulnerability are set to follow in 2024."
We will publish detailed information on this in our 2023 CR Report.

"Mobile communications, or the electromagnetic fields used in mobile communications,
regularly give rise to concerns among the general population about potential health risks."
"This issue continues to be the
subject of public, political, and scientific debate."
"Acceptance problems among the general public mostly concern mobile
communications networks and occasionally the use of mobile terminals such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops."
"The
discussion has intensified repercussions for the build-out of the mobile infrastructure."
"In the fixed network, this could affect
the use of traditional IP and DECT (digital cordless) phones, and devices that use Wi-Fi technology."
"There is a risk of regulatory
interventions, such as tightened thresholds for electromagnetic fields or the implementation of precautionary measures in
mobile communications, e.g., amendments to building law, or also the risk of a labeling requirement for handsets."
(Inter)national expert organizations will continue to regularly review the recommended thresholds.
We are convinced that mobile communications technology is safe if specific threshold values are complied with.
"We are
supported in this conviction by the assessment of the recognized bodies."
"Our responsible approach to this issue finds
expression in our Group-wide EMF Policy, with which we commit ourselves to more transparency, information, participation,
and scientific facts, far beyond that which is stipulated by legal requirements."
"We aim to overcome concerns among the general
public by pursuing an objective, scientifically well-founded, and transparent information policy."
"We thus continue to see it
as our duty to continue our trust-based dialog with local authorities and to ensure its successful progress."
"This particularly
applies since our long-standing collaboration with municipalities to expand the mobile network was enshrined in law in 2013."
"Previously, this collaboration was based on voluntary self-commitments by the network operators."
We can take further preventive action in this area by also reducing our own CO2 emissions.
"For this reason, in 2021 we set
ourselves the ambitious target of cutting our CO2 emissions across the Group (Scope 1 and 2) to net zero by 2025."
"Up to 95 %
of these emissions will be actually cut."
Any remaining emissions will be offset through compensatory measures.
"Climate
protection also carries financial risks, whether from the introduction of levies on CO2 emissions or increased energy costs,
as well as stricter requirements for products, for example in relation to energy efficiency."
"The mitigation measures we are
taking to counter these risks include measuring our own energy efficiency and finding ways to improve it."
"Our ESG targets
agreed from 2021 for Board of Management remuneration in relation to the respective annual energy consumption as well as
the planned annual CO2 emissions for Scope 1 and 2 also contribute to achieving the climate targets and energy efficiency
measures."
"We have a Group-wide program to specifically address our supply chain and we are working to optimize our
products and their packaging."
"Since 2021, the Group has covered 100 % of its electricity requirement with renewable energy."
"This is achieved through power purchase agreements and other forms of direct purchase, such as through guarantees of
origin."
"For further information on this, please refer to the section “Combined non-financial statement.”
Due

(Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG))."
"In 2022 and 2023, we reviewed and extended our
human rights and environment-related due diligence processes, among others, in order to better accommodate new legal
requirements, such as those arising from the LkSG."
"As part of our global procurement activities in particular, we could be
exposed to country- and supplier-specific risks."
"These include, for example, inadequate local working and safety conditions."
"Violations could cause severe damage to those affected and could result in reputational damage and negative financial
consequences for companies."
"Our LkSG risk management system includes due diligence processes directed at identifying
risks or also violations related to human rights and environmental concerns and, building on this, taking appropriate
preventive and/or corrective measures."
"It encompasses our own business areas, i.e., all Group companies over which
Deutsche Telekom exercises a decisive influence (which in particular does not apply to T‑Mobile US), and our direct and
indirect suppliers."
"The LkSG risk management system is linked with various established risk processes in the Group, e.g., with
the compliance risk assessment of our compliance management system."
"The annual risk analysis for Group companies
belonging to our own business areas and their direct suppliers is a central component of the LkSG risk management system."
"In addition, ad hoc risk assessments are carried out for the entire value chain, for example, before acquisitions."
"In order
to monitor the effective functioning of the LkSG risk management system, Deutsche Telekom AG has defined the roles of
human rights officer and LkSG officer, which will be exercised by the Vice President for Group Corporate Responsibility."
"This person reports directly to the Chair of the Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG and has further supporting
functions."
"Where required to under national regulations (e.g., under the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply
Chains (LkSG)), Group companies have appointed monitoring roles in the same form for their business areas."
We will publish detailed information on the results of the annual risk analysis in our 2023 CR Report and in our 2023 LkSG Report.

Operational risks and opportunities
Risks arising from technology."
"We have an increasingly complex information/network technology (IT/NT) infrastructure, which
we constantly expand and upgrade to ensure the best customer experience and consolidate our technology leadership."
"Outages in the current and also future technical infrastructure cannot be completely ruled out and could in individual cases
result in revenue losses or increased costs."
"After all, our IT/NT resources and structures are the key organizational and technical
platform for our operations."
The ongoing convergence of IT and NT harbors risks.
"In order to counter these holistically, our
technology, innovation, IT, and security activities are combined under the Board of Management department for Technology
and Innovation."
Risks could arise in this area relating to all IT/NT systems and products that require internet access.
"For instance, faults between
newly developed and existing IT/NT systems could cause interruptions to business processes, products, and services, such
as smartphones and MagentaTV, or to connectivity for business customers."
"In order to avoid the risk of outages, e.g., due to
natural disasters or fires, we use technical early warning systems and redundant IT/NT systems."
"The Computer Emergency
Response Team (CERT) at Deutsche Telekom Security is in charge of protecting our business customers’ IT infrastructure and
applications."
"In cloud computing, all data and applications are stored at a data center."
"Our European data centers have security
certification and meet strict data protection provisions and the EU regulations."
"All data relating to companies and private
persons is protected from external access."
"Constant maintenance and automatic updates keep the security precautions up
to date at all times."
"On the basis of a standardized Group-wide business continuity management (BCM) process, we also take
organizational and technical measures to prevent damage from occurring or, if we cannot, to mitigate the subsequent effects."
We also have insurance cover for insurable risks.
"T‑Mobile US relies upon its systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers, to provide
and support services."
"If
T‑Mobile US is unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, then it may experience a decline in
demand for its services or face challenges in implementing or evolving its business strategy."
Opportunities arising from technology.
"The utilization of large data volumes (big data) from our networks and their analysis
using artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) can improve and speed up decision-making processes by enhancing
transparency."
"It does so by shifting the basis for decisions from hypotheses to facts and, for example, enabling correlations to
be recognized."
"In this way, ML can be used, for example, to manage the energy consumption of our technology in a forward-
looking way based on the analysis of network data."
"Our Systems Solutions operating segment covers innovative business areas in the digital transformation of business processes,
such as cloud computing, AI, automation, and cybersecurity."
These business areas could develop faster than expected.
"As a
pioneer of the digital transformation, we have an opportunity to actively shape market trends through a variety of projects in
the fields of healthcare, public administration, and the automotive segment."
"Under these data-based digital business models,
our partner-oriented approach is a highly promising way of contributing our core competencies – in cloud computing, edge
computing, and cybersecurity – to various projects."
"In addition, we have references regarding strategic engagements in our
focal sectors."
We also see potential for development in the sovereign clouds environment.
"As a technology and development partner for toll collection business in Europe, we already have a strong competitive position."
"We have earned valuable references in European toll collection projects in Belgium and Austria and through the launch of a
Europe-wide toll collection system (Toll4Europe)."
This will help to give us an edge over our competitors.
Procurement and supply risks.
"Deutsche Telekom cooperates with a large number of suppliers of technical (information and
communication technology) and non-technical products and services."
"Products and services that might involve a higher risk
include software and hardware, network technology components, and all products and services provided directly to end
customers."
"To our shareholders

Deutsche Telekom."
"154
Deutsche Telekom’s supply chains could be disrupted by a number of factors, such as geopolitical tensions, (e.g., the United
States’ technology sanctions against China), cyberattacks, or supply chain restructuring."
"Furthermore, additional risks may also
result from the dependence on individual suppliers or from individual vendors defaulting."
"This applies in particular for Chinese
suppliers of telecommunications technology."
"We employ organizational, contractual, and procurement strategy measures to
counteract these challenges."
"At T‑Mobile US, in certain areas such as terminal equipment, there are few suppliers who can
provide adequate support, which may lead to unfavorable contract terms and decreased flexibility to switch to alternative third
parties."
"Unexpected termination or difficulties in renewing the commercial arrangements with the suppliers, or any business
disruptions at the suppliers could have a material adverse effect on T‑Mobile US."
"We are therefore raising the risk significance
of the risk category “Procurement and suppliers” from low to medium."
"Risks and opportunities arising from data privacy and data security
Data privacy."
"All Group companies are subject to specific data privacy regulations (in the EU especially the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR))."
These requirements must be implemented and their compliance must be monitored.
"Data
privacy incidents could be sanctioned with very high administrative fines (up to between 2 and 4 % of the total worldwide
annual revenue of an undertaking)."
The European supervisory authorities’ concept for administrative fines would apply.
"It
stipulates high fines even for violations with a low criticality."
"The supervisory authorities’ practice with respect to fines
demonstrates that more and higher fines are being imposed."
"Despite mitigation measures and well-established data privacy
management structures, it is not possible to fundamentally rule out data privacy incidents as almost all procedures/processes
in the Group are relevant in terms of data protection."
"Errors might occur that are linked to reputation, cost, and sanction risks."
"Since the introduction of the GDPR, data privacy law has been largely harmonized in Europe."
"Deutsche Telekom benefits
from this as a Group, since the majority of special national data privacy regulations no longer apply and no longer have to
be implemented in the individual entities in the European Union (EU)."
This has reduced the need for additional coordination.
An appropriate level of security is also ensured when transmitting personal data to countries outside of the EU.
"Under
the Schrems II ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from 2020, companies are subject to strict requirements for
the transmission of data to third countries without the adequacy decision of the EU Commission, compliance with which
entails a substantial workload for companies."
Deutsche Telekom therefore welcomes the EU-U.S.
"Data Privacy Framework
agreed between the EU and the United States, which is intended to provide greater legal certainty for collaborations with
U.S."
A number of actions are pending against this agreement and more have been announced.
"By way of mitigation,
Deutsche Telekom safeguards the transmission of personal data to companies in the United States, regardless of final legal
clarification, by means of standard contractual clauses of the European Commission."
"In the United States, the telecommunications industry is also examined closely by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with regards to the state data privacy laws."
"Non-compliance with the
stricter data privacy laws could result in high fines."
"The growing demand for data means the challenges with respect to the
collection, usage, transfer, and management of customers’ personal data are also growing."
"Deutsche Telekom carefully examines technical developments and digital transformation projects on an ongoing basis to verify
if they are in line with the Group strategy."
"For example, the use of IT systems with AI within the Group always complies with
the applicable data privacy laws and provisions."
"The Privacy and Security Assessment (PSA) must be carried out as soon as
a new AI solution is to be introduced in the Group."
"This process, which is now fully digital, meets the requirements of the
GDPR with regard to carrying out a Privacy Impact Assessment for evaluating and documenting the risks posed by data
processing."
"In the PSA process all data privacy and security requirements relevant to the system or project are automatically
assigned and then worked through by the functionally responsible units."
"One new addition is the separate AI data privacy
requirement, which helps to develop systems based on or using AI in a way that is data privacy-compliant."
"This takes account
not only of general data privacy principles (legality, transparency, limitation of use, etc.), but also specific application scenarios,
such as generative AI and profiling."
"These data privacy requirements also take an important first step in preparing for the
European AI Act (EU AI Act)."
"Since the ePrivacy Regulation has still not yet been adopted, there is yet another sector-specific regulatory challenge for the
telecommunications sector in the EU."
"Another example of a major initiative with relevance for data privacy is the long-term partnership between T‑Systems and
Google Cloud, which began in 2021."
"In operation since April 2022, the shared T‑Systems Sovereign Cloud powered by Google
Cloud combines the open-source expertise of Google Cloud and the sovereign services of T‑Systems and enables customers
to manage their workloads in full compliance with German and EU regulatory requirements."

Prior thereto, T‑Systems signed the EU Cloud Code of Conduct (EU Cloud CoC) in 2021."
"After all, the EU Cloud is synonymous
with something essential, namely, nothing less than the digital sovereignty of Europe in cloud services."
"This refers to the
complete control of stored and processed data and independent decision-making on who can access the data."
"This requires
clear rules and requirements, which the EU Cloud CoC offers."
"The European data protection authorities authorized this Code
of Conduct."
"By becoming a signatory, the Company and hence also T‑Systems undertakes to continue to increase the data
protection level for cloud services in the interests of customers and European data protection."
"In this way they provide
proof that data is processed in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR."
"Compliance with the rules is reviewed by an
independent body."
"We will continue to support the development of the standard in 2024 and ensure further harmonization with
ISO and internal standards."
IT security continues to pose major challenges.
"In addition to preventive measures such as integrated security in
business processes and measures to raise security awareness among employees, we counter these challenges with increased
focus on the analysis of threats and cyber risks."
"This is where our early warning system comes in: It detects new sources
and types of cyberattack, analyzes the behavior of the attackers while maintaining strict data privacy, and identifies new
trends in the field of security."
"Along with the honeypot systems, which simulate vulnerabilities in IT systems, our early warning
system includes alerts and analytical tools for spam mails, viruses, and Trojans."
"We exchange the information we obtain
from all these systems with public and private bodies to detect new attack patterns and develop new protection systems."
"We are also currently seeing new developments in the increased and fast-growing use of generative
AI, both on the part of criminal attackers and in terms of options for protection."
"Here, too, we are working to exploit the
opportunities offered by the development and use of AI and to counter the potential new risks arising from this technology."
"Cybercrime and industrial espionage are on the rise and they are becoming ever more complex due to rapidly advancing
technologies and attack methods."
"As a result, we face constant challenges and adjustments to protect our customer and
business partner data, as well as our networks, technologies, products, and services against these attacks."
"Such incidents can
lead, among other implications, to business disruptions, embezzlement, or unauthorized access to confidential or personal
information, and to loss of reputation."
"We are addressing this development with comprehensive mitigation measures, such
as security concepts."
"In order to also create greater transparency and thus be in a stronger position to tackle these threats,
we are relying more and more on partnerships, e.g., with public and private organizations."
"By means of
the Security by Design principle, we have made security an integral part of our development process for new products and
information systems."
"Furthermore, we carry out intensive and obligatory digital security tests."
We are continually striving to accelerate our growth through IT security solutions.
"To this end, we have combined our security
units within Deutsche Telekom Security."
"We want to leverage this end-to-end security portfolio to secure market shares and
score points with security concepts on the back of megatrends like the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0."
"We are also
continuing to gradually expand our partner ecosystem in the area of cybersecurity."
We provide regular updates on the latest developments in data protection and data security on our website.
"Other operational risks and opportunities
Employees."
Our employees play a crucial role in the transformation of Deutsche Telekom.
"Their skills are a key factor in our
business success."
"Both this success and our service provision are dependent on the ability to acquire, retain, and develop
specialist staff and talents."
Sharply rising entry-level salaries could exacerbate the situation and increase costs further.
"The availability of
staff with an appropriate skill set at nearshore and offshore sites is crucial when it comes to rendering services on budget, in
line with requirements, and on time."
The demands of the talents with regard to potential employers have also increased.
"Apart
from remuneration, factors they care about include flexible working, environmental social governance, culture, diversity, and
innovations."
"We systematically work to address these challenges head on, for example, by strengthening Deutsche Telekom
and T‑Mobile US as an attractive employer brand and by proactively seeking out new specialist staff and talents worldwide."
"To our shareholders

Deutsche Telekom."
"156
In 2023, we once again used socially responsible measures to restructure the workforce in our Group."
"Early retirement models
such as phased and dedicated retirement, and severance payments have been largely taken up, but also the training and
placement of civil servants and employees in the public sector by the next.JOB unit has proved very popular."
"The
transformation with the associated staff restructuring is extremely important for achieving the Group’s goals."
"Nevertheless, it
is essential the restructuring is managed in a targeted way."
"That is why, for each request by an employee to take up a staff
reduction instrument, it must be ensured on principle that the arrangement is voluntary on both sides (agreed by employee and
manager), so as to avoid, for example, the loss of high performers."
"The Company still employs numerous civil servants, who originally belonged to Group units of Deutsche Telekom that have
since been sold."
"Where requested, these civil servants have been granted temporary leave from their civil servant status."
"However, there is a risk that they may return to us from a sold entity, for instance after the end of their temporary leave from
civil servant status, without the Company being able to offer them jobs."
"Currently, 1,041 civil servants are entitled to return from
outside the Group in this way (as of December 31, 2023), thus posing a risk."
"Risks and opportunities relating to regulation
In the following section, we describe the main regulatory risks and opportunities that, as things currently stand, could affect
our results of operations and financial position, and our reputation."
"Regulatory risks arise from telecommunications-specific statutory regulations at the national, European, and U.S."
"level, and
from the consequent powers of national authorities to regulate or intervene in the market and limit our freedom as regards
product design and pricing."
Deregulation can give rise to regulatory opportunities.
"Regulatory intervention, which we can only
anticipate to a limited extent, may exacerbate existing price and competitive pressure."
"There are concerns that regulation in
the United States, Germany, and other European countries may also impact revenue and earnings trends in the medium to long
term."
"Changes in regulatory policy and legislation
European legislation constantly influences our pricing and product design."
"The main legal frameworks are the European
Electronic Communications Code (EECC) and the EU Roaming Regulation."
"Further legislative initiatives are expected at a
European level in 2024, such as the plans to adopt the Gigabit Infrastructure Act, which aims to reduce the costs of
infrastructure build-out."
"It is also possible that the regulation of charges for phone calls between EU member states will be
extended or tightened."
The current regulation only applies until mid-2024.
"Policy decisions can give rise to risks, but also opportunities."
"The Federal Government’s Digital Strategy adopted in August
2022 is a first step for potential further measures, for example, in connection with digitalization projects in administration or
a modern legal framework for the data economy."
"The Gigabit Strategy contained therein aims, among other goals, to ensure
nationwide fiber-optic coverage and state-of-the-art mobile technology."
"To this end, measures are expected in relation to
approval processes or the realignment of the subsidized build-out, which could significantly affect conditions for the continued
network build-out."
"However, there is skepticism in the industry about the legislative proposals so far set out by the Federal
Government in this regard and progress is expected to be tentative."
"In view of the highly topical debates regarding the network security of critical infrastructure, the legislator has already
announced adjustments in this regard, which will be implemented by regulatory and other authorities."
"This will lead to new
requirements, for which the costs of implementation for Deutsche Telekom are not yet possible to estimate."
"In the United States, too, new or amended wireless-related provisions and laws can increase the complexity of processes and
lead to higher costs for T‑Mobile US."

"Inappropriate
conditions for the awarding of spectrum can include, for example, extensive build-out requirements and, in some cases,
requirements to grant network access (national roaming, service provider access)."
"The specific details are down to the national
regulatory authorities."
"By contrast, we see an opportunity in particular in the fact that such spectrum award procedures enable
mobile network operators to obtain the optimum amount of spectrum for their future business."
"We would thus be equipped
for further growth and innovation."
Changes to award procedures generally entail opportunities and risks.
"The upcoming
award procedures mainly relate to the auctioning of spectrum in the 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz,
3,400 to 3,800 MHz, and the 26,000 MHz ranges."
"In addition, spectrum licenses, especially in the 2,100 MHz and 2,600 MHz
ranges, will expire by 2024 in some countries and need to be renewed."
"Major award procedures are currently being prepared,
primarily in Austria, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic."
"In Germany, consultations were held regarding the 800 MHz,
1,800 MHz (partial), and 2,600 MHz bands to determine which award procedure to select (auction or extension) and the
possible conditions of allocation."
"Up for discussion are, among other aspects, a potential tightening of the rules for network
access in favor of service providers, and additional coverage obligations."
"The extension periods under discussion are for
five or eight years."
A final decision on this has not yet been made.
"In the United States, T‑Mobile US acquired frequency in
the 2.5 GHz range for approx."
"USD 300 million in an auction that ended on August 29, 2022."
"The receipt of these licenses
was delayed after the FCC’s authority concerning the organization of spectrum auctions had expired."
"However, on
December 19, 2023, the 5G Sale Act, which had shortly before been adopted by the U.S."
"Congress, entered into force, which
granted the FCC 90 days from that date to allocate the licenses to T‑Mobile US."
"Our Group companies in Germany and Europe continue to be subject to extensive regulation of wholesale products, obligating
us to make our network and services available to our competitors wherever we are deemed to have significant market power
as an operator."
"The national regulators regularly check and determine the corresponding terms, conditions, and prices of these
wholesale offerings."
"The key wholesale products subject to regulation are unbundled local loop lines, bitstream products,
leased lines, and the associated services."
"In July 2022, the Bundesnetzagentur published its decision on the future regulation of access to Deutsche Telekom’s copper
and fiber-optic network."
"With this decision, rules for FTTB/H networks are laid down, the previous regulation for Layer2
(VDSL) is discontinued, and access to ducts and poles is also imposed."
"The precise access conditions will be set down in the
subsequent procedures, by means of which the authority will influence Deutsche Telekom’s pricing and product design."
"For further information, please refer to the section “Major regulatory decisions.”
Regulatory requirements for mobile communications could arise from conditions imposed in connection with the allocation
of frequencies."
"In Germany, a negotiation obligation for wholesale access has been in place since 2018, for which the
Bundesnetzagentur can be called upon in cases of dispute."
"This can give rise to restrictions on our freedom of contract when
concluding wholesale agreements with regards to wholesale customers, as well as in terms of scope of services and prices."
"Within the scope of the subsidized network build-out, companies have an obligation to ensure access to the subsidized
network."
"In addition, all operators of public supply networks have an obligation, among others, to ensure shared use of passive
network infrastructure."
The Bundesnetzagentur can be called on to settle disputes.
"Since 2021, termination rates have been
determined directly by the European Commission by way of a delegated act."
"In addition, European and national consumer
protection regulations apply."
"In addition to the requirements of telecommunications law, our media products are also subject to special European and
national regulations under media law, as well as non-sector specific regulations such as data and consumer protection."
"These
include, in the broader sense, copyright law, regulations concerning the responsibility for published content, requirements in
relation to ensuring the protection of minors in the media, and requirements in relation to the content and user interfaces of
media distribution platforms."

Litigation and anti-trust proceedings
Major ongoing legal proceedings
Deutsche Telekom is party to proceedings both in and out of court with government agencies, competitors, and other parties."
The proceedings listed below are of particular importance from our perspective.
"If, in extremely rare cases, required disclosures
on individual legal proceedings are not made, we concluded that these disclosures may seriously undermine the outcome of
the relevant proceedings."
"Prospectus liability proceedings (third public offering, or DT3)."
"This relates to initially around 2,600 ongoing lawsuits from
some 16,000 alleged buyers of T-Shares sold on the basis of the prospectus published on May 26, 2000."
"The plaintiffs
assert that individual figures given in this prospectus were inaccurate or incomplete."
"The amount originally in dispute totaled
approximately EUR 78 million plus interest."
"Some of the actions are also directed at KfW and/or the Federal Republic of
Germany as well as the banks that handled the issuances."
"The Frankfurt/Main Regional Court had issued orders for reference
to the Frankfurt/Main Higher Regional Court in accordance with the German Capital Investor Model Proceedings Act
(Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahrensgesetz – KapMuG) and has temporarily suspended the initial proceedings."
"On May 16, 2012,
the Frankfurt/Main Higher Regional Court had ruled that there were no material errors in Deutsche Telekom AG’s prospectus."
"In its decision on October 21, 2014, the Federal Court of Justice partly revoked this ruling, determined that there was a
mistake in the prospectus, and referred the case back to the Frankfurt/Main Higher Regional Court."
"Following an appeal from both parties, in February 2021, the Federal Court of Justice once again
referred
the
proceedings
back
to
the
Frankfurt/Main
Higher
Regional
Court
for
further
consideration."
"In
November 2021, Deutsche Telekom AG presented a settlement concept under which a concrete settlement offer is to be made
to every eligible plaintiff."
"The settlement offers are made without any judicial decision and do not constitute an admission
of liability on the part of Deutsche Telekom AG."
Settlements have now been agreed with almost all of the eligible plaintiffs.
"Appropriate provisions for risk have been recognized in the statement of financial position for the remaining still pending
actions."
"Given the very low residual risk, this matter will no longer be reported on in the future."
Claims relating to charges for the shared use of cable ducts.
"In 2012, Kabel Deutschland Vertrieb und Service GmbH (today
Vodafone Deutschland GmbH (VDG)) filed a claim against Telekom Deutschland GmbH to reduce the annual charge for the
rights to use cable duct capacities."
"In similar proceedings, the then Unitymedia Hessen GmbH & Co."
"KG, Unitymedia
NRW GmbH, and Kabel BW GmbH (today all Vodafone West) filed claims against Telekom Deutschland GmbH in
January 2013, demanding that it cease charging the plaintiffs more than a specific and precisely stated amount for the shared
use of cable ducts, including in the future."
"The claims were rejected by the Frankfurt/Main Higher Regional Court (VDG) and
by the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court (Vodafone West) and an appeal was not allowed in both cases."
"The claims were rejected with legally binding effect for the time periods
prior to this."
"In a ruling on December 14, 2021, the Federal Court of Justice referred the proceedings concerning the remaining
claims back to the responsible Higher Regional Courts for a new hearing and decision."
"VDG has since updated its claim, which
it now puts at around EUR 826 million plus interest for the period from January 2012 to December 2022."
"The plaintiff Vodafone
West has also updated its claim, which it now puts at around EUR 418 million plus interest for the period from January 2016 to
June 2022."
It is currently not possible to estimate the financial impact of both these proceedings with sufficient certainty.
Sprint Merger class action.
"On October 29, 2021, the complaint was amended."
"The amended complaint
is directed at the same defendants and the same underlying transactions as in the original action; however, it includes
additional submission on alleged facts."
"It is currently not possible to estimate the resulting claim and financial risk of these
proceedings with sufficient certainty."
"Proceedings
against
T‑Mobile US
in

of
the
cyberattack
on
T‑Mobile US
in
August
2021."
"In
August 2021, T‑Mobile US confirmed that their systems had been subject to a criminal cyberattack that compromised data
of millions of their customers, former customers, and prospective customers."
"With the assistance of outside cybersecurity
experts, T‑Mobile US located and closed the unauthorized access to their systems and identified customers whose information
was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements."
"As a result of the cyberattack, numerous
consumer class actions including mass arbitrations were filed against T‑Mobile US."
"The class actions brought before the federal
courts were consolidated into one action in December 2021."
"The plaintiffs are claiming damages in an as yet unspecified
amount."
"On July 22, 2022, T‑Mobile US entered into an agreement to settle the consumer class action in the Federal Court for
USD 350 million."
"In addition, T‑Mobile US committed to spending a total of USD 150 million in 2022 and 2023 on data security
and related technologies."
The settlement was approved by the court in June 2023.
"A member of the class action appealed
against the final decision on approval and is objecting to the awarding of lawyers’ fees by the court to the lawyer for the class
action."
This is further delaying the closure of the proceedings.
"159
asserted to date by current, former, and potential customers affected by the cyberattack in 2021."
"T‑Mobile US has recognized
corresponding provisions for risks in the statement of financial position of around USD 0.3 billion (EUR 0.3 billion)."
"Furthermore, in November 2021, a derivative action was brought against the members of the Board of Directors of T‑Mobile US
and against T‑Mobile US as nominal defendant."
This action has since been withdrawn.
"In September 2022, a further purported
shareholder filed a new derivative action against the members of the Board of Directors of T‑Mobile US and against T‑Mobile US
as nominal defendant alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duties relating to the company’s cybersecurity practices."
"It is
currently not possible to estimate the resultant financial risk with sufficient certainty."
"In addition, inquiries have been made by various government agencies, law enforcement and other state authorities, with which
T‑Mobile US is cooperating in full."
"It is currently not possible to estimate the resultant financial risk of these proceedings with
sufficient certainty.."
Proceedings against T‑Mobile US in consequence of the cyberattack on T‑Mobile US in January 2023.
"On January 5, 2023,
T‑Mobile US identified that a bad actor was obtaining data through an application programming interface (API)."
"The results of the investigation indicate that, in total, around 37 million
current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts were affected, although many of these accounts did not include the full
data set."
"T‑Mobile US assumes that the attacker retrieved data via the affected API for the first time from or around
November 25, 2022."
"In accordance with federal and state requirements, the company has notified those individuals whose data
was affected."
"In connection with this cyberattack, consumer class actions were filed against T‑Mobile US and official inquiries
were submitted to the company, to which it will respond and, as a result of which, it may incur substantial expenses."
"It is
currently not possible to estimate the resultant financial risk with sufficient certainty."
"Like many other large telecommunications and internet providers, Deutsche Telekom is exposed to
a growing number of intellectual property rights disputes."
"There is a risk that we may have to pay license fees and/or
compensation; we are also exposed to a risk of cease-and-desist orders, for example relating to the sale of a product or the use
of a technology."
"Further, Deutsche Telekom intends to defend itself and/or pursue its claims vigorously in each of these proceedings."
"Major ongoing anti-trust proceedings
Like all companies, our Group is subject to anti-trust law."
"In recent years, we have notably stepped up our compliance efforts in
this area too."
"Nevertheless, Deutsche Telekom and its subsidiaries are from time to time subject to proceedings under anti-trust
law or follow-on damage actions under civil law."
"In the following, we describe material anti-trust proceedings and resulting
claims for damages."
"If, in extremely rare cases, required disclosures on individual anti-trust proceedings are not made, we
concluded that these disclosures may seriously undermine the outcome of the relevant proceedings."
Claims for damages against Slovak Telekom following a European Commission decision to impose fines.
"The European
Commission decided on October 15, 2014 that Slovak Telekom had abused its market power on the Slovak broadband market
and as a result imposed fines on Slovak Telekom and Deutsche Telekom AG, which were paid in full in January 2015."
"After
the General Court of the European Union partially overturned the European Commission’s decision in 2018 and reduced the
fines by a total of EUR 13 million, the legal recourse following the ruling of the European Court of Justice on March 25, 2021 is
exhausted."
"Following the decision of the European Commission, competitors filed damage actions against Slovak Telekom with
the civil court in Bratislava."
"These claims seek compensation for alleged damages due to Slovak Telekom’s abuse of a dominant
market position, as determined by the European Commission."
"Three claims totaling EUR 219 million plus interest are currently
pending."
It is currently not possible to estimate the financial impact with sufficient certainty.

Claims for damages against Deutsche Telekom AG, including due to insolvency of Phones4U."
"Phones4U was an independent
British mobile retailer, which declared insolvency in 2014."
"The insolvency administrator is pursuing claims before the High Court
of Justice in London against the mobile providers active on the UK market at that time and their parent companies on the
grounds of alleged collusion in violation of anti-trust law and breach of contract."
"Deutsche Telekom AG, which at that time
held 50 % of the mobile company EE Limited, has rejected the claims as unsubstantiated."
"The High Court of Justice in London
heard testimony from several witnesses and experts in the period between mid-May and the end of July 2022 with a view to
establishing the legal basis for a claim."
"On November 10, 2023, the High Court of Justice in London rejected all claims made by
Phones4U against all defendants."
"In December 2023, Phones4U filed an application for leave to lodge an appeal with the High
Court of Justice in London."
"The hearing took place on December 19, 2023."
"The High Court of Justice in London rejected the

"Compliance risks
Compliance risks are risks arising from systematic infringements of legal or ethical standards that could result in regulatory
or criminal liability on the part of the company, its executive body members, or employees, or result in a significant loss of
reputation."
"In order to minimize these risks, we have set up a compliance management system."
We want to contain these risks.
"Risks with an impact on cash flows
are monitored in a standard process and hedged accordingly using derivative and non-derivative hedges."
"Derivative financial
instruments are used solely for hedging and never for speculative purposes."
"The following risk areas – liquidity, credit, currency,
and interest rate risks – are evaluated taking into account all hedges."
"For further information on the risk assessment, please refer to the “Corporate risks” table above."
"To ensure the Group’s and Deutsche Telekom AG’s solvency and financial flexibility at all times, we maintain
a liquidity reserve in the form of credit lines and cash as part of our liquidity management."
"Since the successful business
combination of T‑Mobile US and Sprint, T‑Mobile US has pursued its own separate financing and liquidity strategy."
"Deutsche Telekom (excluding T‑Mobile US): Primarily bilateral credit agreements with 20 banks with an aggregate total volume
of EUR 12.0 billion were available as of December 31, 2023, which were not utilized."

Deutsche Telekom."
"In our operating business and certain banking activities, we are exposed to a credit risk, i.e., the risk that a
counterparty will not fulfill its contractual obligations."
"To keep this credit risk to a minimum, we conclude transactions with
regard to financing activities only with counterparties that have at least a credit rating of BBB+/Baa1; we also actively manage
limits."
"In addition, we have concluded collateral agreements for our derivative transactions."
"At the level of operations, the
outstanding debts are continuously monitored in each area, i.e., locally."
"Currency risks result from dividend payments received, investments, financing measures, and operations."
"Risks from foreign currency fluctuations are hedged on a pro rata basis depending on their probability of occurrence, if
they affect the Group’s cash flows (transaction risks)."
"However, foreign-currency risks that do not influence the Group’s cash
flows, for example, risks resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign operations into euros (translation
risks) are generally not hedged."
"Deutsche Telekom may nevertheless also hedge these foreign-currency risks under certain
circumstances."
"Our interest rate risks mainly result from Group financing: On the one hand, we have an interest rate risk
relating to the issue of new liabilities, and on the other, we have an interest rate risk arising from variable-interest liabilities."
The euro interest rate position is actively managed as part of our interest rate management activities.
"Each year, a maximum
is set for the percentage of variable-interest liabilities, taking into account the planned finance costs."
"Inflationary pressure
in Germany, Europe, and the United States resulted in further interest rate hikes by central banks in 2023."
"Given the heavily
inverted yield curve, the variable-interest debt portfolio and hence interest sensitivity further declined substantially."
"The
USD debt position of T‑Mobile US primarily comprises partially cancelable, fixed-income bonds."
"For further information, please refer to Note 43 “Financial instruments and risk management” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Tax risks
We are subject to the applicable tax laws in many different countries."
"Risks can arise from changes in local taxation laws or case
law and different interpretations of existing provisions."
"These risks can impact both our tax expense and benefit as well as tax
receivables and liabilities."
"Other financial risks and opportunities
This section contains information on other financial risks that we consider to be immaterial at present or cannot evaluate based
on current knowledge."
"Deutsche Telekom’s credit rating affects our access to the capital markets, to the international finance markets,
and our refinancing costs."
"A lower rating could impede access to the capital market and, over time, would lead to an increase
in the cost of debt financing."
"We intend to maintain our rating in a corridor from A- to BBB and thereby safeguard undisputed
access to the capital market."
"As of December 31, 2023, Deutsche Telekom AG’s credit rating with Moody’s was Baa1 with a
stable outlook, while Standard & Poor’s and Fitch rated us BBB+ with a stable outlook."

Sales of shares by the Federal Republic or KfW Bankengruppe.
"As of December 31, 2023, the Federal Republic and
KfW Bankengruppe jointly held 30.46 % in Deutsche Telekom AG."
"It is possible that the Federal Republic will continue its
policy of privatization and sell further equity interests in a manner designed not to disrupt the capital markets and with the
involvement of KfW Bankengruppe."
"There is a risk that the sale of a significant volume of shares by the Federal Republic or
KfW Bankengruppe, or any speculation to this effect, could have a negative impact on the price of the T-Share."
Impact of the CR strategy on the value of the Company.
"Growing numbers of investors take
sustainability aspects into account in their investment decisions (Socially Responsible Investments, SRI)."
"SRI investment
products consist of securities from companies that have been reviewed based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
criteria."
"The development of demand from socially responsible investors for the T‑Share is an indicator we can use to assess our
sustainability performance."
"The Socially Responsible Investment ESG KPI indicates the percentage of Deutsche Telekom AG
shares held by such investors."
"Our commitment to greater sustainability is paying off: as of December 31, 2023, around 32 %
of all T-Shares were held by investors who show concern for environmental, social, and governance criteria in their investment
choices."
"We have refined the methodology and underlying data and have switched to monitoring the sustainably managed
shares at fund level and no longer at an institutional level."
"For better comparability with other companies, the total number of
shares given pertains to the number of Deutsche Telekom shares in free float."
Impairment of Deutsche Telekom AG’s assets.
"The value of the assets of Deutsche Telekom AG and its subsidiaries is reviewed
periodically."
"These tests may lead to the recognition of impairment losses that do not,
however, result in cash outflows."
"This could impact to a considerable extent on our results, which in turn may negatively affect
the T-Share price."
"For further information, please refer to the section “Summary of accounting policies – Judgments and estimates” in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements."
"In 2023, the price level on the world energy market declined compared with 2022."

"The
ICS organization bundles and integrates the internal control processes and supports the Board of Management in designing,
implementing, and maintaining an appropriate and effective control system."
"It comprises ICS Management at Group
Headquarters and the local ICS management of each entity."
"Central ICS Management is responsible for managing and
coordinating the ICS processes in their entirety."
"The entities to be included in the ICS are also reviewed and identified annually on the basis of Deutsche Telekom’s statement of
investment holdings."
All material entities are fully integrated in the ICS process.
"Consistent Group-wide minimum requirements
for the entities’ control systems are defined based on the key Group functions."
"These include, for example, accounting,
IT, procurement, HR, security, data privacy, taxes, compliance, and also corporate responsibility."
"The
corresponding controls are documented in a Group-wide IT system and are reviewed for their appropriateness and
effectiveness at least once a year."
"Effectiveness is regularly reviewed applying the dual-checking principle and, depending on the risk exposure of the controls
within the functional unit, across departments or (additionally) by Internal Audit."
"The aim is to identify control gaps and
non-effective controls, in particular to analyze the impact on financial reporting and to initiate and monitor suitable
countermeasures."
"The ICS process is completed with a cascaded approval process, starting with the function owners in the entities and the local
finance and managing directors, through to Group level."
"The ICS Steering Committee, with the involvement of the Group’s most
important function owners, then evaluates the results and makes recommendations to the Board of Management."
"Based on
this, the Board of Management decides on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ICS twice a year."
"The Audit Committee
is informed in detail on the status and results of the ICS process at least three times a year and discusses the alignment of the
ICS with management and the external auditors."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations in every ICS."
"No control system
– even if it is deemed to be appropriate and effective – can ensure that all relevant control risks are identified and are being
completely and effectively addressed by means of controls."
"All non-material entities exposed to risks with an extent that is deemed to be low from a Group perspective, are included in
the Group-wide ICS as part of a simplified and standardized process."
"These entities must submit an annual self-declaration,
based on a control risk catalog, on the maturity of the implemented controls and a statement on the effectiveness of the ICS
in their entity."
Internal Audit regularly reviews these self-declarations in a risk-oriented way.
"The ICS Steering Committee, the
Board of Management, and the Audit Committee are informed at least once a year about the results of the self-assessments."
"A risk
and opportunity management system is necessary from both a business point of view and on the basis of laws and regulations,
in particular § 91 (2) and (3) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG)."
"Our risk and opportunity management
system is organized on a decentralized basis."
"The Group Risk Governance unit defines the Group-wide methods, including the
associated reporting system, and the segments are integrated via their own risk and opportunity management."
"The relevant
owners in each of the segments are responsible for identifying, assessing, and continuously monitoring risks."
"This is also at
the core of our risk culture, which includes the motto “Everyone is a risk manager.” In other words, every individual takes
responsibility for their risks."
"For further information on the risk and opportunity management system, please refer to the section “Risk and opportunity management system.”
Compliance management system
Our compliance culture is a key component for corporate governance based on integrity and respect."
"We have expressed
our Group-wide commitment to complying with ethical principles and both legal and statutory requirements."
"We have
incorporated this pledge in our Guiding Principles and our Code of Conduct."
"In particular, when we established the compliance
management system to prevent corruption, we used the Principles for the Proper Performance of Reasonable Assurance
Engagements Relating to Compliance Management Systems laid down in IDW Assurance Standard 980 as a basis."
"The Board
of Management considers its overall responsibility for compliance as a key leadership task."
"Our Chief Compliance Officer
is responsible for the design and management of the compliance management system."
"Compliance officers implement the
compliance management system and our compliance goals locally at the level of our operating segments and national
companies."
"For further information on the compliance management system, please refer to “Aspect 5: Fighting corruption” in the section “Combined non-financial
statement.”

"An external audit of risk and opportunity management in accordance with IDW Auditing Standard 981 carried out
at the end of 2022/start of 2023 for selected parts of the organization and risk categories did not uncover any findings that
would cast doubt on its appropriateness or effectiveness."
"Accounting-related internal control system
The accounting-related ICS comprises the principles, methods, and measures used to ensure appropriate accounting."
"Another objective of the accounting-related ICS is the
preparation of the annual financial statements of Deutsche Telekom AG and the combined management report in accordance
with German GAAP."
"It is generally true of any ICS that regardless of how it is specifically structured there can be no absolute guarantee that it
will achieve its objectives."
"Therefore, as regards the accounting-related ICS, there can only ever be relative, but no absolute,
certainty that material accounting misstatements can be prevented or detected."
Group Accounting manages the processes of Group accounting and management reporting.
"Legal provisions, accounting
standards, and other pronouncements are continuously analyzed as to whether and to what extent they are relevant and
how they impact on financial reporting."
"The relevant requirements are defined in the Group Accounting Manual, for example,
communicated to the relevant units and, together with the financial reporting calendar that is binding throughout the Group,
form the basis of the financial reporting process."
"In addition, supplementary process directives such as the Intercompany
Policy, standardized reporting formats, IT systems, as well as IT-based reporting and consolidation processes, support the
process of uniform and compliant Group accounting."
"Where necessary, we also draw on the services of external experts, for
example, to measure pension obligations or in connection with purchase price allocations."
"Group Accounting ensures that these
requirements are complied with consistently throughout the Group."
"The staff involved in the accounting process receive regular
training."
"Deutsche Telekom AG and the Group companies are responsible for ensuring that Group-wide policies, regulations,
and procedures are complied with."
"The Group companies ensure the compliance and timeliness of their accounting-related
processes and systems and, in doing so, are supported and monitored by Group Accounting."
"Operational accounting processes at the national and international level are increasingly managed by our shared service
centers."
"Harmonizing the processes enhances their efficiency and quality and, in turn, improves the reliability of the internal
ICS."
"The ICS thus safeguards both the quality of internal processes at the shared service centers and the interfaces to the Group
companies by means of adequate controls and an internal certification process."
Internal controls are embedded in the accounting process depending on risk levels.
"The accounting-related ICS comprises both
preventive and detective controls, which include
Central and local ICS management continuously develop the ICS further in line with the operational processes, systematically
responding to new technologies and ways of working."
"These include the use of software robots, real-time alarms, artificial
intelligence, and agile working."
"We have implemented a standardized process throughout the Group for monitoring the effectiveness of the accounting-related
ICS."
This process systematically focuses on risks of possible misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.
"At the
beginning of the year, specific accounts and accounting-related process steps are selected based on risk factors."
"They are
then reviewed for effectiveness in the course of the year."
"If control weaknesses are found, they are analyzed and assessed,
particularly in terms of their impact on the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report."
"Material
control weaknesses, the action plans for eradicating them, and ongoing progress are reported to the Board of Management
and additionally to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"In order to ensure a high-quality
accounting-related ICS, Internal Audit is closely involved in all stages of the process."

Legal structure of the Group
Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn, is the parent of the Deutsche Telekom Group."
"Its shares are traded on the Frankfurt/Main Stock
Exchange as well as on other stock exchanges."
"Shareholders’ equity
Each share entitles the holder to one vote."
"These voting rights are restricted, however, in relation to treasury shares
(at December 31, 2023: around 8 million in total)."
"The amount of issued capital assigned to treasury shares was approximately EUR 20 million
at December 31, 2023."
This equates to 0.2 % of share capital.
"7,843,113 treasury shares were held at December 31, 2023."
For information on the treasury shares in accordance with § 160 (1) No.
"2 AktG, please refer to Note 8 in the annual financial statements of
Deutsche Telekom AG as of December 31, 2023 and to Note 19 “Shareholders’ equity” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Moreover, the requirements under § 71 (2)
sentences 2 and 3 AktG must be complied with."
Shares shall not be purchased for the purpose of trading in treasury shares.
This authorization may be exercised in full or in part.
"The purchase can be carried out in partial tranches spread over various
purchase dates within the authorization period until the maximum purchase volume is reached."
"Dependent Group companies of
Deutsche Telekom AG within the meaning of § 17 AktG or third parties acting for the account of Deutsche Telekom AG or for the
account of dependent Group companies of Deutsche Telekom AG within the meaning of § 17 AktG are also entitled to purchase
the shares."
The shares are purchased through the stock exchange in adherence to the principle of equal treatment (§ 53a AktG).

The shares may be used for one or several of the purposes permitted by the authorization granted by the shareholders’ meeting
on April 1, 2021 under item 7 on the agenda."
"The shares may also be used for purposes involving an exclusion of subscription
rights."
"In addition, they may be sold on the stock market or by way of an offer to all shareholders, or canceled."
"Under the resolution of the shareholders’ meeting on April 1, 2021, the Board of Management is also authorized to acquire the
shares through the use of equity derivatives."
No treasury shares were acquired in the reporting period and in the prior year.
"Currently, the treasury shares for participants of
the Share Matching Plan and of the Shares2You share program for employees are issued from the pool of shares previously held
in a trust deposit."
"As part of the acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Corp., Bellevue, and Powertel, Inc., Bellevue, in 2001, Deutsche Telekom AG
issued new shares from authorized capital to a trustee, for the benefit of holders of warrants, options, and conversion rights,
among others."
These options or conversion rights expired in full in the 2013 financial year.
"As a result, the trustee no longer
had any obligation to fulfill any claims in accordance with the purpose of the deposit."
"The trust relationship was terminated
at the start of 2016 and the deposited shares were transferred free of charge to a custody account of Deutsche Telekom AG."
The previously deposited shares are accounted for in the same way as treasury shares in accordance with § 272 (1a) HGB.
"On
the basis of authorization by the shareholders’ meeting on April 1, 2021, the treasury shares acquired free of charge may be
used for the same purposes as the treasury shares acquired for a consideration."
"In the reporting year, 5,927 thousand previously
deposited shares were reallocated for issue to eligible participants of the Share Matching Plan (prior year: 708 thousand
shares)."
"For matching shares from the Share Matching Plan and for free shares from the employee share program Shares2You, treasury
shares are transferred free of charge to the custody accounts of employees of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"In cases where treasury
shares are transferred to the custody accounts of employees of other Group companies, the costs have been transferred at
fair value to the respective Group company since the 2016 financial year."
"For treasury shares bought by way of the personal
investment as part of the Shares2You program and transferred to the custody accounts of employees, a conversion rate of
EUR 20.96 per share or EUR 20.24 per share was used."
"The conversion is determined using the lowest price at which a trade
actually took place on an official German exchange on the date of conversion."
"In all months of the reporting year, except for December, treasury shares (5,914 thousand in total) were reallocated and
transferred to the custody accounts of eligible participants (prior year: 760 thousand treasury shares)."
"As of
December 31, 2023, disposals of treasury shares resulting from the transfers in the reporting period accounted for 0.12 %, or
EUR 15 million, of share capital."
Gains on disposal arising from transfers of treasury shares amounted to EUR 118 million.
"The
transfers of treasury shares increased the capital reserve by EUR 103 million."
"In the reporting year, 1,808 thousand treasury
shares with a fair value of EUR 37 million were billed to other Group companies."
"The authorization may
be exercised in full or on one or more occasions in partial amounts."
"The Board of Management is authorized, subject to
the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude residual amounts from shareholders’ subscription rights."
"If the issue or sale is carried out in analogous or mutatis mutandis application of § 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG, this
shall also constitute the disapplication of subscription rights."
"The Board of Management is also authorized, subject to the
approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the rights accruing to the shares in the future and the conditions for issuing
shares (2022 Authorized Capital)."

"Intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives, including 5G, LTE, UMTS, and GSM licenses, are measured at cost and generally
amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives."
"Such assets are impaired if their recoverable amount, which is
measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, is lower than the carrying amount."
"Indefinite-lived
intangible assets (mobile communications licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States
(FCC licenses)) are carried at cost."
"While FCC licenses are issued for a fixed time, renewals of FCC licenses have occurred
routinely and at negligible costs."
"Moreover, Deutsche Telekom has determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory,
contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that limit the useful lives of the FCC licenses, and therefore treats the FCC
licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset."
"They are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually or whenever there
are indications of impairment and, if necessary, written down to the recoverable amount."
"If the reasons for recognizing the
original impairment loss no longer apply, impairment losses are reversed taking amortization into account, i.e., not exceeding
the value that would have been applied if no impairment losses had been recognized in prior periods."
Intangible assets may also be acquired in connection with a frequency or spectrum exchange.
"The costs of intangible assets
acquired in such a barter transaction are measured at fair value if the swap has commercial substance and the fair value of the
asset received and the asset given up is reliably measurable."
"If the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair
value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable, the carrying amount of the asset given up is
used as the acquisition costs of the asset received."
"Limited-term spectrum leases normally satisfy the recognition criteria because the lessors fulfill their performance obligations
on entering into the contract, which means there are no more executory contracts."
"Acquired television, film, and sports rights
(media broadcasting rights) are also recognized on a regular basis."
"On initial recognition, the intangible asset and the corresponding financial liability are measured only on the basis of the
minimum contract term."
"Where a right of termination exists, only the period up to the earliest possible termination is
considered on initial recognition."
"Where a right of renewal exists, the renewal period is not considered on initial recognition."

The useful lives and the amortization methods of the intangible assets are reviewed at least at each financial year-end."
"In
accordance with IAS 8, any changes are recognized prospectively as changes in accounting estimates."
Amortization of mobile communications licenses begins as soon as the related network is ready for use.
"The useful lives
of mobile communications licenses are determined based on several factors, including the term of the licenses granted by
the respective regulatory body in each country, the availability and expected cost of renewing the licenses, as well as the
development of future technologies."
"Research expenditures are expensed
as incurred."
"Development is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production
of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems, or services prior to the commencement
of commercial production or use."
"Examples of activities typically included in development are the design, construction, and
testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models involving new technology."
"The development phase is deemed
complete when the responsible functional unit has formally documented that the capitalized asset is ready for its intended use."
"Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment based on the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which
the goodwill is allocated (impairment-only approach)."
"The impairment test is carried out on a regular basis at the end of each
financial year, as well as whenever there are indications that a carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is impaired."
"An
impairment loss recognized for goodwill may not be reversed or reduced in subsequent reporting periods."
"Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less straight-line depreciation, and impairment losses, if applicable."
"The
depreciation period is based on the expected useful life of the assets."
"Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated
pro rata temporis in the year of acquisition."
"The residual values, useful lives, and the depreciation methods of the assets are
reviewed at least at each financial year-end."
"In accordance with IAS 8, any changes are recognized prospectively as changes
in accounting estimates."
"In addition to directly attributable material and labor costs, the costs of internally developed assets
also include overhead costs relating to production or the provision of services."
"If an item of property, plant and equipment consists of several components with different estimated
useful lives, those components that are significant are depreciated over their individual useful lives."
"Maintenance and repair
costs are expensed as incurred."
"Public investment grants reduce the cost of the property, plant and equipment for which the grants were made."
"Investment
grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with the conditions attached to them, and
the grants will be received in the full amount."
"If this reasonable assurance already exists when the contract is being concluded,
the grant is recognized in full under other financial assets upon conclusion of the agreement, with a matching non-financial
other liability for the build-out obligation."
"In subsequent periods, the financial asset measured at amortized cost is reduced
upon receipt of the payments."
"The other liability is derecognized on a pro rata basis as the build-out progresses, reducing
the carrying amount of the publicly funded property, plant and equipment."
"If there is not yet reasonable assurance, only the
installment payments received are recognized, with a matching non-financial other liability."
"As soon as there is reasonable
assurance, outstanding grants are recognized under other financial assets, and the carrying amounts of the other liability and
the publicly funded property, plant and equipment are adjusted in accordance with the actual build-out progress."
"All grants
received are recognized in net cash used in/from investing activities."

On disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal, the carrying amount of the item is derecognized."
"The gain or loss arising from the disposal of an item of property,
plant and equipment is the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item and is
recognized as other operating income or other operating expenses when the item is derecognized."
"The actual useful lives may lie within these ranges due to
contractual arrangements or other specific factors such as time and location."
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or terms of the lease.
"Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized
as part of the cost of that asset."
"Deutsche Telekom defines qualifying assets as construction projects or other assets for which
a period of at least twelve months is necessary in order to get them ready for their intended use or sale."
"Impairments of intangible assets, items of property, plant and equipment, and right-of-use assets
Impairments are identified by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount."
"If individual assets do not generate
future cash flows independently of other assets, recoverability is assessed on the basis of the larger cash-generating unit to
which the assets belong."
"At each reporting date, Deutsche Telekom assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may
be impaired."
"If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit must be determined."
"In
addition, annual impairment tests are carried out for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill and FCC licenses)
at regular intervals."
"For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each
of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination."
"If the carrying amount of the
cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill allocated to this cash-generating
unit must be reduced in the amount of the difference."
Impairment losses for goodwill must not be reversed.
"If the impairment
loss recognized for the cash-generating unit exceeds the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill, the additional amount of
the impairment loss is to be distributed on a pro rata basis to the assets allocated to the cash-generating unit."
"The fair values or
values in use (if measurable) of the individual assets are to be considered to be the minimum values."
"If the reasons for previously
recognized impairments no longer exist, the impairment losses on the assets concerned (with the exception of goodwill) must
be reversed."
"The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value
in use."
"The recoverable amount is generally determined by means of a discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation, unless it can
be determined on the basis of a market price."
"These DCF calculations use projections that are based on financial budgets
approved by management covering a ten-year period and are also used for internal purposes."
"The planning horizon reflects
the assumptions for short- to mid-term market developments."
"Cash flows beyond the ten-year period are extrapolated using
appropriate growth rates."
"For the key assumptions on which management has based its calculation of the recoverable amount,
please refer to the explanations provided under “Judgments and estimates,” further on in this section."
"Inventories
Inventories are carried at cost at initial recognition and are subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realizable
value."
"Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their
present location and condition."
Cost is measured using the weighted average cost method.
"Net realizable value is the estimated
standalone selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the necessary estimated
selling expenses."

Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are classified as such if it is highly probable that their carrying amount will
be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use."
"These assets are measured at the lower
of the carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and recognized as non-current assets and disposal groups held for
sale."
Such assets are no longer depreciated.
"Impairment of such assets is recognized if fair value less costs of disposal is lower
than the carrying amount."
"If fair value less costs of disposal subsequently increases, the impairment loss previously recognized
must be reversed."
"The reversal of impairment losses is limited to the impairment losses previously recognized for the assets
concerned."
"If the requirements for the classification of assets as held for sale are no longer met, the assets may no longer be
shown as held for sale."
"The assets are to be measured at the lower of the carrying amount that would have applied if the asset
had not been classified as held for sale, and the recoverable amount at the date at which the requirements for the classification
as held for sale are no longer met."
"Employee benefits
Deutsche Telekom maintains defined benefit pension plans in various countries on the basis of the pensionable compensation
of its employees and their length of service."
"Some of these pension plans are financed through external pension funds and
some through incorporation in a contractual trust agreement (CTA)."
"Provisions for pensions are actuarially measured using the
projected unit credit method for defined benefit pension plans, taking into account not only the pension obligations and vested
pension rights known at the reporting date, but also expected future salary and benefit increases."
"The interest rate used to
determine the present value of the obligations is generally set on the basis of the yields on high-quality corporate bonds in
the respective currency area."
"The return on plan assets and interest expenses resulting from the unwinding of the discount
are reported in profit/loss from financial activities."
Service cost is classified as operating expenses.
"Past service cost resulting
from a change in the pension plan are immediately recognized in the income statement in the period in which the change took
effect."
"Gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized immediately and in full
in the period in which they occur outside profit or loss within equity."
"Some Group entities grant defined contribution plans to
their employees in accordance with statutory or contractual requirements, with the payments being made to state or private
pension insurance funds."
"Under defined contribution plans, the employer does not assume any other obligations above and
beyond the payment of contributions to an external fund."
"The amount of the future pension payments will exclusively depend
on the contribution made by the employer (and their employees, if applicable) to the external fund, including income from the
investment of such contributions."
"The amounts payable are expensed when the obligation to pay the amounts is established,
and classified as expenses."
"Up until December 31, 2012, Deutsche Telekom maintained a joint pension fund, Bundes-Pensions-Service für Post und
Telekommunikation e.V."
"(Federal Pension Service for Post and Telecommunications – BPS-PT), Bonn, together with Deutsche
Post AG and Deutsche Postbank AG for civil-servant pension plans."
"BPS-PT made pension and allowance payments to retired
employees and their surviving dependents who are entitled to pension payments as a result of civil-servant status."
"The level of Deutsche Telekom AG’s payment obligations to
the Civil Service Pension Fund is defined under § 16 of the German Act on the Legal Provisions for the Former Deutsche
Bundespost Staff (Postpersonalrechtsgesetz)."
"Deutsche Telekom
is not required to fulfill any other obligations in respect of pensions for civil servants."
"The payment obligations are therefore
defined contribution plans."
"In the past, Deutsche Telekom AG and its domestic subsidiaries agreed on phased retirement arrangements with varying terms
and conditions, predominantly based on what is known as the block model."
"Two types of obligations, both measured at their
present value in accordance with actuarial principles, arise and are accounted for separately."
"The first type of obligation relates
to the cumulative outstanding settlement amount, which is recorded on a pro rata basis during the active or working phase."
"The second type of obligation relates
to the employer’s obligation to make top-up payments plus an additional contribution to the statutory pension scheme."
"Top-up
payments are often hybrid in nature, i.e., although the agreement is often considered a form of compensation for terminating
the employment relationship at an earlier date, payments to be made at a later date are subject to the performance of work in
the future."
"Despite having the characteristics of severance payments, the top-up payments must be recognized ratably over the
vesting period due to their dependency on the performance of work in the future."
"If the block model is used, the vesting period
for top-up payments starts when the employee is granted the entitlement to participate in the phased retirement program and
ends upon entry into the passive phase (leave from work)."

"185
Obligations arising from the granting of termination benefits are recognized when Deutsche Telekom does not have a realistic
possibility of withdrawal from the granting of the corresponding benefits."
"Severance payments for employees and obligations
arising in connection with early retirement arrangements in Germany are mainly granted in the form of offers to the employees
to leave the Company voluntarily."
"As a rule, such obligations are not recognized before the employees have accepted an
offer from the Company, unless the Company is prevented by legal or other restrictions from withdrawing its offer at an
earlier date."
"Obligations arising from the sole decision by the Company to shed jobs are recognized when the Company has
announced a detailed formal plan to terminate employment relationships."
"If termination benefits are granted in connection
with restructuring measures within the meaning of IAS 37, a liability under IAS 19 is recognized at the same time as a
restructuring provision."
"Where termination benefits fall due more than twelve months after the reporting date, the expected
amount to be paid is discounted to the reporting date."
"If the timing or the amount of the payment is still uncertain at the
reporting date, the obligations are reported under other provisions."
"Other provisions
Other provisions are recognized for current legal or constructive obligations to third parties that are uncertain with regard to
their timing or their amount."
"Provisions are recognized for these obligations provided they relate to past transactions or events,
will more likely than not require an outflow of resources to settle, and this outflow can be reliably measured."
"Provisions are
carried at their expected settlement amount, taking into account all identifiable risks and uncertainties."
"The settlement amount
is calculated on the basis of a best estimate; suitable estimation methods and sources of information are used depending
on the characteristics of the obligation."
"In the case of a number of similar obligations, the group of obligations is treated as
one single obligation."
The expected value method is used as the estimation method.
"If there is a range of potential events
with the same probability of occurrence, the average value is taken."
"Individual obligations (e.g., legal and litigation risks) are
regularly evaluated based on the most probable outcome, provided an exceptional probability distribution does not mean that
other estimates would lead to a more appropriate evaluation."
"The measurement of provisions is based on past experience,
relevant costing, and price information, as well as estimates and reports from experts."
"If experience or relevant costing or
price information is used to determine the settlement amount, these values are extrapolated to the expected settlement date."
"Suitable price trend indicators (e.g., construction price indexes or inflation rates) are used for this purpose."
"Provisions are
discounted when the effect of the time value of money is material."
"Provisions are discounted using pre-tax market interest
rates that reflect the term of the obligation and the risk associated with it (insofar as not already taken into consideration in the
calculation of the settlement amount)."
"Reimbursement claims are not netted against provisions; they are recognized separately
as soon as their realization is virtually certain."
"Provisions for decommissioning, restoration, and similar obligations arising from the acquisition of property, plant and
equipment are offset by a corresponding increase in the capitalized cost of the relevant asset."
"Changes at a later date in
estimates of the amount or timing of payments or changes to the interest rate applied in measuring such obligations also result
in retrospective increases or decreases in the carrying amount of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment."
"These
in turn change the depreciation of the asset to be recognized in the future, which leads to the changes in estimates being
recognized in profit or loss over the remaining useful life."
"Where the decrease in the amount of a provision exceeds the carrying
amount of the related asset, the excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss."
"Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognized as soon as Deutsche Telekom becomes a party to the contractual regulations of the
financial instrument."
"However, in the case of regular way purchase or sale, the settlement date is relevant for the initial
recognition and derecognition."
This is the day on which the asset is delivered to or by Deutsche Telekom.
"In general, financial
assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only
when, the entity currently has a right to offset the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis."
"If, in cases where risk is shared, the acquirer is unable to sell the assets to a third party, the assets will continue
to be recognized to the extent of the maximum risk retained."
"Financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation specified
in the contract expires or if there is a substantial modification of the terms of the contract."

Disclosures on fair value."
"When determining the fair value, it is important to maximize the use of current inputs observable
in liquid markets for the financial instrument in question and minimize the use of other inputs (e.g., historical prices, prices
for similar instruments, prices on illiquid markets)."
A three-level measurement hierarchy is defined for these purposes.
"If
prices quoted in liquid markets are available at the reporting date for the respective financial instrument, these will be used
unadjusted for the measurement (Level 1 measurement)."
Other input parameters are then irrelevant for the measurement.
"One
such example is shares and bonds that are actively traded on a stock exchange."
"If quoted prices on liquid markets are not
available at the reporting date for the respective financial instrument, but the instrument can be measured using other inputs
that are observable on the market at the reporting date, a Level 2 measurement will be applied."
"The conditions for this are
that no major adjustments have been made to the observable inputs and no unobservable inputs are used."
"Examples of Level 2
measurements are collateralized interest rate swaps, currency forwards, and cross-currency swaps that can be measured
using current interest rates or exchange rates."
"If the conditions for a Level 1 or Level 2 measurement are not met, a Level 3
measurement is applied."
"In such cases, major adjustments must be made to observable inputs or unobservable inputs must be
used."
"Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, originated loans and other receivables, investments in
equity instruments, and derivative financial assets."
They are measured at fair value upon initial recognition.
"For all financial
assets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition are taken into account plus, in the case of debt instruments held, a loss account for expected credit losses."
"The fair
values recognized in the statement of financial position are generally based on market prices of the financial assets."
"If these are
not available, the fair value is determined using standard valuation models on the basis of current market parameters."
"For the
classification and measurement of debt instruments held, the respective business model for managing the debt instruments
and whether the instruments have the characteristics of a standard loan, i.e., whether the cash flows are solely payments of
principal and interest, is relevant."
"Assuming the assets have these characteristics and if the business model is to hold to collect
the asset’s contractual cash flows, they are measured at amortized cost."
"If the objective of the business model is to hold to
collect and sell the contractual cash flows, they are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income with recycling
to profit or loss."
"In all other cases, financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"There may be different
business models for separate portfolios of the same types of debt instruments, for example if factoring transactions exist for
certain trade receivables."
Cash and cash equivalents include cash accounts and short-term cash deposits at banks.
"They have maturities of up to three
months at initial recognition."
Trade receivables are measured at their transaction price at initial recognition.
"Trade receivables with a significant financing
component are initially measured at fair value."
Investments in equity instruments represent strategic investments.
"Deutsche Telekom has exercised the option of generally
measuring these through other comprehensive income without recycling to profit or loss."
"The acquisition and disposal of
strategic investments is based on business policy considerations."
Dividends received are recognized immediately in profit or loss unless they constitute a repayment of capital.
"Derivative financial assets that are not part of an effective hedging relationship are measured at fair value through profit or
loss."
"In the consolidated statement of cash flows, Deutsche Telekom reports cash flows from interest and dividends received as
cash inflows or outflows in net cash from operating activities."
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition.
"For all financial liabilities not subsequently measured at fair
value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also a component of the carrying
amount."
"If the contractual payment term for liabilities to suppliers is longer than the normal credit period in the relevant procurement
market at this point in time, this liability is reported under other interest-bearing liabilities in financial liabilities instead of under
trade payables."
"A financing agreement of this nature is shown as a non-cash transaction in the consolidated statement of cash
flows and the relevant repayment of the financial liability is reported under net cash from/used in financing activities."
"This
applies regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable or not."

flows.”

"187
Derivative financial liabilities that are not part of an effective hedging relationship are measured at fair value through profit or
loss."
"Deutsche Telekom has not yet made use of the option to designate financial instruments upon initial recognition as at fair value
through profit or loss."
"At initial recognition, debt instruments held that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured including a
loss allowance account for expected credit losses."
"For trade receivables with and without a significant financing component,
contract assets, and lease assets, the loss allowance is calculated at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses."
"For
all other instruments, the loss allowance is determined at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit
risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition."
"Otherwise, the loss allowance is calculated
at an amount equal to twelve-month expected credit losses."
"In this case, losses incurred later than twelve months after the
reporting date would therefore not be considered."
"When determining the amount of loss allowances for financial assets, Deutsche Telekom applies impairment models that
are based on the historical probability of default and supplemented by the relevant future-oriented parameters."
"For debt
instruments traded in an active market, publicly available market data is used to determine the loss allowance for expected
credit losses."
"The loss allowance takes adequate account of the future expected credit risk; write-offs lead to the derecognition of the
respective receivables."
"Financial assets are grouped together on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics, tested
collectively for impairment, and written off, if necessary."
"Loss allowances for trade receivables are managed by the portfolio
managers of the individual business entities which have their own policies, procedures, and controls for the management of
customer default risk and take account of the circumstances in the respective market."
"They consider internal credit ratings and
empirical data on the customers’ solvency, as well as customer-specific risks, and make use of available external ratings and
estimates by collection agencies."
"The expected amount of a loss allowance is generally determined using a provision matrix
and will increase over time taking into account how long the balances have been past due."
"The loss allowance rates are updated
at regular intervals and adjusted to reflect current conditions and economic forecasts."
"For receivables and contract assets paid
in installments a weighted loss rate is calculated, which reflects the period in which the amounts to be paid by the customer
become due."
"A receivable is deemed past due, if the customer has not made the payment by the contractually agreed due date."
"In some cases, impairments are recognized using allowance accounts."
"The decision of whether to account for credit risks using
an allowance account or by directly reducing the receivable will depend on the reliability of the risk assessment and is also the
responsibility of the respective business entity."
"Receivables are derecognized if the efforts to collect them are not successful and the receivable balance is deemed to be
uncollectible."
"Deutsche Telekom uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate and currency risks resulting from its operating, financing, and
investing activities."
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative trading purposes.
"Derivatives are carried
at their fair value upon initial recognition and also for subsequent measurement."
"The fair value of traded derivatives is equal
to their market price, which can be positive or negative."
"If there is no market price available, the fair value is determined using
standard financial valuation models."
"The fair value of derivatives is the price that Deutsche Telekom would receive or have to pay if the financial instrument were
transferred at the reporting date."
"This is calculated on the basis of the counterparties’ relevant exchange rates and interest
rates at the reporting date."
Calculations are made using average rates.
"In the case of interest-bearing derivatives, a distinction
is made between the clean price and the dirty price (full fair value)."
"In contrast to the clean price, the dirty price also includes
the interest accrued."
The fair values carried correspond to the dirty price.
"These derivatives must then be recognized separately and measured at
fair value through profit or loss."
"Derivatives embedded in financial assets do not need to be separated, however."
"In such cases,
the entire instrument is rather to be measured at fair value provided the cash flows from the instrument are not solely payments
of principal and interest."

Recording the changes in the fair values – either in profit or loss or directly in equity – depends on whether or not the derivative
is part of an effective hedging relationship as set out in IFRS 9."
"If hedge accounting is not applied, the changes in the fair values
of the derivatives must be recognized immediately in profit or loss."
"If, on the other hand, effective hedge accounting exists, the
hedge will be recognized as such."
"Deutsche Telekom applies hedge accounting to hedged items in the statement of financial position and future cash flows, thus
reducing income statement volatility."
"A distinction is made between fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, and hedges of a net
investment in a foreign operation depending on the nature of the hedged item."
"Hedging relationships are exclusively accounted
for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9."
"Deutsche Telekom has exercised the option of designating cross-currency
basis spreads as hedging costs rather than as part of the hedging relationship and presenting them separately in equity."
"To
hedge the currency risk of an unrecognized firm commitment, Deutsche Telekom makes use of the option to recognize it as a
cash flow hedge rather than a fair value hedge."
"In the case of fair value hedges, the cumulative adjustments to the carrying
amount of the hedged item are amortized when the hedging relationship has been discontinued."
IFRS 9 sets out strict requirements on the use of hedge accounting.
"Deutsche Telekom complies with these requirements
by documenting, at the inception of a hedge, both the relationship between the financial instrument used as the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and the risk strategy of the hedge."
"This involves
concretely assigning the hedging instruments to the corresponding assets or liabilities or (firmly committed/highly probable)
future transactions and also assessing the effectiveness of the hedging instruments designated."
"The effectiveness of existing
hedging relationships is monitored on an ongoing basis."
"If the criteria for applying hedge accounting are no longer met, the
hedging relationship will be de-designated immediately."
"Contracts to buy a non-financial item that is physically settled, such as energy, are to be recognized as derivatives if the
contractually agreed delivery volume will not be used in full in own business operations."
"Possible use cases are contracts
under which a fixed percentage of the energy generated by a wind park or solar farm (physical power purchase agreements)
is to be purchased."
"If more energy were to be generated than is needed, the purchaser would have to resell the surplus if
they had no feasible option to store it temporarily."
"Alternatively, the supplier would sell the unneeded energy and charge
Deutsche Telekom the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the contractually agreed price (net settlement)."
"In
either case, the contract would have to be recognized as a derivative at fair value through profit or loss."
"To date, no material
contracts to be recognized as derivatives exist at Deutsche Telekom."
"The delivery volume stipulated in physical power purchase
agreements is always used in full in the Group’s own business operations."
"In order to ensure this, contracts have been concluded
with sufficiently low minimum purchase volumes."
There is no net settlement for volumes not purchased.
"Additional quantities
needed can either be purchased at a fixed price agreed in advance or at current market price."
"In order to achieve its climate
goals, Deutsche Telekom also acquires emission certificates under cash-settled energy forward agreements."
"For further information, please refer to Note 43 “Financial instruments and risk management.”
Insurance contracts
Deutsche Telekom recognizes a group of insurance contracts it issues from the earliest of the following:

the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts.
the date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due.
"for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous."
The coverage period of each contract in the group at initial recognition is less than one year.
"Hence, for measurement purposes,
Deutsche Telekom applies the premium allocation approach in accordance with IFRS 17."
"Any insurance acquisition cash flows
are recognized as expenses when those costs are incurred."
"In cases where the relevant criteria are met, service contracts for a
fixed fee are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15 rather than IFRS 17."

"Contingent liabilities are also present obligations that arise from past events for which an outflow of
resources embodying economic benefits is not probable or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with
sufficient reliability."
"Contingent liabilities are only recognized at their fair value if they were assumed in the course of a business
combination."
Contingent liabilities not assumed in the course of a business combination are not recognized.
"Contingent assets
are not recognized."
"However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is no longer a contingent
asset, but it is recognized as an asset."
"Information on contingent liabilities is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote."
"The same applies to
contingent assets where an inflow of economic benefits is probable."
"Leases
A lease is a contract in which the lessor conveys the right to use an asset for a period of time to the lessee in exchange for
consideration, typically a payment or series of payments."
"The scope of IFRS 16 applies to standard lease, rental, and tenancy
agreements as well as agreements in which the lessee is granted other rights to use assets, such as certain easements."
"A lease
only exists if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset to the lessee."
"The lessee has control when
it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset during the contract term and
the right to direct the use of the identified asset."
"At the commencement date of the lease, a lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the statement of
financial position for all leases."
"The right-of-use asset is measured applying the cost model and the lease liability is measured at
the present value of the future lease payments."
"This measurement concept also applies to leases for which the underlying asset
is of low value and to short-term leases for which the lease term is no longer than twelve months."
"Non-lease components are
not separated from lease components, i.e., all non-lease payments due under the contract are also recognized in the statement
of financial position."
"This practical expedient does not include contracts relating to data centers, which due to their special
requirements in terms of equipment and premises form their own separate class of underlying asset."
"For this class of assets,
the non-lease payments are recognized as an expense."
IAS 38 is applied for leases of intangible assets rather than IFRS 16.
"The lease liability is recognized at the present value of the future lease payments to be made over the reasonably certain
lease term."
"Lease payments are all of the fixed and in-substance fixed payments, less any future lease incentives payable by
the lessor."
"Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be payable under residual value
guarantees, and payments for the exercise of reasonably certain purchase and termination options are also measured and
recognized as part of the lease liability."
"The series of payments is discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that
rate cannot be readily determined, at the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate."
"The incremental borrowing rate is determined
by deriving benchmark interest rates for a period of up to 30 years from maturity-related risk-free interest rates."
"On this basis,
an adjustment is carried out to account for credit-risk premiums, country risks, and interest rate differentials between a bond
financing arrangement and the financing of individual lease transactions."
"All other variable payments are recognized as an
expense."
The lease liability is subsequently measured using the effective interest method.
"The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and, if
applicable, reduced by any impairment losses."
"If ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the
lease term, or if it is reasonably certain that a purchase or put option will be exercised, the right-of-use asset is depreciated
from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset."
The lease term is the period during which it is reasonably certain that an underlying asset will be used by the lessee.
"In addition
to the non-cancelable period of a lease, extensions will be included if their exercise is reasonably certain at the commencement
of the lease term."
"Early termination rights are not to be considered if it is reasonably certain that an existing termination
right will not be exercised."
"These estimates are reassessed either upon the occurrence of an event or a significant change in
circumstances that is within the control of the lessee and affects a change in lease term."
"The lease term will be revised if an
extension option or termination option is exercised or not exercised contrary to the original estimate."
"The revision of the lease
term leads to a change in the future series of lease payments and therefore to a remeasurement of the lease liability using a
revised current discount rate."
"The amount of the resulting difference is recognized outside profit or loss as an adjustment to the
right-of-use asset or is offset against it."
"Derecognition amounts that exceed the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset are
recognized as an income in profit or loss."

"If a lease modification decreases the scope of the lease, the lessee
also remeasures both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and recognizes any gain or loss in profit or loss."
"The modified
amounts are measured at the modification date with a revised discount rate."
"If a lease does not transfer substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the
lessee, the leased asset is recognized in the statement of financial position by the lessor (operating lease)."
"Measurement of
the leased asset is then based on the accounting policies applicable to the underlying asset."
"The lease payments, including
contractually defined future changes in the lease payments, are recognized by the lessor in profit or loss as revenue from the
use of entity assets by others in the scope of IFRS 16, because these payments constitute (monthly) recurring transactions."
"Contractually defined future changes in the lease payments during the term of the lease are recognized as lease revenue on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, which is assessed at the commencement date of the contract."
"Where extension options
exist, the exercises of those extension options that are reasonably certain are initially taken into account at the time the lease
is concluded."
"If, contrary to the original expectation, these options are exercised or not exercised during the lease term, the
previously assessed term will be revised and taken into account in the recognition of future lease revenue from operating lease
transactions."
"If substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying leased asset are transferred to the lessee (finance
lease), the lessor recognizes at the commencement date, in place of the leased asset, a finance lease receivable at an amount
equal to the net investment in the lease."
"The net investment is defined as the discounted aggregate of future lease payments
and any unguaranteed residual value accruing to the lessor (gross investment)."
"The lease payments made by the lessees are
split into an interest component and a principal component using the effective interest method."
"In subsequent measurement,
the lease receivable is reduced by the principal lease payments received."
"The interest component of the payments received is
recognized as finance income over the lease term in the consolidated income statement."
"The selling profit or loss from the finance lease is realized in the amount of the difference
between the revenue and the carrying amount of the underlying asset less the present value of the unguaranteed residual value."
The finance income (interest income) is subsequently also presented as lease revenue.
"Any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to
the buyer-lessor is recognized in profit or loss."
"If there is no transfer of control, the seller-lessee recognizes the transaction as
a financing transaction."
"While the transaction is legally subject to a lease contract, it is not accounted for as a lease and the
underlying asset is not derecognized in this case."
"Where shares in cell tower business companies are sold with loss of control
in accordance with IFRS 10 and simultaneous leaseback of part of the passive network infrastructure sold, a portion of the gain
is recognized on a pro rata basis in subsequent periods."
"Applying the sale-and-leaseback requirements, the gain on disposal is
calculated as the amount of the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor and the proportionate deferred gain is determined as the
amount that relates to the right of use retained."
"Share-based payment programs
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value on the grant date."
"The fair value of the obligation
is recognized as personnel costs over the vesting period and offset against capital reserves."
"For equity-settled share-based
payment transactions, the fair value is determined using internationally accepted valuation techniques, such as the Black-
Scholes model or the Monte Carlo model."
"For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods and services acquired
and the liability incurred are recognized at the fair value of the liability."
"The fair value of the liability has to be newly determined
at each reporting date and at the settlement date, and the changes in the fair value have to be recognized in profit and loss,
until the liability is settled."

Net revenue, contract assets and liabilities/contract costs
Revenues include all revenues from the ordinary business activities of Deutsche Telekom."
"Ordinary activities do not only refer
to the core business but also to other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services."
"However, gains from sales of items of
property, plant and equipment or intangible assets are not recognized as revenue but as other operating income."
"All ancillary
income in connection with the delivery of goods and rendering of services in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities is also
presented as revenue."
"Examples include dunning fees, contractual penalties, and default interest."
"Income from interest added
back from long-term customer receivables and contract assets is also considered ancillary income in the course of an entity’s
ordinary activities where the underlying receivables or contract assets have resulted in the recognition of revenue."
"Revenues
are recorded net of value-added tax and other taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities."
"They are recognized in accordance with the provision of goods or services, provided that collectability of the consideration is
probable."
"For service contracts with a continuous service provision, the contractually agreed total consideration is recognized
as revenue on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term, regardless of the payment pattern."
"A contract asset must be recognized when Deutsche Telekom recognized revenue for fulfillment of a contractual performance
obligation before the customer paid consideration or before – irrespective of when payment is due – the requirements for
billing and thus the recognition of a receivable exist."
"A contract liability must be recognized when the customer paid consideration or a receivable from the customer is due before
Deutsche Telekom fulfilled a contractual performance obligation and thus recognized revenue."
"In a customer contract, contract
liabilities must be set off against contract assets."
"Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services must be separated into
distinct performance obligations, each with its own separate revenue contribution that is recognized as revenue on fulfillment
of the obligation to the customer."
"At Deutsche Telekom, this especially concerns the sale or lease of a mobile handset or other
telecommunications equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed-network telecommunications contract."
"As a result, the revenue to be
recognized for products (often delivered in advance) such as mobile handsets that are sold at a subsidized price in combination
with a long-term service contract is higher than the amount billed or collected."
"This leads to the recognition of what is known
as a contract asset – a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the
statement of financial position."
"The contract asset is reversed and reduced over the remaining minimum contract period,
reducing revenue from the other performance obligations (in this case: mobile service revenues) compared with the amounts
billed."
"In contrast to the amounts billed, this results in higher revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise and lower
revenue from the provision of services."
The same applies to fees for installation and set-up activities that do not have an independent value for the customer.
"The measure of significance is whether the decision by the (average) customer to
enter into the current contract is likely to have been significantly influenced by their right to the future discount."
"The
discount rate also reflects the customer credit risk."
"Deutsche Telekom makes use of the option not to recognize a significant
financing component if the period between when a good or service is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays
for that good or service will be one year or less."

net recognition of revenues.
The determining factor is control over the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer.
"The
assessment determines whether the company must recognize revenue on a gross basis (as a principal) or net of the costs
incurred to the supplier (as an agent), i.e., only in the amount of the remaining margin."
"For Deutsche Telekom, the question
arises particularly in the case of (branded) digital products (e.g., streaming services, software licenses, cloud-based software as
a service) provided by and purchased from third parties and sold to customers as part of Deutsche Telekom’s product portfolio."
"Contract costs comprise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-
party retailers in the direct and indirect sales channel) and the costs to fulfill a contract."
"These must be capitalized if it can be
assumed that the costs will be compensated by future revenue from the contract."
"Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are
additional costs that would not have been incurred had the contract not been concluded."
"Costs to fulfill a contract are costs
relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are
incurred prior to fulfillment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard."
"Deutsche Telekom makes use of the option to
immediately recognize contract costs whose amortization period would not be more than one year as an expense."
The capitalized contract costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected contract period.
"The expenses
are disclosed in Deutsche Telekom’s income statement, not under depreciation and amortization but – depending on the sales
channel – as goods and services purchased or personnel costs."
"In the indirect sales channel, third-party retailers often arrange service contracts on behalf of and for the account of
Deutsche Telekom (as the agent) in connection with the sale of subsidized handsets in their own name and for their own
account (as the principal)."
"In such cases, the retailers receive commission in an amount that explicitly or implicitly compensates
them for the handset subsidy granted."
"As in the case of multiple-element arrangements in the direct sales channel, the
customer ultimately covers the handset subsidy by paying a price above the standalone selling price for the service contract."
"Deutsche Telekom considers this an implicit promise to the customer that on conclusion of this service contract they will be
able to purchase a handset at a discounted price."
"This ensures that the amount of the service revenues generated
with retail customers for identical rate plans does not depend on the type of sales channel."
"Revenue generated from the use of voice and data communications as well
as television via internet is recognized upon rendering of the agreed service."
"The services rendered relate to use by customers
(e.g., call minutes), availability over time (e.g., monthly flat rates), or other agreed rate plans."
"Revenue and expenses associated
with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are recognized when the products are delivered, provided
there are no unfulfilled company obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement."
"Revenue from the
lease of mobile handsets and telecommunications equipment that is not considered a sale in economic terms is recognized
monthly as the entitlement to the fees accrued."
"Advertising revenues are recognized in the period in which the advertisements
are exhibited."

Particularly in the mobile communications business, the timing of payments for mobile handsets purchased in connection
with the conclusion of a service contract differs from the timing of the delivery and hence from revenue recognition."
"Where
a significant financing component exists, revenue is measured at the present value."
"In both the subsidy model and the payment-by-installment model,
an asset must thus be recognized at the date of revenue recognition and is generally settled over a 24-month service contract
term through payments made by the customer."
"The only difference is that with the subsidy model it is a contract asset that is
repaid through the portion of the monthly bill that exceeds the allocated monthly service revenues."
"By contrast, the payment-
by-installment model involves an existing legal customer receivable that is settled based on an installment plan – separately
from the monthly billing for telecommunications services."
"The Systems Solutions operating segment provides, among other things, IT services and network services for corporate
customers including IT outsourcing services and the sale of hardware including desktop services."
"Revenue from service
contracts is recognized as the service is performed, i.e., normally on a pro rata basis over the contract term."
"Revenue from
service contracts billed on the basis of time and material used is recognized at the contractual hourly rates as labor hours are
delivered and direct expenses are incurred."
"Revenue from hardware sales or sales-type leases is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer, provided there
are no unfulfilled company obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement."
"Any costs of these
obligations are recognized when the corresponding revenue is recognized."
"Revenue from construction contracts and construction-type service contracts (or elements of service contracts), for which a
defined output is promised (e.g., IT developments), is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method."
"The measure of
progress or stage of completion of a contract is generally determined as the percentage of cost incurred up until the reporting
date relative to the total estimated cost at the reporting date (cost-to-cost method)."
"In particular for complex outsourcing
contracts with corporate customers, a reliable estimate of the total cost and therefore of the stage of completion is not possible
in many cases, so revenue is only recognized in the amount of the contract costs expensed."
"This means that a proportionate
profit is not realized until the contract has been completed (zero-profit method)."
Revenue from non-sales-type rentals and leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
"Income taxes
Income taxes include current income taxes as well as deferred taxes."
"Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities must be
recognized where they are probable."
"They are measured in accordance with the tax laws applicable or already announced as of
the reporting date, provided said announcement has the effect of actual enactment."
"Where uncertain tax assets or uncertain
tax liabilities are recognized because they are probable, these must be measured at their most probable amount."
"In exceptional
cases the expected value is considered."
"Current tax assets and current tax liabilities must be recognized in the amount that Deutsche Telekom expects to settle with or
recover from the tax authorities."
They include liabilities/receivables for the current period as well as for prior periods.
"Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated statement of
financial position and the tax base, as well as for tax loss carryforwards and tax credits."
"Nor is a deferred tax liability recognized for temporary differences
arising from the initial recognition of goodwill."

Judgments and estimates
The presentation of the results of operations or financial position in the consolidated financial statements is dependent upon
and sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions, and estimates."
The actual amounts may differ from those estimates.
"Measurement of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the use of estimates for determining the fair
value at the acquisition date, provided they were acquired in a business combination."
"Furthermore, the expected useful lives
of these assets must be estimated."
"The determination of the fair values of assets and liabilities, as well as of the useful lives of
the assets is based on management’s judgment."
"The measurement of intangible assets acquired in barter transactions is based
on management’s judgment as to whether a barter transaction has commercial substance."
"For this, an analysis is performed
to determine to what extent the future cash flows (risk, timing, and amount) are expected to change as a consequence of the
transaction."
Information from external experts is obtained for this analysis and for the determination of the fair values of assets.
"The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and right-of-use assets involves the
use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing, and amount of the impairment."
"If the demand for these products and services did not materialize as expected,
this would result in less revenue, less cash flow, and potential impairment."
"In addition, when determining fair values, further
planning uncertainties that reflect the risks of macroeconomic development could adversely affect future results of operations."
"Inflation, energy prices, and expectations of inflation and energy price rises as well as their impact on revenue (when passed
on to customers) and costs are included in impairment tests via the planning approved by management."
"Risk management
also identifies new risks and additionally takes into account any such risks that would have a significant impact and change an
impairment test."
The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates by management.
"Methods used to calculate the recoverable amount include discounted cash flow-based methods and methods that use market
prices as a basis."
"The discounted cash flow valuations refer to projections that are based on financial plans that have been
approved by management and are also used for internal purposes."
"The chosen planning horizon reflects the assumptions for
short- to medium-term market developments and is selected to achieve a steady state in the business outlook that is necessary
for calculating the perpetual annuity."
"This steady state will only be reached based on the planning horizon selected, in particular
due to the sometimes long investment cycles in the telecommunications industry and the investments planned and expected
in the long run to acquire and extend spectrum licenses."
"Cash flows beyond the internal mid-term planning are extrapolated
using appropriate growth rates defined separately for each cash-generating unit."
"These growth rates are based on real growth
and inflation expected in the long term for the countries in which the respective unit operates."
"To achieve the sustainable
growth rates set for the period of the perpetual annuity, additional sustainable investments derived specifically for each cash-
generating unit are taken into account."
"Discount
rates are determined on the basis of external figures derived from the market, taking account of the risks associated with
the cash-generating unit (market and country risks)."
"Any future changes in the aforementioned assumptions could have a
significant impact on the fair values of the cash-generating units."
"Changes in the assumptions may have a negative impact, as
a result of future macroeconomic trends, continued intense competition, further possible legislation changes (e.g., as part of
national austerity programs), and regulatory intervention."

Management recognizes allowances for (doubtful) accounts to account for expected losses resulting from payment default of
customers."
"When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for (doubtful) accounts, management bases its estimates on the
aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write-off experience, customer creditworthiness, and changes in customer
payment terms."
"If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, actual write-offs might be higher than expected."
"In each tax jurisdiction in which Deutsche Telekom operates, management must make judgments for the calculation of current
and deferred taxes."
"This is relevant, for example, when it comes to a decision on recognizing deferred tax assets because it
must be probable that a taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, loss carryforwards,
and tax credits can be utilized."
"In addition to the estimate of future earnings, various factors are used to assess the probability
of the future utilization of deferred tax assets, including past results of operations, the reliability of planning, and tax planning
strategies."
"The period used for the assessment of the recoverability depends on the circumstances at the respective Group
company and typically is in a range of five to ten years."
Pension obligations for benefits to non-civil servants are generally satisfied by defined benefit plans.
"Pension benefit costs for
non-civil servants are determined in accordance with actuarial valuations, which rely on assumptions regarding the discount
rate, the expected salary increase rate, the expected pension trend, and life expectancy."
"In the event that changes in the
assumptions regarding these parameters are required, the future amounts of the pension benefit costs may be affected
materially."
"The Civil Service Health Insurance Fund provides services mainly in cases of illness, birth, or death for its
members, who are civil servants employed by or retired from Deutsche Telekom AG, Deutsche Post AG, and Deutsche
Postbank AG, and their relatives."
"When Postreform II came into effect, participation in the Civil Service Health Insurance Fund
was closed to new members."
"Since the calculation of these provisions involves long-term projections over periods of more than
50 years, the present value of the liability may be highly sensitive even to small variations in the underlying assumptions."
"Deutsche Telekom exercises considerable judgment in measuring and recognizing provisions and contingent liabilities related
to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration, or government
regulation."
"Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to
quantify the possible range of the final settlement."
"Provisions are recognized for losses from executory contracts, provided a
loss is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated."
"Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process,
actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision."
"In addition, significant estimates are involved in the
determination of provisions related to taxes and litigation risks."
"These estimates are subject to change as new information
becomes available, primarily with the support of internal specialists or with the support of outside consultants, such as
actuaries or legal counsel."
"Revisions to the estimates of these losses from executory contracts may significantly affect future
results of operations."
"Revenue recognition, contract assets and liabilities/contract costs
The determination of the transaction price may also be subject to estimates and assumptions, especially in the case of variable
consideration, e.g., performance bonuses paid out at the end of a contract."
"Where the variable consideration leads to a reduction in the payment entitlement or a repayment obligation on the
part of Deutsche Telekom (e.g., in the case of volume discounts), the fixed contractual payment must be set lower accordingly."
"In the case of variable discounts, the non-inclusion of the variable consideration means that these as-yet unknown discounts
are generally taken into account with a reducing effect on the transaction price."

The standalone selling prices of individual products or services that are part of multiple-element arrangements are complex to
determine, because some of the elements are price-sensitive and, thus, volatile in a competitive marketplace."
"In many cases,
standalone selling prices can also not be observed for the company’s own products."
"Due to the fact that comparability is
generally not completely assured, the use of market prices for similar products is subject to an element of uncertainty, as is an
estimate using a cost-plus-margin approach."
"One-time payments by the customer for contracts that can be terminated at any time are recognized over an expected
contract period, the length of which depends on the period over which, from a commercial perspective, the customer is
expected to renew or not terminate the contract on a monthly basis."
Contract costs are deferred and generally recognized as expense over the expected contract period.
"The estimate of the
expected average contract period is based on historical customer turnover."
"However, this is subject to fluctuations and has only
limited informative value with regard to future customer behavior, particularly if new products are rolled out."
"If management’s
estimates are revised, material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for subsequent periods."
The significance of material rights is an estimate that is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.
"This is ultimately
a matter of judgment, even though it is supported by quantitative facts."
"Depending on the decision as to whether or not the
customer has a material right to be deferred, there may be material differences in the amount and timing of revenues for the
current and subsequent periods."
"Extension and termination options for the lessee
Extension and termination options are included in many lease arrangements across the Deutsche Telekom Group."
"Local
entities are responsible for managing their individual leases."
"As a result, lease contracts include different terms and conditions."
"The main population of lease contracts in the Deutsche Telekom Group comprises arrangements for cell site infrastructure,
land/ground underneath the infrastructure, switch sites, office buildings, and retail stores, which are mainly located in the
United States and Germany."
The length of the lease term in these contracts is the main factor in measuring the lease liabilities.
"The majority of cell site leases in the United States have an initial non-cancelable term of 5 to 15 years, with several renewal
options that can extend the lease term from five to 35 years."
"Cell site leases in Germany, on the other hand, have an initial non-
cancelable period of eight years, during which the lease cannot be terminated."
"After this initial period of time, the lease extends
automatically if the lessee does not terminate the lease."
"Unless terminated by the lessee, leases extend by a maximum of eight
years twice and six years once."
"In the event of termination, the sites can be used for up to another five years."
"In determining the lease term, management applies judgment and considers all facts and circumstances that create an
economic incentive for Deutsche Telekom to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option."
"Extension
options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if Deutsche Telekom is reasonably certain to
exercise an option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease."

Deutsche Telekom."
"With the sale of the GD tower companies, for cell sites contracts in Germany,
a lease term of eight years for the entire portfolio is considered reasonably certain."
"Increasing uncertainty about future changes
in the telecommunications market and strategic considerations are important factors in this assessment."
"Extension options
after that period are typically not considered reasonably certain at commencement of the lease."
"Payments associated with
these optional periods are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities."
"Most extension options for office and shop leases are not included in the lease liability because Deutsche Telekom could replace
the leased assets without significant cost or business disruption."
"Exposure to future additional cash outflows will only arise when an extension option (not determined to be reasonably certain)
is exercised or when a termination option (determined to be reasonably certain) is not exercised."
"After the commencement date, the likelihood of exercising an option is only reassessed if a significant event or a significant
change in circumstances occurs that affects this judgment, and this is within the control of the lessee."
"Deutsche Telekom
reassesses the lease term when an option is exercised (or not exercised) or Deutsche Telekom becomes obligated to exercise or
not to exercise it."
"For further information on undiscounted future lease payments, please refer to Note 13 “Financial liabilities and lease liabilities.”
Consolidation methods
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by Deutsche Telekom."
"Control only exists if an investor has
power over the investee, is exposed to variable returns or has rights to variable returns, and is able to use its power to affect
the amount of variable returns."
"The existence of substantive potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible,
including potential voting rights held by other Group companies, are considered when assessing whether an entity is controlled."
"If the 1 % limit is exceeded, Deutsche Telekom determines which
companies are to be included in the consolidated financial statements, taking the long-term development of the investment
and consolidation effects into account."
"Aside from the quantitative criteria, qualitative criteria will also be used to assess the
materiality of an entity for the consolidated group."
"Excluding a subsidiary must not significantly change the segment result
or the Group’s profit/loss for the year, nor may other significant trends be ignored."
"Subsidiaries that are not included in the
consolidated financial statements due to their subordinate significance are recognized under other assets."
"Rapidly advancing and ever-changing technology in the telecommunications industry requires flexible lease contracts, i.e.,
management tries to minimize longer periods during which the contracts cannot be canceled."
Often leasehold improvements can be used in alternative locations.
"In many cases, the costs of moving or replacing the asset
or initial construction costs are not the main factor considered when determining whether to extend or not to extend the
lease."
"Significant investments made in a location, e.g., construction of towers and masts on the leased land, are economic penalties
typically considered when determining the lease term."

Income and expenses of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date and remain
included in the consolidated financial statements until the date on which the parent company ceases to control the subsidiary."
"If necessary, the subsidiaries’ accounting principles will be aligned with the uniform accounting principles applied by the
Deutsche Telekom Group."
"Intercompany income and expenses, receivables and liabilities, and profits or losses are eliminated."
"Joint operations, joint ventures, and associates
Joint arrangements, in which two or more parties have joint control over an activity, must be classified as either joint operations
or joint ventures."
"A joint operation is characterized by the fact that the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (joint operators) have
rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement."
"A joint operator accounts for the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in the joint operation as well as its share of the joint assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses."
"In a joint venture, on the other hand, the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (partners) have rights to the net
assets of the entity."
"Associates are companies on which Deutsche Telekom has a significant influence, and that are neither
subsidiaries nor joint ventures."
"As with joint ventures, associates are accounted for using the equity method."
"Investments in joint ventures and associates that are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method
are recognized at cost at the time of acquisition."
"The carrying amount of the investment may include goodwill as the positive
difference between the cost of the investment and Deutsche Telekom’s proportionate share in the fair values of the entity’s
identifiable net assets."
"If necessary, the accounting principles of joint ventures and associates will be aligned with the uniform
accounting principles applied by the Deutsche Telekom Group."
"The carrying amount of the investment accounted for using the
equity method is tested for impairment provided there are indications of impairment."
"If the carrying amount of the investment
exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss must be recognized in the amount of the difference."
"The recoverable
amount is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use."
"The materiality assessment for jointly controlled entities and associates is generally performed using the same methods as
for subsidiaries, but is limited to the criteria of profit/loss for the year, contingent assets and liabilities, and other financial
obligations."
"Business combinations
A business combination exists when Deutsche Telekom obtains control of another entity."
"All business combinations must
be accounted for using the acquisition method."
"The cost of an acquired subsidiary is measured at the fair value of the
consideration transferred, i.e., the sum of the assets transferred, liabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued."
"Transaction
costs are generally recognized as expense."
"The acquisition cost is allocated to the acquired assets, liabilities, and contingent
liabilities."
"The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized in full at their fair
values at the acquisition date, regardless of the level of the investment held by Deutsche Telekom."
Any difference arising on the revaluation of equity interests previously held by Deutsche Telekom is recognized in profit or loss.

"199
For all business combinations there is an option in relation to the measurement of the non-controlling interests."
"These can be
recognized either directly at their fair value (i.e., the non-controlling interest in the enterprise value of the acquiree) or at the
non-controlling interest in the fair value of the net assets acquired."
"Transactions relating to the further acquisition or sale of equity interests with other shareholders that do not affect
Deutsche Telekom’s controlling interest do not lead to any change in goodwill."
"Changes in the composition of the Group and other transactions
In the 2023 financial year, Deutsche Telekom conducted the following transactions, which had an impact on the composition
of the Group."
"Other changes to the composition of the Group not shown here were of no material significance for
Deutsche Telekom’s consolidated financial statements."
"Sale of the GD tower companies
On July 13, 2022, Deutsche Telekom agreed to sell a 51.0 % stake in the cell tower business companies in Germany and Austria

"Wireline Business
On September 6, 2022, T‑Mobile US reached an agreement with Cogent Infrastructure (Cogent) on the sale of T‑Mobile US’
fiber-optic-based Wireline Business."
"Under the agreement, Cogent will take over all shares in the entity that holds all of the
assets and liabilities related to the former Sprint’s fiber-optic-based wireline network."
"The transaction was consummated on
May 1, 2023."
All necessary regulatory approvals had been duly granted and all other closing conditions met.
"The sale price
was USD 1 and was subject to customary adjustments laid down in the purchase agreement."
"The cash proceeds received upon
completion of the transaction amounted to USD 14 million (EUR 13 million)."
"The loss on deconsolidation resulting from the sale
amounted to EUR 4 million."
"In addition, upon completion of the transaction, T‑Mobile US undertook to enter into a separate
agreement on IP transit services, according to which T‑Mobile US will pay a total of USD 0.7 billion (around EUR 0.6 billion) in
agreed installments in subsequent periods to Cogent."
"In connection with the payment obligations entered into as part of the
transaction, total liabilities of EUR 0.7 billion had already been recognized in the 2022 financial year."
"These liabilities included,
under financial liabilities, the present value of the future payments for IP transit services."
"Since a specific use for these services
has not been identified, the corresponding expense was already recognized in full in the 2022 financial year under other
operating expenses."
"As a result of the concluded sales agreement, the assets and liabilities of the Wireline Business were reported in the
consolidated statement of financial position as “held for sale” from September 30, 2022 up until their sale on May 1, 2023."
"The purchase price is
variable dependent upon specified performance indicators of Ka’ena Corporation and consists of an upfront payment at deal
close, subject to certain agreed-upon adjustments, and a variable earnout payable 24 months after the close of the transaction."
The upfront payment is expected to be a revised amount of around USD 1.2 billion (before working capital adjustments).
"The
transaction is subject to approval by the authorities as well as other customary closing conditions and is expected to close
around the end of the first quarter of 2024."

Deutsche Telekom AG’s shareholder remuneration
The Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG proposes to the shareholders’ meeting a dividend for the 2023 financial
year of EUR 0.77 per dividend-bearing share."
"On November 2, 2023, the Board of Management additionally announced plans
to buy back Deutsche Telekom AG shares up to a total purchase price of EUR 2 billion in the 2024 financial year as part of a
share buy-back program."
"The buy-back commenced on January 3, 2024 and will be carried out in several tranches through
December 31, 2024."
"The purpose of the share buy-back is to recoup part of the dilution effect from Deutsche Telekom AG’s
2021 capital increase."
The repurchased shares will therefore be canceled.
"In the period from January 3, 2024 to February 13, 2024, Deutsche Telekom AG bought back around 9 million shares with a
total volume of EUR 0.2 billion under the share buy-back program."
"This
puts the total number of shares that have been repurchased since the program’s inception in September 2022 at around
98.8 million at a price of USD 14.0 billion (EUR 13.2 billion)."
"The budget for the share buy-back program was therefore fully
exhausted by the end of September 2023."
"T‑Mobile US’ shareholder return program from September 2023
On September 6, 2023, T‑Mobile US announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a shareholder return program of up
to USD 19 billion that will run from October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024."
"The program comprises additional share buy-
backs and dividends to be paid out."
"The amount available for share buy-backs will be reduced by the amount of any dividends
approved by the Board of Directors of T‑Mobile US."
"On September 25, 2023, the T‑Mobile US Board of Directors declared an initial cash dividend of USD 0.65 per share, which was
paid out on December 15, 2023 to the shareholders registered as of close of business on December 1, 2023."
"EUR 0.4 billion of
the cash dividend was attributable to Deutsche Telekom’s stake and EUR 0.3 billion to non-controlling interests in T‑Mobile US."
"In the 2023 financial year, T‑Mobile US bought back 15.5 million shares with a total volume of USD 2.2 billion (EUR 2.0 billion)
under its share buy-back program."
"On January 24, 2024, the T‑Mobile US Board of Directors declared a further cash dividend of USD 0.65 per share, which will
be paid out on March 14, 2024 to the shareholders registered as of close of business on March 1, 2024."
"Furthermore, in the
period from January 1, 2024 to January 31, 2024, T‑Mobile US bought back a further 9 million shares with a total volume of
USD 1.5 billion (around EUR 1.4 billion) under its share buy-back program."
"The condition of the Letter Agreement that the volume-
weighted price of T‑Mobile US shares reach or exceed USD 149.35 (after adjusting for the first cash dividend by T‑Mobile US)
for 45 days was satisfied on December 22, 2023."
The shares were issued from the treasury shares held by T‑Mobile US.
"As a result, Deutsche Telekom’s stake in T‑Mobile US declined and amounted to 47.9 % as of December 31, 2023."
"Taking
the treasury shares held by T‑Mobile US into account, Deutsche Telekom’s ownership stake in T‑Mobile US stood at 50.6 %
as of December 31, 2023."
"The shares issued to SoftBank are subject to the proxy agreement between SoftBank and
Deutsche Telekom."
"The percentage of T‑Mobile US shares for which Deutsche Telekom can exercise voting rights, based on the
agreement concluded with SoftBank in connection with the acquisition of Sprint, amounted to 58.0 % as of December 31, 2023."
"Sale of T‑Mobile US shares by Deutsche Telekom
In early 2024, Deutsche Telekom began selling a portion of its T‑Mobile US share portfolio on the market, without jeopardizing
its own majority ownership position in T‑Mobile US."
"In the period from January 2, 2024 to February 13, 2024, Deutsche Telekom
sold around 5 million T‑Mobile US shares with a total volume of EUR 0.9 billion."

conditions, weak trade growth, and diminished business and consumer confidence are negatively impacting the economic
outlook."
Growing geopolitical tensions are further contributing to increased uncertainty about the economic outlook.
"Deutsche Telekom is aware that, in view of the current developments, it is only possible to extrapolate past experience to
the future to a limited extent."
"Deutsche Telekom continues to address these challenges and considers them in its business
decisions in the course of developing measures to mitigate the risks."
"For instance, interest rate risks are countered by reducing
the variable-interest debt portfolio."
"With respect to energy supply, Deutsche Telekom’s national companies pursue different
procurement strategies, e.g., by concluding power purchase agreements, to balance long-term supply reliability and
appropriate prices."
"For further information on risk mitigation measures, please refer to the section “Risk and opportunity management” in the combined management report."
"Deutsche Telekom also considers the development of the economic environment in its consolidated financial statements and
financial reporting, e.g., when determining the impairment of goodwill, the recognition of deferred taxes, and the measurement

Impact of climate change
In the 2023 financial year, Deutsche Telekom analyzed potential sustainability risks in the areas of climate change and scarcity
of resources."
Climate change risks are already visible in the form of increasingly extreme weather conditions.
"Such storm events
could damage the infrastructure and disrupt network operation with direct or indirect effects on operations."
"The risk is assessed
in relation to the continuation of operations as part of risk management and is managed at an operational level in the business
units."
"Deutsche Telekom can take further action to help prevent climate change and to conserve resources by reducing its own
CO2 emissions."
"For this reason, Deutsche Telekom has set itself the goal of achieving climate neutrality in the Company by
the end of 2025 (Scope 1 and 2)."
"As a new interim goal on our journey towards climate neutrality along the entire value
chain, Deutsche Telekom has committed to reducing CO2 emissions across Scopes 1 to 3 by 55 % in absolute terms by 2030
compared with 2020."
"Deutsche Telekom then wants to reach net zero across all three scopes along the entire value chain by
2040."
"Since 2021, the Group has covered 100 % of its electricity requirement with renewable energy."
"This is achieved through
power purchase agreements and other forms of direct purchase, such as through guarantees of origin."
"Climate protection also carries financial risks, whether from the introduction of levies on CO2 emissions or increased energy
costs, as well as stricter requirements for products, for example in relation to energy efficiency."
"The measures
Deutsche Telekom is taking to counter these risks include measuring the Group’s own energy efficiency and finding ways to
improve it."
"The ESG targets agreed from 2021 for Board of Management remuneration in relation to the respective annual
energy consumption as well as the planned annual CO2 emissions for Scope 1 and 2 also contribute to achieving the climate
targets and energy efficiency measures."

The carrying amount of intangible assets decreased by EUR 4.6 billion to EUR 136.0 billion, mainly due to amortization and
impairment losses of EUR 6.6 billion."
This includes impairment losses of EUR 0.1 billion.
"Exchange rate effects, primarily from
the translation of U.S."
"dollars into euros, also decreased the carrying amount by EUR 3.9 billion."
"Disposals reduced the carrying
amount by EUR 0.1 billion."
"By contrast, capital expenditure had an increasing effect of EUR 5.9 billion on the carrying amount."
EUR 1.0 billion of this related to the acquisition of mobile spectrum in the United States and Europe operating segments.
"For further information on amortization and impairment losses, please refer to Note 27 “Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses.”
Expenditure on research and development recognized as an expense by Deutsche Telekom amounted to EUR 25.1 million in the
reporting year (2022: EUR 30.3 million)."
"Impairment losses recognized in the 2023 financial year on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and right-of-use
assets totaled EUR 0.2 billion (2022: EUR 1.2 billion)."
"This was the result of the following effects:
Impairment losses on non-current assets in the Systems Solutions operating segment and in the Group Headquarters
& Group Services segment."
"In the 2023 financial year, impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment totaling EUR 150 million were recognized in the Systems Solutions cash-generating unit."
"These related to follow-
up investments in connection with assets previously impaired in the 2020 to 2022 financial years."
"Furthermore, despite the
business outlook remaining positive, the further increase in the cost of capital in the reporting year prompted yet another
impairment loss to be recognized on non-current assets at the end of 2023."
"The recoverable amount – determined as fair
value less costs of disposal – was calculated at EUR 935 million, which is EUR 104 million lower than the carrying amount of
the Systems Solutions cash-generating unit."
"The fair values of the individual assets were set as the lower limit for the amount
of the impairment loss."
An external expert opinion was obtained to determine the fair values of the individual assets.
"The
value was calculated using Level 3 input parameters."
A discount rate of 8.63 % was used.
"EUR 70 million of the impairment

to the Systems Solutions cash-generating unit for the purposes of impairment testing."
"The following impairment losses on non-current assets were recognized in the prior year:
Impairment losses on non-current assets in the United States operating segment."
"In the second quarter of 2022, T‑Mobile US
decommissioned the former Sprint’s 3G CDMA network and began switching off the former Sprint’s 4G LTE network, which was
completed in the third quarter of 2022."
"Until now, the operation of these networks has been supported by Sprint’s own fiber-
optic-based wireline network."
"Due to the decommissioning of Sprint’s mobile networks, the assets of Sprint’s fiber-optic-based wireline network generated
cash inflows independently of the assets of the mobile business."
"As such, they were no longer assigned to the United States
cash-generating unit."
"This resulted in an ad hoc impairment test of the fiber-optic-based wireline assets as of June 30, 2022."
"The fair value of the assets was determined using the combination of cost-, income-, and market value-based approaches,
including assumptions of the market participants."

On September 6, 2022, T‑Mobile US had reached an agreement with Cogent on the sale of the fiber-optic-based Wireline
Business of the former Sprint."
"The sale price was USD 1 and was subject to customary adjustments laid down in the purchase
agreement."
"As a result of the purchase agreement concluded, the assets of the Wireline Business were reclassified as of
September 30, 2022 to non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale."
"The remeasurement of these assets at the
lower of carrying amount and fair value based on the purchase price less costs of disposal resulted in an impairment loss of
EUR 375 million as of the date of the reclassification."
"EUR 300 million of the impairment loss related to property, plant and
equipment, EUR 71 million to right-of-use assets, and EUR 4 million to intangible assets."
"Impairment losses on non-current assets in the Systems Solutions operating segment and in the Group Headquarters
& Group Services segment."
"In the 2022 financial year, impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment totaling EUR 144 million were recognized."
"This was a consequence of several factors, including the ad hoc
impairment testing carried out in the Systems Solutions cash-generating unit in 2021, and related to follow-up investments."
"Despite the positive business outlook, the increase in the cost of capital in the financial year prompted further impairment
losses to be recognized on non-current assets in the Systems Solutions cash-generating unit at the end of 2022."
"The
recoverable amount – determined as fair value less costs of disposal – was calculated at EUR 478 million, which is
EUR 351 million lower than the carrying amount of the Systems Solutions cash-generating unit."
"The fair values of the individual
assets were set as the lower limit for the amount of the impairment loss."
"An external expert opinion was obtained to determine
the fair values of the individual assets."

Impairment losses on non-current assets in the Europe operating segment (Romania).
"In the 2022 financial year, impairment
losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment totaling EUR 117 million were recognized."
"These related to the
Romania cash-generating unit, which operates in the structurally challenging and highly competitive Romanian market."
"In
addition, high energy prices and sharp rises in interest rates had a negative impact on the enterprise value."
"The value in use was
calculated at EUR 41 million, which is EUR 116 million lower than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit."
"A discount
rate of 9.48 % was used."

"In the 2023 financial year, the carrying amount of goodwill in cash-generating units in the operating segments decreased by
EUR 0.4 billion to EUR 20.3 billion."
"This was the result of the following effects:
United States operating segment."
"The decrease in goodwill of EUR 0.4 billion compared with December 31, 2022 primarily
relates to exchange rate effects from the translation of U.S."
Europe operating segment.
"Changes in goodwill in the cash-generating units Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic result
from exchange rate effects."
Disclosures on annual impairment tests.
"As of December 31, 2023, Deutsche Telekom carried out its annual impairment tests
on the goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (in particular, FCC licenses in the United States) assigned to
the cash-generating units."
"The recoverable amounts to be identified for the impairment tests were largely determined on the basis of the fair values
less costs of disposal."
"With the exception of the United States cash-generating unit (Level 1 measurement), these figures were
calculated using the net present value method."
The main parameters are shown in the following table.
"The impairment tests on
goodwill as of December 31, 2023 did not result in any need for impairment in the cash-generating units."
"Likewise no need for
impairment had been identified in the cash-generating units at the reporting date of the prior year."
"The recoverable amounts at the cash-generating units Croatia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia were determined using the
value in use."
"The market price of an active and liquid market (share price) of T‑Mobile US was used to determine the fair value
less costs of disposal in the case of the United States cash-generating unit."
"The measurements of all other cash-generating
units, as for the value in use, are founded on projections for a ten-year projection period that are based on financial plans
that have been approved by management and are also used for internal purposes."
"The chosen planning horizon reflects the
assumptions for short- to medium-term market developments and is selected to achieve a steady state in the business outlook
that is necessary for calculating the perpetual annuity."
"This steady state can only be established based on this planning horizon,
in particular due to the sometimes long investment cycles in the telecommunications industry and the investments planned
and expected in the long run to acquire and extend the rights of spectrum use."
"Cash flows beyond the internal mid-term
planning are extrapolated using appropriate growth rates defined separately for each cash-generating unit."
"These growth rates
are based on real growth and inflation expected in the long term for the countries in which the respective unit operates."
"To
achieve the sustainable growth rates set for the period of the perpetual annuity, additional sustainable investments derived
specifically for each cash-generating unit are taken into account."
"211
data and estimates: development of revenue, customer acquisition and retention costs, churn rates, capital expenditure,
market share, and growth rates."
"Discount rates are determined on the basis of external figures derived from the market,
taking account of the market and country risks associated with the cash-generating unit."
"Any significant future changes in the
aforementioned assumptions would have an impact on the fair values of the cash-generating units."
"Changes in the assumptions
may have a negative impact, as a result of future macroeconomic trends, continued intense competition, further possible
legislation changes (e.g., as part of national austerity programs), and regulatory intervention."

the acquisition of spectrum licenses in the 600 MHz band for an aggregate purchase price of USD 3.5 billion (EUR 3.2 billion)."
The licenses are to be acquired without any associated network assets.
"T‑Mobile US currently utilizes these licenses under
an existing arrangement with the Sellers covering fixed-term spectrum leases."
"On March 30, 2023, the contractual parties
further agreed that the transaction be divided into two separate tranches."
"The transfer of the licenses in accordance with the
agreements is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions."
"The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) approved the first tranche of the license transfer on December 29, 2023."
"T‑Mobile US expects the first
tranche to be concluded in the second quarter of 2024, and the second tranche in late 2024/early 2025."
"On September 12, 2023, T‑Mobile US agreed with U.S."
"cable network operator Comcast to acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz
band in exchange for total cash consideration of between USD 1.2 billion and USD 3.3 billion (EUR 1.1 billion and
EUR 3.0 billion)."
"The final purchase price will be determined at the time the parties make the required transfer filings with the
FCC once it is decided which spectrum Comcast intends to sell."
"The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2028,
pending approval from the FCC."
"At the same time, T‑Mobile US and Comcast have agreed exclusive leasing arrangements."
"The
leasing rights for T‑Mobile US will apply for at least two years, even if Comcast elects to remove some of its licenses from the
purchase agreement."
"The extension fee is fully creditable against the purchase price provided
DISH exercises its option to purchase the spectrum by this date."
"If DISH does not purchase the spectrum licenses, T‑Mobile US
is obligated to put the licenses up for sale at auction."
"Should bidding not reach the defined minimum purchase price of
USD 3.6 billion, T‑Mobile US would be released from its obligation to sell the licenses."

its mobile equipment on these cell towers and, to this end, leases back the required capacity from Crown Castle."

obligations, taking into account future salary increases."
"The rates were determined in line with the average weighted duration
of the respective obligation."
"The discount rate is determined based on the yields of high-quality corporate bonds with AA rating, mapped in a yield curve
showing the corresponding spot rates."

Global Pension Policy and description of the plans
Deutsche Telekom manages its pension commitments based on the Group-wide Global Pension Policy."
"It ensures on a
worldwide basis that Group minimum standards regarding the granting and management of company pension benefits are
complied with, plans are harmonized, and financial and other risks to the core business are avoided or reduced."
"In addition,
the policy provides guidelines for the implementation and management of pension commitments and defines requirements for
the launch, adjustment, and closure of corresponding plans."
"The regulations and provisions laid down in this Group policy take
into account the national differences in state pension and other commitments under labor, tax, and social law and the common
business practices in the area of pension commitments."
"Defined benefit plans based on final salaries in the Group have largely been replaced by plans with contribution-based
promises to minimize the risks involved."
"In addition, a corporate CTA (Deutsche Telekom Trust e.V.) is used in Germany for
additional funding of pension obligations."
"A CTA is a legally structured trust agreement to cover unfunded pension
commitments with plan assets, and to provide greater protection against insolvency for these assets."
"In Germany there are commitments for pension and disability benefits for a majority of employees as well as pension benefits
for their surviving dependents."
"As part of a reorganization of the company pension plan, a capital account plan was introduced
across Germany in 1997 for active employees."
"Furthermore, in subsequent years, commitments acquired through company
acquisitions were also transferred to the capital account plan scheme."
"The capital account plan is an employer-financed,
contribution-based benefit promise."
"The salary-linked contributions granted annually earn interest in advance for each year of
provision up to age 60, calculated using age-based factors, converting the contribution into a guaranteed insured amount."
"The
advance interest rate currently stands at 3.50 % p."
(target interest rate for the capital account plan).
The period for providing these contributions to the capital accounts plan is initially limited to ten future contribution years.
"The contribution period will be extended automatically every year by a further year, unless terminated."
"The insured amounts
accumulated over the period of active service are paid out if an insured event arises, primarily in the form of a lump sum."
"Hence
there is only a limited longevity risk for these commitments."
"Based on the payment guidelines and the structure of the capital
account plan, the employer can plan for this, and there is only a small risk inherent in the plan with regard to the volatility of
remuneration dynamics."
"In October 2020, Deutsche Telekom and the ver.di trade union had agreed to gradually restructure the collectively agreed
risk benefits (death in the active phase and/or disability) in the company pension scheme for employees covered and not
covered by collective agreements in Germany."
"Grandfather clauses have been included for employees who have worked for
the company for longer periods and part-time employees."
"As a result of the restructuring, risk benefit payments are directly
recognized as expenses in the payout year."
"In addition, in Germany there are various closed legacy commitments, which generally provide for old-age and disability
benefits as well as benefits for surviving dependents in the form of life-long pensions."
"The commitments predominantly
comprise the overall pension of the supplementary retirement pensions institution (Versorgungsanstalt der Deutschen
Bundespost – VAP) that takes into account the statutory pension."
"To the extent that defined benefit plans in Germany grant annuities, the future adjustment for these pensions, except for
insignificant exceptions, is bindingly defined in the existing benefit regulations."
"A change in the assumptions for the general
pension trend in Germany therefore only has an immaterial impact on the defined benefit obligations."
"To cover pension obligations over the long term, Deutsche Telekom has transferred funds to a corporate CTA and a corporate
pension fund."
"The main pension plans in the United States comprise medical plans, life insurance (for pensioners and active employees), and
pension commitments."
"The commitments have been entirely frozen and replaced by contribution plans (401(k) plans) within
the meaning of IAS 19 for future vested rights."
"The pension commitments in the United States mainly relate to two defined benefit plans: the Sprint Retirement Pension Plan
(SRPP) and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)."
"The benefit amount under the SRPP is calculated primarily
on the basis of 1.5 % of the beneficiary’s total salary up to December 31, 2005."
"Furthermore, the additional SERP was set
up for contributions above the tax exemption limits for the relevant eligible persons."
"Both plans have been frozen since
December 31, 2005, such that plan participants have not been able to earn any more vested rights since that date."

"229
The SRPP is financed through a pension fund within the framework of U.S."
"The level of financing of the SRPP
is regularly reviewed, with the company paying additional contributions into the pension fund on top of the minimum
contributions if necessary, depending on the financing status."
"Under the medical plans, the Company grants allowances for medical care after retirement to top up statutory benefits."
"In
addition to the existing pensioners, there is a small group of active employees who are near retirement, who can also access
benefits from these plans."
"Under the life insurance policies, the Company pays a benefit in the event of the death of a pensioner (basic coverage for
pensioners prior to 2004) of 50 % of the final allowable income drawn (taking into account a cap for the maximum amount
payable)."
"Under the company pension system in Switzerland, a defined benefit plan is in place that is financed by employer and
employee contributions (within the meaning of IAS 19)."
"This plan is granted by the legally independent T‑Systems pension
fund."
"As is often the case in Switzerland, the companies grant higher benefits than legally required."
"In
addition, the Swiss Federal Council defines a minimum interest rate for the obligatory retirement assets (2024: 1.25 %, 2023:
1.00 %)."
The foundation board (Stiftungsrat) presides over the Swiss pension fund.
"It ensures the day-to-day running of the pension fund
and decides on fundamental aspects, such as the amount and the structure of the pension benefits and the asset investment
strategy."
The foundation board is equally composed of employer and employees’ representatives.
"Due to the minimum yield for the obligatory retirement assets, a risk exists for the plans in Switzerland that additional
resources would have to be allocated to the pension fund if it were to be underfinanced."
"The pension fund offers the plan
members the option to choose a life-long pension instead of a one-time payment."
"This option gives rise to longevity and
investment risks, since at the time of retirement, assumptions must be made regarding life expectancy and return on assets."
"As of January 1, 2018, T‑Systems Schweiz decided to apply the risk-sharing method when measuring its pension obligations."
"The measurement of obligations was changed such that employee participation in funding a possible deficit can be taken
into account when measuring the employer’s obligation."
"The general option for employee participation in funding a deficit is
covered by Art."

"It essentially aims to establish a widely diversified investment portfolio that generates a risk profile appropriate to the overall
objective, by means of corresponding risk factors and diversification."
"The management of investments is subject to continuous

"Cost-efficient investment management is effected by means of professional

Other provisions for personnel costs increased by EUR 0.3 billion, mainly due to an increase in the carrying amount of the

"Other provisions for personnel costs also include provisions for deferred compensation and allowances, as well as
for anniversary gifts."

"These include the estimated costs for dismantling and
removing assets, and restoring the sites on which they are located."
"The estimated costs are included in the costs of the relevant

as provisions related to executory contracts, the disposal of businesses and site closures, in particular in prior financial years,
as well as warranty and environmental damage provisions."
"The other, non-staff-
related provisions are discounted using maturity-related discount rates specific to the respective currency area."

"In addition, they may be sold on the stock market or by way of an offer to all shareholders, or canceled."
"Under the resolution of the shareholders’ meeting on April 1, 2021, the Board of Management is also authorized to acquire the
shares through the use of equity derivatives."
No treasury shares were acquired in the reporting period and in the prior year.
"Currently, the treasury shares for participants
of the Share Matching Plan and of the Shares2You shares program for employees are issued from the pool of shares previously
held in a trust deposit."
"As part of the acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Corp., Bellevue, and Powertel, Inc., Bellevue, in 2001, Deutsche Telekom AG
issued new shares from authorized capital to a trustee, for the benefit of holders of warrants, options, and conversion rights,
among others."
These option or conversion rights expired in full in the 2013 financial year.
"As a result, the trustee no longer
had any obligation to fulfill any claims in accordance with the purpose of the deposit."
"The trust relationship was terminated
at the start of 2016 and the deposited shares were transferred free of charge to a custody account of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"On the basis of authorization by the shareholders’ meetings on May 25, 2016 and April 1, 2021, the treasury shares acquired
free of charge may be used for the same purposes as the treasury shares acquired for a consideration."
"In the reporting year,
5,972 thousand previously deposited shares were reallocated for issue to eligible participants of the Share Matching Plan (prior
year: 708 thousand shares)."
"For matching shares from the Share Matching Plan and for free shares from the Shares2You shares program for employees,
treasury shares are transferred free of charge to the custody accounts of employees of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"In cases where
treasury shares are transferred to the custody accounts of employees of other Group companies, the costs have been
transferred at fair value to the respective Group company since the 2016 financial year."
"For treasury shares bought by way
of the personal investment as part of the employee share program Shares2You and transferred to the custody accounts of
employees, a conversion rate of EUR 20.96 per share and EUR 20.24 per share was used on the respective dates."
"The conversion
is determined using the lowest price at which a trade actually took place on an official German exchange on the date of
conversion."
"In all months of the reporting year, except for December, treasury shares (5,914 thousand in total) were reallocated and
transferred to the custody accounts of eligible participants (prior year: 760 thousand treasury shares)."
"As of
December 31, 2023, disposals of treasury shares resulting from the transfers in the reporting period accounted for 0.12 %, or
EUR 15 million, of share capital."
Gains on disposal arising from transfers of treasury shares amounted to EUR 118 million.
"The
transfers of treasury shares increased the capital reserve by EUR 103 million."
"In the reporting year, 1,808 thousand treasury
shares with a fair value of EUR 37 million were billed to other Group companies."
Each share entitles the holder to one vote.

Changes in the composition of the Group, transactions with owners, and capital increase."
"Notes to the consolidated income statement
As a result of the sales agreement concluded on July 13, 2022, the GD tower companies had been recognized as a discontinued
operation from the third quarter of 2022 until their sale on February 1, 2023."
"Thus, the contributions by the GD tower companies
were no longer included in the individual items of the consolidated income statement."
"This income is primarily attributable to accrued interest on receivables in connection with handsets sold under installment plans in the
United States operating segment."
"The breakdown of revenues by revenue category was changed in line with the Group’s management model, effective
January 1, 2023."
Comparative figures have been adjusted retrospectively.
"For further information on this change, please refer to the section “Changes in accounting policies and changes in the reporting structure.”
The service revenues essentially comprise predictable and/or recurring revenues from Deutsche Telekom’s core activities."
"These relate to revenues that are generated from services (i.e., revenues from fixed and mobile network voice services,
incoming and outgoing calls, as well as data services) plus roaming revenues, monthly basic charges and visitor revenues, as
well as revenues from the ICT business."
"Service revenue also includes revenues earned in connection with premium services for
customers, such as reinsurance for device insurance policies and extended warranties."
"Revenue from insurance contracts in the
scope of IFRS 17 in the Group amounted to EUR 4.5 billion (2022: EUR 4.6 billion, 2021: EUR 2.7 billion)."
"Net revenue includes revenue from the use of entity assets by others in the scope of IFRS 16 in the amount of EUR 1.1 billion
(2022: EUR 2.2 billion, 2021: EUR 3.8 billion)."
"Of the revenue from the use of entity assets by others reported in net revenue,
EUR 0.7 billion (2022: EUR 0.8 billion, 2021: EUR 0.9 billion) relates to service revenues and EUR 0.4 billion (2022:
EUR 1.5 billion, 2021: EUR 2.9 billion) to non-service revenues."
"Net revenue for the reporting year was EUR 112.0 billion, down EUR 2.2 billion on the prior-year level."
"The United States
operating segment in particular contributed to the negative revenue trend, which was attributable to lower terminal equipment
revenue."
"First of all, the migration of former Sprint customers to the T‑Mobile US network is complete, such that fewer devices
compatible with the T‑Mobile US network were sold to these customers."
"Furthermore, customers use their devices longer."
"In
addition, T‑Mobile US continued its strategic withdrawal from the terminal equipment lease business."
"The decline in terminal
equipment revenues was only partially offset by an increase in service revenue."
"In the Group Development operating segment,
year-on-year revenue development was dominated by the loss of the value contributions of the sold T‑Mobile Netherlands
entity and the GD tower companies."
The other operating segments recorded positive revenue trends.
"In the Germany operating
segment, revenue increased, driven mainly by growth in service revenues in the fixed-network core business and in mobile
communications."
Another revenue driver was the partnership business.
"In the Europe operating segment, revenue growth was
primarily attributable to the increase in higher-margin service revenues in the mobile business."
"Contract customer additions
also had positive effects on terminal equipment revenues."
"Growth in the Road Charging, Digital, Advisory, and Cloud portfolio
areas drove revenue growth in the Systems Solutions operating segment."

The total transaction price attributable to performance obligations that have (partially) not been fulfilled (hereinafter:
outstanding transaction price) amounts to EUR 23.4 billion (2022: EUR 25.6 billion, 2021: EUR 20.0 billion)."
"The portion of the outstanding transaction price attributable to performance obligations that have not been fulfilled or not yet
completely fulfilled at the end of the reporting year is generally recognized as revenue over the remaining term of the service
contracts concluded."
"Since most service contracts – unless they can be canceled at any time – have a minimum contract term
of 24 months, an average remaining term of approximately 12 months can be assumed, provided the course of business in the
mass business remains virtually unchanged."
"The disclosures only refer to transactions within the scope of IFRS 15, i.e., they do
not include portions of the transaction price being allocated to performance obligations outside the scope of this standard,
e.g., leases."
"Individual subsidiaries deviate from this general approach
and have not made use of these practical expedients for groups of contracts with similar characteristics."
"After Viapass accepted the system on March 30, 2016, the set-up phase
was completed on March 31, 2016."
"The subsequent operation phase has a duration of 12 years, with the additional option
for Viapass to extend the term three times by 1 year."
"Satellic has no entitlement to the toll revenue collected but receives
contractually agreed fees for setting up and operating the system."
"Viapass is authorized to terminate the arrangement giving
notice of six months with payment of reasonable compensation."
"The agreement was classified as a service concession arrangement within the meaning of
IFRIC 12."
"Since the start of the operation phase on April 1, 2016, the separate fees for operation and maintenance services have
been recognized as revenue in the respective periods, which totaled EUR 94 million in the reporting year (2022: EUR 85 million,
2021: EUR 75 million)."
"Income from insurance compensation
partly relates to further refunds from insurance companies for expenses incurred in connection with the cyberattack on
T‑Mobile US in August 2021."
"Gains resulting from deconsolidations and from the sale of investments accounted for using the equity method
related to the sale of an equity investment by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners."
"Other operating income in the prior year also included a payment of EUR 0.2 billion in connection with the
settlement of a series of patent disputes between T‑Mobile US and a competitor as well as a large number of individual items
at marginal amounts."

Changes in inventories comprise both volume- and value-based increases and decreases in inventories of finished goods and

"23 Own capitalized costs
Own capitalized costs amounted to EUR 2.7 billion in the reporting year (2022: EUR 2.9 billion, 2021: EUR 2.8 billion) and mainly
relate to investments in network build-out and the development of platforms for cell sites."
"The average headcount outside of Germany also decreased by 2.4 %, mainly due to
the program to reduce the workforce in the United States, which was implemented in the third quarter of 2023."
"In Europe, we
continued to drive forward the socially responsible staff restructuring."
"The sale of T‑Mobile Netherlands as of March 31, 2022
also continued to have an impact."
Increased recruitment in the Systems Solutions operating segment had an offsetting effect.
"Personnel costs decreased by EUR 0.3 billion year-on-year to EUR 19.1 billion, mainly driven by the United States operating
segment, due to the lower headcount, offset by higher restructuring expenses and exchange rate effects."
"In the Germany
and Europe operating segments and in the Group Headquarters & Group Services segment, lower headcounts resulted in a
reduction in personnel costs."
"The agreed salary increases from the collective agreements concluded in 2022 and 2023 in

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and right-of-use assets
decreased by EUR 3.7 billion year-on-year to EUR 24.0 billion, with the decrease being mainly attributable to the United States
operating segment."
"Depreciation and amortization decreased by EUR 2.7 billion to EUR 23.8 billion, with the decrease being mainly attributable to
the United States operating segment."
"Depreciation and amortization at T‑Mobile US were lower due to the ongoing strategic
withdrawal from the terminal equipment lease business."
"Depreciation and amortization also decreased due to the complete
write-off of certain 4G network components, including assets affected by the decommissioning of the former Sprint’s legacy
CDMA and LTE networks in 2022."
"The decrease was offset by increased depreciation and amortization in connection with
the further build-out of the nationwide 5G network in the United States."
"In addition, a further reduction in the useful life of
leased network technology for cell sites following the business combination of T‑Mobile US and Sprint increased depreciation
of the corresponding right-of-use assets by EUR 0.2 billion."
"In the Germany operating segment, depreciation and amortization
increased, partly as a result of the sale and leaseback of passive network infrastructure in Germany and Austria in connection
with the sale of the GD tower companies and the associated recognition of retained right-of-use assets."
"The impairment losses recognized in the reporting year amounted to EUR 0.2 billion and largely related to the Systems
Solutions operating segment and the Group Headquarters & Group Services segment."
"These related to follow-up investments
in connection with assets previously impaired in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 financial years."
"Furthermore, despite the business
outlook remaining positive, the increase in the cost of capital in the reporting year prompted further impairment losses to be
recognized on non-current assets at the end of 2023."
"The impairment losses recorded in the prior-year period of EUR 1.2 billion
were mainly attributable to the former Sprint’s fiber-optic-based wireline assets in the United States operating segment
(EUR 0.9 billion)."
These impairment losses arose in part in connection with the sale of the business agreed in September 2022.
"Other impairment losses in the prior year related to the Systems Solutions operating segment and Group Headquarters & Group
Services segment (EUR 0.1 billion), and to the Europe operating segment (EUR 0.1 billion)."
"For information on the development of EBIT, please refer to the section “Development of business in the Group” in the combined management report."
Finance costs increased from EUR 5.3 billion to EUR 5.7 billion.
"By contrast,
interest income increased by EUR 0.5 billion, primarily due to an increase in cash on hand invested in interest-bearing money-
market investments, where the returns generated were higher than in 2022."
"In addition, interest income resulted from the
aforementioned premature repayment of bonds below face value, and from the reversal of related cash flow hedges on a pro
rata basis."
"Interest of EUR 207 million (2022: EUR 125 million, 2021: EUR 211 million) was capitalized as part of acquisition costs in the
reporting year."
"The amount was calculated on the basis of an interest rate in the average range between 3.4 % at the start
of the year and 4.2 % at the end of the year (2022: between 3.4 % and 3.4 %, 2021: between 3.6 % and 3.4 %) applied across

Interest payments (including capitalized interest) of EUR 7.9 billion (2022: EUR 6.9 billion, 2021: EUR 6.4 billion) were made in
the reporting year."
"Accrued interest payments from derivatives (interest rate swaps) that were designated as hedging instruments in a fair value
hedge in accordance with IFRS 9 are netted per swap contract and recognized as interest income or interest expense depending
on the net amount."
Finance costs are assigned to the measurement categories on the basis of the hedged item.
"Only financial
liabilities were hedged in the reporting period."
"The main factor in this was impairment
losses recognized in the reporting year of EUR 2.6 billion and EUR 0.1 billion, respectively, on the carrying amounts of the
investments in the GD tower companies and in GlasfaserPlus."
"These impairment losses were due entirely to higher discount
rates due to macroeconomic developments in the reporting year."
"By contrast, the business outlook for the GD tower companies
improved slightly."
"Level 3 input parameters were used to determine the pro rata recoverable amounts – as fair value less costs of disposal –
of EUR 3.4 billion for the GD tower companies and of EUR 0.3 billion for GlasfaserPlus (after deduction of net debt)."
"Discount
rates of 7.18 % for the GD tower companies and 5.70 % for GlasfaserPlus were used."
"The prior year included an interest rate-
based impairment loss of EUR 0.5 billion recognized on the carrying amount of the stake in GlasfaserPlus."
"In the prior year, the
recoverable amount was EUR 0.5 billion and the discount rate was 5.37 %."
"This decrease was mainly attributable to the
subsequent measurement using actuarial principles of the present value of the provision recognized for the Civil Service Health
Insurance Fund."
"In the prior year, the measurement was affected by the significant increase in the interest rate level in that
period."
Gains from financial instruments decreased by EUR 0.6 billion to EUR 0.2 billion.
"As a rule, all income/expense components including interest income and expense from financial instruments classified as at
fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 are reported under gains/losses from financial instruments."

Income taxes in the consolidated income statement
A tax expense of EUR 3.7 billion was recorded in the 2023 financial year."
"The amount of tax expense essentially reflects the
shares of the different countries in profit before income taxes and their respective national tax rates."
"However, the effective tax
rate was increased in particular by an impairment loss on the carrying amounts of the stake in the GD tower companies that had
no effect on tax."
"In the prior-year period, a tax expense of EUR 1.9 billion was recognized on the lower profit/loss before income
taxes, which also essentially reflected the respective national tax rates."
"However, the tax rate was reduced by the realization of
non-taxable income from the sale of T‑Mobile Netherlands and the shares in GlasfaserPlus."
"It consists of corporate
income tax at a rate of 15.0 %, the solidarity surcharge of 5.5 % on corporate income tax, and trade tax at an average multiplier
of 445 % (2022: 445 %, 2021: 445 %)."

"A positive tax effect in the amount of EUR 3 million (2022: EUR 3 million, 2021: EUR 3 million) attributable to the utilization of
tax loss carryforwards on which deferred tax assets had not yet been recognized was recorded in the reporting year."
The write-up of deferred tax assets resulted in a positive effect of EUR 24 million in the reporting year (2022: EUR 47 million).
"No deferred tax liabilities were recognized on temporary differences in connection with equity interests in subsidiaries
amounting to EUR 685 million (December 31, 2022: EUR 543 million) as it is unlikely that these differences will be recognized
in the near future."
"Deferred tax assets on temporary differences of EUR 170 million, attributable to accumulated allowances on equity
investments in the Europe operating segment, were recognized, of which EUR 130 million related to potential sales of equity

Deutsche Telekom will fall within the scope of the MinStG (German Minimum Tax Act) from the 2024 financial year, which is why

"Furthermore, Deutsche Telekom is making use of the
exemption provided in IAS 12.4A, under which no deferred taxes are to be recognized in connection with the global minimum
level of taxation."
"Owing to the complexity of the regulations and the fact that many states have yet to complete the legislative process, it is

For the 2023 financial year, the Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG proposes to the shareholders’ meeting a
dividend of EUR 0.77 for each no par value share carrying dividend rights."
"On the basis of this payout volume, total dividends in
the amount of EUR 3.8 billion would be appropriated to the no par value shares carrying dividend rights as of February 13, 2024."
"The final amount of the total dividend payment depends on the number of no par value shares carrying dividend rights as of

A dividend of EUR 0.70 for the 2022 financial year for each no par value share carrying dividend rights was paid out in 2023.
"Furthermore, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is determined by deducting the
weighted average number of treasury shares held by Deutsche Telekom AG."
There are currently no significant diluting effects.

Net cash from operating activities
Net cash from operating activities increased by EUR 1.5 billion year-on-year to EUR 37.3 billion."
"This positive trend is
attributable to sound business development."
"Lower cash outflows in connection with the integration of Sprint in the United
States also had a positive effect."
"However, net cash from operating activities was negatively impacted by the sale of T‑Mobile
Netherlands and the GD tower companies, as well as by exchange rate effects."
"The increase in tax payments of EUR 0.4 billion
and the increase in net interest payments of EUR 0.1 billion also had a reducing effect."
"Deutsche Telekom defines operating working capital as the total of trade receivables, inventories, and trade and other payables."
"The positive effect on the change in assets carried as operating working capital is mainly attributable to the strategic
withdrawal from the terminal equipment lease business in the United States operating segment and the associated decline
in receivables from terminal equipment leasing."
"Furthermore, there is a positive year-on-year effect from the completed
migration of former Sprint customers to the T‑Mobile US network, which meant there was a smaller increase in receivables
under the Equipment Installment Plan in the reporting year than in the prior year."
"Moreover, the prior year included a negative
effect from the increase in receivables as a result of the planned termination of factoring agreements in the Germany operating
segment."
"By contrast, there was a positive effect in the prior year from the greater reduction of stock levels of terminal
equipment in the United States operating segment, which was primarily driven by the impending market launch of new models
and the warehouse closures at former Sprint sites."
"The negative effect on the change in liabilities carried as operating working
capital mainly resulted from a lower procurement volume in the reporting year, especially in the United States operating
segment."
"b Includes, in addition to the cash inflow for the sale of the business operation of EUR 3,671 million, outflows of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of
EUR 29 million."
"c Includes, in addition to the cash inflow of EUR 441 million for the sale of the 50 % stake, outflows of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of
EUR 9 million."
"d Includes, in addition to the cash inflow of EUR 111 million in connection with the loss of control, outflows of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of

"e Includes, in addition to the cash inflow for the sale of the business operation of EUR 113 million (cash inflow of EUR 118 million less outflows of cash and
cash equivalents of EUR 5 million), the cash inflow from the sale-and-leaseback transaction of EUR 23 million."

EUR 89 million."
"g Includes, in addition to the cash inflow of EUR 56 million for the sale of the Wireline Business, outflows of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of
EUR 43 million."
"At EUR 17.9 billion, cash outflows for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were EUR 6.2 billion
lower than in the prior year."
"In the United States operating segment, mobile spectrum licenses were acquired for a total of
EUR 1.0 billion (of which EUR 0.1 billion for FCC licenses) and in the Europe operating segment, mobile spectrum licenses were
acquired for a total of EUR 0.3 billion in the reporting period."
"In the prior year, this item had included cash outflows for the
acquisition of mobile spectrum licenses of EUR 3.0 billion in the United States operating segment and of EUR 0.1 billion in the
Europe operating segment."
"Excluding investments in mobile spectrum licenses, cash outflows for investments in intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment were down EUR 4.4 billion year-on-year."
"Cash outflows in the United States operating
segment decreased by EUR 4.3 billion, in particular due to higher cash outflows for investments in the prior year as a result
of the accelerated build-out of the 5G network and the integration of Sprint."
"Cash outflows also decreased year-on-year as a
result of the sale of the business entities GD tower companies and T‑Mobile Netherlands."
"By contrast, cash outflows increased
by EUR 0.2 billion in the Germany operating segment, mainly in connection with the fiber-optic build-out."
"The contractually promised government grants from publicly funded projects for the broadband build-out in Germany were
recognized in full as receivables."
"They reduce the cost of the relevant property, plant and equipment."
"The grants received and
payments made for the build-out continue to be recognized in net cash used in/from investing activities; however, they are
not part of cash capex, because the payments made do not result in additions to property, plant and equipment."
"Since the
payments are not made at the same point in time as the proceeds are received, the net amounts can be positive or negative in
the individual periods."

the 2023 financial year."
"Capitalized interest of EUR 0.2 billion (2022: EUR 0.1 billion, 2021: EUR 0.2 billion) was reported within
cash capex in net cash used in/from investing activities, together with the associated assets."
"As a result, these assets are recognized in the statement of financial position under right-of-use assets and the
related liabilities under lease liabilities."
"Future repayments of the liabilities will be recognized in net cash used in/from financing
activities."
"In the prior-year period, EUR 6.6 billion had related to the modification of the arrangements with Crown Castle,
resulting in an increase in the same amount in the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities."
"Excluding
this effect, asset leases were up EUR 1.7 billion against the prior-year period, mainly due to the leaseback of passive network
infrastructure in Germany and Austria under the sale-and-leaseback agreement in connection with the sale of the GD tower
companies."
"In the United States operating segment, asset leases were down slightly year-on-year, mainly due to synergies from
the decommissioning of Sprint’s old mobile network and the associated lower lease liabilities for network technology."
"Consideration for the acquisition of broadcasting rights is paid by Deutsche Telekom in accordance with the terms of the
contract on the date of its conclusion or spread over the term of the contract."
"Financial liabilities of EUR 0.3 billion were
recognized in the 2023 financial year for future consideration for acquired broadcasting rights (2022: EUR 0.5 billion)."
"The
payment of the consideration will be recognized in net cash used in/from financing activities."
"In the United States operating segment, EUR 0.1 billion was recognized for mobile terminal equipment under property, plant
and equipment in the reporting period (prior-year period: EUR 0.3 billion)."
"This relates to the terminal equipment lease model
at T‑Mobile US, under which customers do not purchase the devices but lease them."
"The cash outflows are presented under
net cash from operating activities."
"The decline was primarily due to the strategic withdrawal from the terminal equipment lease
model."

The goal of the Group Development operating segment is to actively manage entities and equity investments to grow their
value."
"In this context, 51.0 % of the shares in the cell tower business companies in Germany and Austria (GD tower companies)
were sold on February 1, 2023."
"The investment management group Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners; Comfort Charge, which
is a provider of e-mobility charging infrastructure; and the Group functions of Mergers & Acquisitions and strategic Portfolio
Management are also assigned to Group Development."
"The Group Headquarters & Group Services segment comprises all Group units that cannot be allocated directly to one of the
operating segments, as well as the Board of Management department for Technology and Innovation."
"Group Headquarters
defines strategic aims for the Group, ensures they are met, and becomes directly involved in selected Group projects."
"Further units are Group Supply Services (GSUS) for real estate
management and strategic procurement, and MobilitySolutions, which is a full-service provider for fleet management and
mobility services."
"The consolidated
income statement was adjusted with retrospective effect in the comparative periods."

off, net segment liabilities totaling EUR 0.1 billion were transferred from the Systems Solutions operating segment to the Group

assets and liabilities that are carried in the financial statements prepared by the segments and included in the consolidated
financial statements."

these disclosures will not be made."
"Contingent liabilities
On the basis of the information and estimates available, the following issues do not fulfill the requirements for recognition as

"Proceedings
against
T‑Mobile US
in
consequence
of
the
cyberattack
on
T‑Mobile US
in
August
2021."
"In
August 2021, T‑Mobile US confirmed that their systems had been subject to a criminal cyberattack that compromised data
of millions of their customers, former customers, and prospective customers."
"With the assistance of outside cybersecurity
experts, T‑Mobile US located and closed the unauthorized access to their systems and identified customers whose information
was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements."
"As a result of the cyberattack, numerous
consumer class actions including mass arbitrations were filed against T‑Mobile US."
"The class actions brought before the federal
courts were consolidated into one action in December 2021."
"The plaintiffs are claiming damages in an as yet unspecified
amount."
"On July 22, 2022, T‑Mobile US entered into an agreement to settle the consumer class action in the Federal Court
for USD 350 million."
"In addition, T‑Mobile US had committed to spending a total of USD 150 million in 2022 and 2023 on data
security and related technologies."
The settlement was approved by the court in June 2023.
"A member of the class action
appealed against the final decision on approval and is objecting to the awarding of lawyers’ fees by the court to the lawyer
for the class action."
This is further delaying the closure of the proceedings.
"T‑Mobile US expects that the settlement of the
consumer class action, together with further settlements already or still to be concluded with consumers, will satisfy essentially
all claims asserted to date by current, former, and potential customers affected by the cyberattack in 2021."
"T‑Mobile US has
recognized corresponding provisions for risks in the statement of financial position of around USD 0.3 billion (EUR 0.3 billion)."
"Furthermore, in November 2021, a derivative action was brought against the members of the Board of Directors of T‑Mobile US
and against T‑Mobile US as nominal defendant."
This action has since been withdrawn.
"In September 2022, a further purported
shareholder filed a new derivative action against the members of the Board of Directors of T‑Mobile US and against T‑Mobile US
as nominal defendant alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duties relating to the company’s cybersecurity practices."
"It is
currently not possible to estimate the resultant financial risk with sufficient certainty."
"In addition, inquiries have been made by various government agencies, law enforcement and other state authorities, with which
T‑Mobile US is cooperating in full."
"It is currently not possible to estimate the resultant financial risk of these proceedings with
sufficient certainty."
Proceedings against T‑Mobile US in consequence of the cyberattack on T‑Mobile US in January 2023.
"On January 5, 2023,
T‑Mobile US identified that a bad actor was obtaining data through an application programming interface (API)."
"The results of the investigation indicate that, in total, around 37 million
current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts were affected, although many of these accounts did not include the full
data set."
"T‑Mobile US assumes that the attacker retrieved data via the affected API for the first time from or around
November 25, 2022."
"In accordance with federal and state requirements, the company has notified those individuals whose data
was affected."
"In connection with this cyberattack, consumer class actions were filed against T‑Mobile US and official inquiries
were submitted to the company, to which it will respond and, as a result of which, it may incur substantial expenses."
"It is
currently not possible to estimate the resultant financial risk with sufficient certainty."
"Like many other large telecommunications and internet providers, Deutsche Telekom is exposed to a
growing number of intellectual property rights disputes."
"There is a risk that Deutsche Telekom may have to pay license fees

of a product or the use of a technology."
"Deutsche Telekom and its subsidiaries are subject to proceedings under anti-trust law in various
jurisdictions, which may also lead to civil follow-on claims."
"Taken individually, none of the proceedings has a material impact."

grounds of alleged collusion in violation of anti-trust law and breach of contract."
"Deutsche Telekom AG, which at that time
held 50 % of the mobile company EE Limited, has rejected the claims as unsubstantiated."
"The High Court of Justice in London
heard testimony from several witnesses and experts in the period between mid-May and the end of July 2022 with a view to
establishing the legal basis for a claim."
"On November 10, 2023, the High Court of Justice in London rejected all claims made by
Phones4U against all defendants."
"In December 2023, Phones4U filed an application for leave to lodge an appeal with the High

"40 Lessor relationships
Finance leases."
Deutsche Telekom is a lessor in connection with finance leases.
"Essentially, these relate to the leasing of routers
and other hardware, which Deutsche Telekom provides to its customers for data and telephone network solutions."
"The following table shows how the amount of the net investment in a finance lease is determined:
millions of €
Dec."
"260
The following table presents the gross investment amounts and the present value of payable lease payments:
millions of €
Dec."
Deutsche Telekom is a lessor in connection with operating leases.
"The underlying leases mainly relate to
mobile terminal equipment in the United States operating segment, cell sites, building and co-location space, and unbundled
local loop lines."
"By contrast, contracts on the provision of the latest generation of modems/routers to consumers in the fixed-
network mass-market do not satisfy the definition of a lease, where modem and router features are incorporated in one device."
"Where terminal equipment is leased in the United States operating segment, customers are entitled to receive a new device
once per month during the term of the lease."
"On receipt of the new device or at the end of the contract, the customer either
returns or purchases the equipment."
"The purchase price at the end of the lease is set at the commencement of the lease and is
equal to the estimated residual value of the equipment."
"The purchase price is based on the type of equipment and the advance
payment."
"The contracts do not contain any residual value guarantees or variable lease payments, nor do they contain any
restrictions or covenants."
"Terminal equipment returned by customers is prepared for sale in the secondary market or for use as
a replacement for defective devices."
This reduces the residual value risk of the returned equipment.
"The leasing of local loop lines and space to wholesale fixed-network customers (e.g., co-location space) is also classified
as a lease."
"The regulator requires Deutsche Telekom to make co-location space and unbundled local loop lines available to
competitors."
"In contrast to unregulated products, the residual value risk for these assets is rather low because competitors are
economically dependent on the use of these assets."
"In the unlikely event that co-location space and unbundled local loop lines
are not leased, Deutsche Telekom will try to find new tenants for the vacant space or unleased lines."
"In the case of its own cell
sites in the Europe operating segment, Deutsche Telekom will also strive to continue leasing – where possible – all of the free
space that it does not itself occupy."
"The aim here is to reduce the vacancy rate of unused space as far as possible by re-letting
and to spread the cost."

The reduction in lease payments of EUR 2.0 billion is mainly the result of the sale of a 51 % stake in the cell tower business

"Of the EUR 2.5 billion
of lease payments, as of December 31, 2022, EUR 1.9 billion related to DFMG Deutsche Funkturm GmbH, which was part of the
GD tower companies held for sale."
This entity leased cell sites to third parties.
"Under this
scheme, customers of Deutsche Telekom buy insurance coverage for accidental damage, loss and theft."
"An insurance company
is insurer, and Deutsche Telekom is the insurance company’s reinsurer, covering all losses."
"The coverage period of each contract
in the group is one month."
Deutsche Telekom applies the premium allocation approach in accordance with IFRS 17.
"It can be
reasonably expected that the premium allocation approach results in a measurement of the liability for remaining coverage for
the group that does not differ materially from the one that would be produced applying the general measurement requirements
in IFRS 17."
Insurance revenue for the period is the amount of expected premium receipts allocated to the period.
"The level
of insurance risk is rather constant throughout the coverage period."
"There has not been significant variability in the level of
claims over the past years."
"The premium receipts are therefore allocated to each period on the basis of the passage of time in
accordance with IFRS 17, and the amount of the risk adjustment is primarily based on past experience."
"For materiality reasons,
no adjustments are made for the time value of money and the effect of financial risk."
"Amounts receivable from or payable to
the insurance company are presented as other financial assets or financial liabilities respectively to the extent the offsetting
criteria are not met."
Incurred claims of uncertain timing or amount are presented as other provisions.
"The portfolio of insurance
contracts is composed of a multitude of customers."
There are no significant risk concentrations.
"The main risk arising from the
portfolio is the level of claims."
The amounts are illustrated in the table below.

"Of the equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and recognized under other financial
assets, the instruments presented in the different levels constitute separate classes of financial instruments."
"In each case, the
fair values of the total volume of equity instruments recognized as Level 1 are the price quotations at the reporting date."
"The listed bonds and other securitized liabilities are assigned to Level 1 or Level 2 depending on the market liquidity of the
relevant instrument."
"Consequently, issues denominated in euros or U.S."
"dollars with relatively large nominal amounts are to
be classified as Level 1, the rest as Level 2."
"The fair values of the instruments assigned to Level 1 equal the nominal amounts
multiplied by the price quotations at the reporting date."
"The fair values of the instruments assigned to Level 2 are calculated
as the present values of the payments associated with the debts, based on the applicable yield curve and Deutsche Telekom’s
credit spread curve for specific currencies."

The fair values of liabilities to banks and other interest-bearing liabilities are calculated as the present values of the payments

currencies."
"The fair values of trade receivables and of originated loans and other receivables are calculated as the present
values of the payments associated with the receivables, based on the applicable yield curve and the credit risk of the debtors."
"Since there are no market prices available for the derivative financial instruments in the portfolio assigned to Level 2 due to
the fact that they are not listed on the market, the fair values are calculated using standard financial valuation models, based
entirely on observable inputs."
"The fair value of derivatives is the price that Deutsche Telekom would receive or have to pay if the
financial instrument were transferred at the reporting date."
"Interest rates of contractual partners relevant as of the reporting
date are used in this respect."
The middle rates applicable as of the reporting date are used as exchange rates.
"In the case of
interest-bearing derivatives, a distinction is made between the clean price and the dirty price."
"In contrast to the clean price, the
dirty price also includes the interest accrued."
The fair values carried correspond to the full fair value or the dirty price.
"The equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise a large number of investments
in strategic, unlisted individual positions."
"Deutsche Telekom considers the chosen measurement through other comprehensive
income without recycling to profit or loss to be appropriate because there are no plans to use the investments for short-term
profit-taking."

The equity instruments assigned to Level 3 that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and carried
under other financial assets are equity investments with a carrying amount of EUR 411 million measured using the best
information available at the reporting date."
"As a rule, Deutsche Telekom considers transactions involving shares in those
companies to have the greatest relevance."
Transactions involving shares in comparable companies are also considered.
"The
proximity of the relevant transaction to the reporting date, and the question of whether it was conducted at arm’s length, are
relevant for deciding which information is used for the measurement."
"Furthermore, the degree of similarity between the object
being measured and comparable companies must be taken into consideration."
"Based on Deutsche Telekom’s own assessment,
the fair values of the equity investments at the reporting date could be determined with sufficient reliability."
"At the reporting
date, no investments were held for sale."
"In the case of investments with a carrying amount of EUR 41 million, an analysis of operational indicators (especially revenue,
EBIT, and liquidity) revealed that the carrying amounts were equivalent to current fair values."
"Due to better comparability,
previous arm’s length transactions involving shares in these companies are preferable to more recent transactions involving
shares in similar companies."
"Here, multiples to
the reference variable of expected revenue (ranging between 3.4 and 29.0) were applied and a range of equally distributed
percentiles in intervals of 16.7 % around the median were taken as a basis."
"For each investment, the appropriate percentile was
used depending on the specific circumstances."
"If other values had been used for the multiples and for the expected revenue
amounts, the calculated fair values would have been different."
"These hypothetical deviations (sensitivities) are shown in the
table below."
"In addition, non-material individual items with a carrying amount of EUR 52 million when translated into euros are
included with differences in value of minor relevance."
"For the development of the carrying amounts in the reporting year, please refer to the table above."
"The derivatives without a hedging relationship assigned to Level 3 and carried under derivative financial assets relate to
options embedded in bonds issued by T‑Mobile US with a carrying amount of EUR 200 million when translated into euros."
"The options, which can be exercised by T‑Mobile US at any time, allow early redemption of the bonds at fixed exercise prices."
"Observable market prices are available regularly and also at the reporting date for the bonds as entire instruments, but not
for the options embedded therein."
The termination rights are measured using an option pricing model.
"Historical interest rate
volatilities of bonds issued by T‑Mobile US and comparable issuers are used for the measurement because these provide a
more reliable estimate at the reporting date than current market interest rate volatilities."
"The spread curve, which is also
unobservable, was derived on the basis of current market prices of bonds issued by T‑Mobile US and debt instruments of
comparable issuers."
Risk-free interest rates and spreads were simulated separately from each other.
"In our opinion, the values used constitute the best estimate
in each case."
"If other values had been used for interest rate volatility, spread curve, or mean reversion, the calculated fair values
would have been different."
These hypothetical deviations (sensitivities) are shown in the table below.
"If the risk-free interest
rate had been 50 basis points higher (lower) at the reporting date, the fair value of the options would have been EUR 63 million
lower (EUR 82 million higher)."
"In the reporting period, net income of EUR 66 million when translated into euros was recognized
under the Level 3 measurement in other financial income/expense for unrealized gains for the options in the portfolio at the
reporting date."
"In the reporting period, no option was exercised."
"Please refer to the table above for the development of the
carrying amounts in the reporting period."
"The changes in value recognized in profit or loss in the reporting period were mainly
attributable to fluctuations in the interest rates and historical interest rate volatilities in absolute terms that are relevant for
measurement."

b Interest rate volatility shows the magnitude of fluctuations in interest rates over time (relative change).
"The larger the fluctuations, the higher the interest rate volatility."
"c The spread curve shows, for the respective maturities, the difference between the interest rates payable by the debtor and the risk-free interest rates."
"A minimum of zero was set for the
spread curve for the sensitivity calculation, i.e., negative spreads are not applicable."
"d Mean reversion describes the assumption that, after a change, an interest rate will revert to its average over time."
"The higher the selected value (mean reversion speed), the faster the
interest rate will revert to its average in the measurement model."
e Renewable energy credits is the term used for U.S.
"With a carrying amount of EUR 169 million when translated into euros, the derivatives without a hedging relationship assigned
to Level 3 and carried under derivative financial assets relate to energy forward agreements embedded in contracts entered
into by T‑Mobile US."
"The same applies to derivative financial liabilities with a carrying amount of EUR 32 million when
translated into euros."
"These agreements consist of two components: the energy forward agreement and the acquisition
of renewable energy credits by T‑Mobile US."
"In the case of one energy forward agreement, commercial operation is set
to begin in 2025; with the others, it has already begun."
"The energy forward agreements are measured using valuation models because no observable market
prices are available."
"The value of the derivatives is significantly influenced by the future energy output, the future energy
prices on the relevant markets, and the future prices of renewable energy credits."
"The main contract parameters, including
the assumptions made for unobservable parameters and periods, are set out in the following table."
"In our opinion, these
assumptions made constitute the best estimate in each case."
"In the view of T‑Mobile US, the contracts were entered into
at current market conditions, and the most appropriate parameters for the unobservable inputs were used for measurement
purposes."
The transaction price at inception was zero in each case.
"Instead, these day 1 gains are amortized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of commercial
energy production."
"This amortization adjusts the effects from measuring the derivatives in each accounting period using the
respective valuation models and updated parameters."
"All amounts from the measurement of the derivatives are presented in
net terms per contract in the statement of financial position (derivative financial assets/liabilities) and in the income statement
(other operating income/expenses)."
Sprint also has agreements of this kind in its portfolio.
"These were concluded before the
business combination with T‑Mobile US and, for these agreements too, unobservable inputs have a material influence on the
measurement of the derivatives."
"However, under the requirements for business combinations, the respective amounts resulting
from the measurement are recognized as derivative financial assets, as a result of which there are no amounts yet to be
amortized for these agreements."

"At the reporting date,
the calculated fair value from Deutsche Telekom’s perspective for one of the energy forward agreements described above is
negative and amounts to EUR ‑10 million when translated into euros."
"All the rest are positive and amount to EUR 264 million

"If other values had been used for future energy prices, future energy output, or future prices of
renewable energy credits, the calculated fair values would have been different."
"These hypothetical deviations (sensitivities)
are shown in the table above."
"In the reporting period, net income of EUR 24 million when translated into euros was recognized
under the Level 3 measurement in other operating income/expense for unrealized gains for the derivatives for all the above
energy forward agreements."
"Please refer to the corresponding table for the development of the carrying amounts in the
reporting period."
"The market-price changes in the reporting period were attributable in part to changes in observable and
unobservable energy prices and to interest rate effects."
"On the other hand, contract adjustments gave rise to income of
EUR 33 million."
"The development of the day 1 gain yet to be amortized in the income statement in the reporting period is shown
in the following table."
"The straight-line amortization of the day 1 gains through profit or loss over the period of commercial
energy production amounts to a total of EUR 11 million per year when translated into euros."
"In addition, similar energy forward
agreements were concluded in Europe for which, however, no significant volatility in fair value is to be expected."
"At the
reporting date, their carrying amount when translated into euros was EUR 53 million (liability), and they were designated as
hedging instruments in hedge relationships."

The spread of the debtor IFM constitutes an unobservable input.
"At the current
reporting date, values of between 1.2 % and 1.4 % were used for the discounting of the individual payments."
"In our opinion,

changes in the interest rates that are relevant for measurement and to the fact that, based on the current build-out plans,
payments are expected up to two years later than originally planned."
"Due to its distinctiveness, this instrument constitutes a
separate class of financial instruments."
"The other financial assets assigned to Level 3 (originated loans and other receivables)
with a carrying amount of EUR 11 million relate to immaterial items for which no significant volatility in fair value is to be
expected."
"For the trade receivables, originated loans, and other receivables assigned to Level 3, which are measured either at fair value
through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss, the main factor in determining fair value is the
credit risk of the relevant counterparties."
"If the default rates applied as of the reporting date had been 1 % higher (lower)
with no change in the reference variables, the fair values of the instruments would have been 1 % lower (higher)."
"As a rule, a credit scoring model is used for receivables

"A weighted average credit-risk spread of 6.49 % (December 31, 2022: 6.28 %)

Principles of risk management
Deutsche Telekom is exposed in particular to risks from changes in exchange rates, interest rates, and market prices that affect
its assets, liabilities, and forecast transactions."
"Financial risk management aims to limit these market risks through ongoing
operational and finance activities."
"Selected derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments are used for this purpose,
depending on the risk assessment."
"However, Deutsche Telekom only hedges the risks that affect the Group’s cash flows."
"Derivatives are exclusively used as hedging instruments, i.e., not for trading or other speculative purposes."
"To reduce the
credit risk, hedging instruments are generally only concluded with leading financial institutions whose credit rating is at least
BBB+/Baa1."
"In addition, the credit risk for derivatives with a positive market value is generally minimized through collateral
agreements with all core banks."
"Furthermore, the limits for deposits are also set and monitored on a daily basis depending on
the rating, share price performance, and credit default swap level of the respective counterparty."
"The fundamentals of Deutsche Telekom’s financial policy are established by the Board of Management and overseen by the
Supervisory Board."
Group Treasury is responsible for implementing the financial policy and for ongoing risk management.
"Certain transactions require the prior approval of the Board of Management, which is also regularly briefed on the severity and
amount of the current risk exposure."
Group Treasury regards effective management of the market risk as one of its main tasks.
"The main risks relate to foreign
currencies and interest rates."
"Deutsche Telekom is exposed to currency risks from its investing, financing, and operating activities, and from
dividend payments received."
Risks from foreign currencies are hedged to the extent that they influence the Group’s cash flows.
"Foreign-currency risks that do not influence the Group’s cash flows (i.e., the risks resulting from the translation of assets and
liabilities of foreign operations into the Group’s reporting currency) are generally not hedged, however."
"Deutsche Telekom may
nevertheless also hedge this foreign-currency risk under certain circumstances."
"Foreign-currency risks in the area of investment result, for example, from the acquisition and disposal of investments in foreign
companies."
Deutsche Telekom hedges these risks.
"If the risk position exceeds EUR 100 million, the Board of Management must
make a special decision on how the risk shall be hedged."
"If the risk position is below EUR 100 million, Group Treasury performs
the currency hedging itself."
"At the reporting date, Deutsche Telekom was not exposed to any significant risks from foreign-
currency transactions in the field of investments."
"Foreign-currency risks in the financing area are caused by financial liabilities in foreign currency and loans in foreign currency
that are issued to Group entities for financing purposes."
Group Treasury hedges these risks.
"Cross-currency swaps and currency
derivatives are used to convert financial obligations and intragroup loans denominated in foreign currencies into the Group
entities’ functional currencies."
"At the reporting date, the foreign-currency liabilities for which currency risks were hedged mainly consisted of bonds in U.S."
dollars and pounds sterling.
"On account of these hedging activities, Deutsche Telekom was not exposed to any significant
currency risks in the area of financing at the reporting date."
Foreign-currency risks from dividend payments mainly result from the shares Deutsche Telekom holds in T‑Mobile US.
T‑Mobile US has paid dividends in U.S.
dollars as part of its shareholder return program since December 2023.
"Deutsche Telekom hedges potential volatility resulting from the dividends expected in euros on a rolling basis for a period of
up to four years."
"As such, Deutsche Telekom was not exposed to any foreign-currency risks from dividend payments at the
reporting date."
The Group entities predominantly execute their operating activities in their respective functional currencies.
"Payments made
in a currency other than the respective functional currency result in foreign-currency risks in the Group."
"Deutsche Telekom generally uses currency derivatives for hedging
purposes."
"On account of these hedging activities, Deutsche Telekom was not exposed to any significant short-term exchange
rate risks from its operating activities at the reporting date."

For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of
relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity."
"In addition to currency risks, Deutsche Telekom is exposed to
interest rate risks and price risks in its investments."
"The periodic effects are determined by relating the hypothetical changes in
the risk variables to the balance of financial instruments at the reporting date."
"It is assumed that the balance at the reporting
date is representative for the year as a whole."
"Relevant risk variables are generally all non-functional
currencies in which Deutsche Telekom has contracted financial instruments."
"Exchange rate fluctuations therefore have no effects on profit or loss, or shareholders’
equity."
Equity instruments held are of a non-monetary nature and therefore are not exposed to a currency risk as defined by IFRS 7.
"Interest income and interest expense from financial instruments are also either recorded directly in the functional currency or
transferred to the functional currency using derivatives."
"For this reason, there can be no effects on the variables considered in
this connection."
"In the case of fair value hedges designated to hedge currency risks, the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the
hedging instrument attributable to changes in exchange rates balance out almost completely in the income statement in the
same period."
"As a consequence, these financial instruments are not exposed to currency risks with an effect on profit or loss, or
shareholders’ equity, either."
"Cross-currency swaps are always assigned to non-derivative hedged items, so these instruments likewise do not have any
currency effects."
Deutsche Telekom is therefore only exposed to currency risks from specific currency derivatives.
"Some of these are currency
derivatives that are part of an effective cash flow hedge for hedging payment variability resulting from changes in exchange
rates in accordance with IFRS 9."
"Volatility of exchange rates of the currencies on which these transactions are based affects the
hedging reserves in shareholders’ equity and the fair value of these hedging instruments."
"Others are currency derivatives that
are neither part of one of the hedges defined in IFRS 9 nor part of a natural hedge."
"These derivatives are used to hedge planned
transactions."
"Changes in exchange rates of the currencies on which such financial instruments are based affect other financial
income or expense (net gain/loss from remeasurement of financial assets and liabilities to fair value)."
"If the euro had gained (lost) 10 % against all currencies at December 31, 2023, the hedging reserves in shareholders’ equity and
the fair values of the hedging instruments before taxes would have been EUR 173 million higher (lower) (December 31, 2022:
EUR 11 million higher (lower))."
"The hypothetical effect of EUR 173 million on profit or loss primarily results from the currency
sensitivities EUR/USD: EUR 176 million, EUR/GBP: EUR ‑5 million, and EUR/CHF: EUR 2 million."
"If the euro had gained (lost)
10 % against all currencies at December 31, 2023, other financial income/expense and the fair value of the hedging instruments
before taxes would have been EUR 41 million higher (lower) (December 31, 2022: EUR 54 million lower (higher))."
"The
hypothetical effect on profit or loss of EUR 41 million primarily results from the currency sensitivities EUR/USD:
EUR -36 million, EUR/GBP: EUR 29 million, EUR/PLN: EUR 27 million, and EUR/HUF: EUR 18 million."
"Deutsche Telekom is exposed to interest rate risks, mainly in the euro zone and in the United States."
The interest rate risks are actively managed as part of the interest rate management activities.
"For the debt position in
euros a maximum variable percentage is set on an annual basis, taking into account the planned finance costs."
"The debt
position of T‑Mobile US in U.S."
"dollars is primarily determined through partially cancelable, fixed-income debt instruments."
"The
composition of the liabilities portfolio (ratio of fixed to variable) is managed by issuing non-derivative financial instruments and,
where necessary, also deploying derivative financial instruments."
"Including derivative hedging instruments, an average of 15 % (2022: 44 %) of the debt position denominated in euros had a
variable rate of interest in 2023."
"dollars, the variable percentage – compared to 2022 – remained at 0 %."
Interest rate risks are presented by way of sensitivity analyses in accordance with IFRS 7.
"These show the effects of changes
in market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expense, other income components, and, if appropriate,
shareholders’ equity."
"The interest rate sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions: Changes in the market
interest rates of non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rates only affect income if these are measured at their
fair value."
"As such, all financial instruments with fixed interest rates that are carried at amortized cost are not subject to interest
rate risk as defined in IFRS 7."

In the case of fair value hedges designated for hedging interest rate risks, the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and
the hedging instrument attributable to changes in interest rates balance out almost completely in the income statement in the
same period."
"This means that interest-rate-based changes in the measurement of the hedged item and the hedging instrument
largely do not affect income and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk."
"Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of non-derivative variable-interest financial instruments,
the interest payments of which are not designated as hedged items of cash flow hedges against interest rate risks."
"As a
consequence, they are included in the calculation of income-related sensitivities."
"In addition, changes in the market interest rate had an impact on the carrying amount of trade receivables recognized at fair
value and originated loans and other receivables."
"However, this variability is not managed."
"Currency derivatives are not exposed to interest rate risks and
therefore do not affect the interest rate sensitivities."
"If the market interest rates had been 100 basis points higher at December 31, 2023, profit or loss before taxes would have
been EUR 19 million (December 31, 2022: EUR 270 million lower) higher."
"If the market interest rates had been 100 basis points
lower at December 31, 2023, profit or loss before taxes would have been EUR 24 million (December 31, 2022: EUR 271 million
higher) lower."
"The hypothetical effect of EUR 19 million/EUR -24 million on profit or loss primarily results from potential effects
of EUR 26 million/EUR -26 million from interest rate derivatives."
"Potential effects from interest rate derivatives are partially
balanced out by the contrasting performance of non-derivative financial instruments, which cannot, however, be shown due
to applicable accounting standards."
"The effects from the options embedded in the bonds issued by T‑Mobile US are not
included in this simulation."
"If the market interest rates had been 100 basis
points higher (lower) at December 31, 2023, the hedging and revaluation reserves in equity before taxes would have been
EUR 922 million higher (EUR 922 million lower) (December 31, 2022: EUR 538 million higher (EUR 540 million lower))."
"Despite
the unusually strong movement in interest rates in the 2023 reporting year, a sensitivity of 100 basis points is still appropriate,
since Deutsche Telekom considers this high volatility to be an exception."
"As part of the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 also requires disclosures on how hypothetical changes in
risk variables affect the price of financial instruments."
Important risk variables are stock exchange prices or indexes.
"If the share price of T‑Mobile US had been 10 % higher (lower) at December 31, 2023, the fair value of options held for
the purchase of shares in T‑Mobile US would have been EUR 102 million higher (EUR 100 million lower) (December 31, 2022:
EUR 346 higher (EUR 342 million lower))."
"In addition, aside from the value-creating factors in the financial instruments assigned
to Level 3 described above, there were no other price risks at the reporting date."
Deutsche Telekom is exposed to a credit risk from its operating activities and certain financing activities.
"As a rule, transactions
with regard to financing activities are only concluded with counterparties that have at least a credit rating of BBB+/Baa1, in
connection with active limit management."
"In addition, we have concluded collateral agreements for our derivative transactions."
"At the level of operations, the outstanding debts are continuously monitored in each area, i.e., locally."
"Credit risks are taken into
account through allowances calculated at portfolio level."
"The solvency of the business with corporate customers, especially
international carriers, is monitored separately."
"In terms of the overall risk exposure from the credit risk, however, the receivables
from these counterparties are not so extensive as to justify extraordinary concentrations of risk."

In line with the contractual provisions, in the event of insolvency all derivatives with a positive or negative fair value that exist
with the respective counterparty are offset against each other, leaving a net receivable or liability."
"The net amounts are normally
recalculated every bank working day and offset against each other."
"When the netting of the positive and negative fair values of all derivatives was negative from Deutsche Telekom’s perspective,
Deutsche Telekom provided cash collateral to counterparties pursuant to collateral agreements."
"The net amounts are normally
recalculated every bank working day and offset against each other."
"The cash collateral paid is offset by corresponding negative
net derivative positions of EUR 1,513 million at the reporting date, which is why it was not exposed to any credit risks in this
amount at the reporting date."
"For further information, please refer to Note 11 “Other financial assets.”
The collateral paid is reported under originated loans and other receivables within other financial assets."
"On account of its
close connection to the corresponding derivatives, the collateral paid constitutes a separate class of financial assets."
"Likewise,
the collateral received, which is reported as other interest-bearing liabilities under financial liabilities, constitutes a separate
class of financial liabilities on account of its close connection to the corresponding derivatives."
"There were no other significant
agreements reducing the maximum exposure to the credit risk of financial assets."
"The maximum exposure to the credit risk of
the other financial assets thus corresponds to their carrying amounts."
"In accordance with the terms of the bonds issued by T‑Mobile US, T‑Mobile US has the right to terminate the majority of bonds
prematurely under specific conditions."
"The rights of early termination constitute embedded derivatives and are presented

"Since they are not exposed to any
credit risk, they constitute a separate class of financial instruments."
"Please refer to the explanations above for more information

There is also no credit risk on embedded derivatives held.
"No collateral is provided for the options received from third parties for the purchase or sale of shares in subsidiaries and

Hedge accounting
Fair value hedges."
"To hedge the fair value risk of fixed-income liabilities, Deutsche Telekom primarily uses interest rate swaps
and forward interest rate swaps (pay variable, receive fixed) denominated in EUR and USD."
"Fixed-income bonds denominated
in EUR and USD were designated as hedged items."
"The changes in the fair values of the hedged items resulting from changes
in the EURIBOR or USD SOFR swap rate are offset against the changes in the value of these interest rate swaps."
"In addition,
cross-currency swaps mainly in the EUR/USD and EUR/GBP currency pairs, are designated as fair value hedges, which convert
fixed-income foreign currency bonds into variable-interest EUR bonds to hedge the interest rate and currency risk."
"The changes
in the fair value of the hedged items resulting from changes in the USD SOFR and GBP SONIA swap rate as well as the USD and
GBP exchange rate, are offset against the changes in the value of the cross-currency swaps."
"The aim of the fair value hedges is
thus to transform the fixed-income bonds into variable-interest debt, thus hedging the fair value (interest rate risk and currency
risk) of these financial liabilities."
"Credit risks are not part of the hedging and, on account of Deutsche Telekom’s rating, have
only an immaterial effect on the changes in the fair value of the hedged item."
Cash flow hedges – interest rate risks.
"Deutsche Telekom mainly uses payer interest rate swaps and forward-payer interest
rate swaps (pay fixed, receive variable) to hedge the cash flow risk of existing and future debt."
"The interest payments to be
made in the hedging period are the hedged items and are recognized in profit or loss in the same period."
"Hedged items may be
individual liabilities, portfolios of liabilities, or combinations of liabilities and derivatives (aggregate risk exposure)."
"The changes
in the cash flows of the hedged items resulting from changes in the USD SOFR rate and the EURIBOR rate are offset against
the changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swaps."
"The aim of this hedging is to transform the variable-interest bonds
into fixed-income debt, thus hedging the cash flows of the financial liabilities."
"Credit risks are not part of the hedging and, on
account of Deutsche Telekom’s rating, have only an immaterial effect on the changes in the fair value of the hedged item."
Cash flow hedges – currency risks.
"Deutsche Telekom entered into currency derivative and cross-currency swaps (pay fixed,
receive variable) to hedge cash flows not denominated in a functional currency."
"The payments in foreign currency to be made
in the hedging period are the hedged items and are recognized in profit or loss in the same period."
"The terms of the hedging
relationships will end in the years 2024 through 2033."
"In the case of rolling cash flow hedges for hedging currency risks, short-
term currency forwards are entered into, which are then extended by means of follow-up transactions."

Hedging of a net investment.
To hedge the net investment in T‑Mobile US against fluctuations in the U.S.
"dollar spot rate, a
net investment hedge of a nominal USD 2 billion was designated in the reporting period."
"Short-term currency forwards are

dollars – receive euros”) with a change in the U.S.
"dollar spot rate being designated as
the hedged risk."
Any changes in value of the hedged net investment resulting from changes in the U.S.

rate are offset by changes in the value of the currency forwards."
"Hedging of the net investment in T‑Mobile US is planned to
be continued until 2027."
"To this end, short-term follow-up transactions are to be concluded when the hedging instruments
expire."
"At each reporting date, effectiveness is reviewed prospectively based on the key characteristics and is determined
retrospectively in the form of a dollar offset test."
"The net investment hedge was sufficiently effective as of the reporting
date."
The hedges of the net investment in T‑Mobile US against fluctuations in the U.S.

The recorded ineffectiveness in the consolidated income statement mainly results from the different discount rates of the
hedged items (fixed-income) and designated hedging instruments (fixed-income and variable-interest)."
"Furthermore, cross-
currency interest rate hedges are impacted by effects from cross-currency basis spreads, which are included in the hedging
instruments, but not in the hedged items."
"For some hedges, the characteristics of hedging instruments and hedged items differ,
resulting in ineffectiveness."
"In the case of interest rate hedges on highly probable future borrowings, ineffectiveness could
arise if time shifts occur."
The relative amounts of the ineffectiveness are not expected to increase significantly in the future.
"Furthermore, there are no other potential sources of ineffectiveness."
b The hedging costs relate entirely to cross-currency basis spreads.
"In two transactions, subsidiaries of Deutsche Telekom sell receivables to structured entities that are
also subsidiaries of Deutsche Telekom and were established for the sole purpose of these factoring agreements."
"The required
funding is provided to these structured entities in the context of Deutsche Telekom’s general Group financing."
"These structured
entities have no assets and liabilities other than those resulting from the purchase and sale of the receivables under factoring
agreements."
"The structured entities transfer the legal role of creditor for the receivables in each case to a bank that performs
this role on behalf of the respective investors who have beneficial ownership of the receivables (administrative agent)."
"For
both agreements, these investors are eleven banks and seven other structured entities altogether."
"Deutsche Telekom does
not consolidate these seven other structured entities because it has no control over their relevant activities."
"The seven other
structured entities are financed through the issue of commercial paper to third parties outside the Group or, alternatively,
through a credit facility provided in each case by a bank."
"The receivables being sold are selected from the relevant portfolios,
either in an automated process in compliance with the eligibility criteria set out in the receivables purchase agreement or based
on the decision of the relevant structured entity taking an obligatory minimum volume into account."
"Receivables are sold on a
daily basis and billed on a monthly basis."
"The purchase price up to a specific amount will be paid out immediately upon sale;
remaining portions of the purchase price will only be paid to the extent that the volume of receivables sold in the relevant
portfolio decreases further accordingly or the characteristics of the receivables change."
"In the transactions, Deutsche Telekom
is obligated to buy back aged receivables and receivables for which a write-off is imminent at nominal value."
"Such buy-backs do
not affect the allocation of the credit risk-related losses in any way, as the latter would be passed back to the buyers in line with
the agreed risk allocation."
The cash flows resulting from the buy-backs normally occur in the month following the buy-back.
None of the structured entities has business activities other than the purchase or sale of trade receivables or other investments.
"In none of the transactions is Deutsche Telekom exposed to risks other than the credit risk and late-payment risk resulting from
the sold receivables agreed in the respective agreement."
"The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the sold
receivables are based on the credit risk and the late-payment risk."
"Deutsche Telekom bears certain portions of the credit risk
in the individual transactions."
The other credit risk-related losses are borne by the respective buyers.
"The late-payment risk in
all transactions continues to be borne in full by Deutsche Telekom."
"Substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
receivables were neither transferred nor retained (allocation of the material risks and rewards between Deutsche Telekom and
the buyers)."
Deutsche Telekom continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold.
"The buyers have the right to transfer the
servicing to third parties for no specific reason."
"Although Deutsche Telekom is not authorized to use the receivables sold other
than in its capacity as servicer, it retains control over the receivables sold because the buyers and the structured entities do not
have the practical ability to resell the purchased receivables."
"At the time the receivables are sold, the fair value of the expected
losses is expensed."
Expected future payments are presented as a component of the associated liability.
"Certain portions of the
purchase price are initially held back and, depending on the amount of the actual defaults, are only paid to Deutsche Telekom at
a later date."
"To the extent that such portions of the purchase price are expected to be received in the future, they are recognized
at fair value."

payment is made by the customer)."
"The carrying amount of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the extent to which
the actual losses to be borne by Deutsche Telekom resulting from the credit risk and the late-payment risk exceed the losses
initially expected."
This amount is recognized as an expense.
"Please refer to the table below for the disclosures on the continuing
involvement resulting from the receivables sold."
Providers of debt capital expect an appropriate return and that Deutsche Telekom is able to repay its debts.

Share Matching Plan
Members of the Board of Management have a contractual obligation to invest one third of the Short-Term Incentive (STI) set by
the Supervisory Board in shares of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"There is an option to voluntarily increase the investment volume to
up to 50 % of the STI."
"Deutsche Telekom AG will transfer one additional share for every share acquired as part of this Board of
Management member’s aforementioned personal investment (Share Matching Plan – SMP) on expiration of the four-year lock-
up period starting from the date of purchase."
The functioning of STI and SMP is set out in the following chart.
"Target achievement is generally
determined based on the collective targets set for the respective organizational unit."
"Deutsche Telekom AG will award one
additional share for every share acquired as part of this executive’s aforementioned personal investment (Share Matching Plan)."
These shares will be allotted to the beneficiaries of this plan on expiration of the four-year lock-up period.
"Other executives in specific management groups who were not contractually obligated to participate in the Share Matching
Plan are given the opportunity to participate on a voluntary basis."
"This offer is only made when the Group’s free cash flow
target for the preceding year has been achieved."
"To participate, the executives invest between a minimum of 10 % and a
maximum of 50 % of the target amount (100 %) of the short-term variable remuneration component (Short-Term Incentive) in
shares of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"Deutsche Telekom AG will award one additional share for every two shares acquired as part
of this executive’s aforementioned personal investment (Share Matching Plan)."
"The additional shares will be allotted to the
beneficiaries of this plan on expiration of the four-year lock-up period."

The individual Share Matching Plans are each recognized for the first time at fair value on the grant date."
"To determine
the fair value, the expected dividend entitlements are deducted from Deutsche Telekom AG’s share price, as there are no
dividend entitlements until the matching shares have been allocated."
"In the 2023 financial year, a total of 0.9 million (2022:
0.9 million) matching shares were allocated to beneficiaries of the plan at a weighted average fair value of EUR 17.75 (2022:
EUR 15.37)."
"The cost is to be recognized against the capital reserves pro rata temporis until the end of the service period
and amounted to EUR 11 million in total for all tranches as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: EUR 11 million)."
"In the
reporting year, shares with a total value of EUR 8 million (2022: EUR 8 million) were transferred to plan participants."
"The capital
reserves recognized for the Share Matching Plan as of December 31, 2023 amounted to EUR 29 million (December 31, 2022:
EUR 26 million)."
"Long-Term Incentive Plan
Since the introduction of the new Board of Management remuneration system in 2021, Board of Management members also
participate in the Group’s existing Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI)."
"The amount of the annual participation is contractually
defined individually for each Board of Management member."
"Executives from the Deutsche Telekom AG Group also participate in the LTI provided they meet certain eligibility requirements
or have an individual contractual commitment."
"For executives who are offered the option of voluntary participation in the
SMP, investment in the SMP is a necessary condition for participation in the LTI."
"The value of the phantom shares received lies between 15 % and 43 % of the
participant’s annual target salary."
The initial number of phantom shares is contingent on the share price in a reference period at the inception of the plan.
"Over the term of the four-year plan, the value of the phantom shares changes in line with Deutsche Telekom AG’s share price
development."
"The number of phantom shares will change in line with the achievement of the targets for four equally weighted
key performance indicators (return on capital employed, adjusted earnings per share, employee satisfaction, and customer
satisfaction), to be determined at the end of each plan year."
"In addition, a dividend is granted for the phantom shares over the
term of the plan."
"This dividend is reinvested in phantom shares, increasing the number of phantom shares held by each plan
participant."
"At the end of the four-year plan term, the final number of phantom shares will be converted on the basis of a share
price calculated in a reference period at the end of the plan and paid out in cash together with the dividend for the last year of
the plan, which is not converted into phantom shares."
The individual LTIs are each recognized for the first time at fair value on the grant date.
"The fair value of a plan is calculated
by multiplying the number of phantom shares by Deutsche Telekom AG’s share price at the measurement date discounted
to the reporting date."
"For members of the Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG, the fair value is calculated on the
grant date taking into account a discount for a maximum payment amount of 200 %."
"This maximum payment amount does
generally not apply for other executives."
"In the 2023 financial year, a total of 3.84 million (2022: 4.87 million) phantom shares
were granted at a weighted average fair value of EUR 18.92 (2022: EUR 16.12)."
"A plan must be remeasured at every reporting
date until the end of the service period and expensed pro rata temporis."
"The cost of the LTI plans amounted to EUR 140 million
for all tranches in the reporting year (2022: EUR 128 million)."
"In 2023, the provision was utilized in the amount of EUR 90 million
(2022: EUR 59 million)."
"In addition, the carrying amount increased by EUR 4 million as a result of discounting."
"The provision
amounted to EUR 302 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: EUR 248 million)."

"Each participating employee receives one additional free share in Deutsche Telekom AG
for every two shares acquired by way of this personal investment (Shares2You)."
"The shares acquired by the participants,
including the free shares, are subject to a four-year lock-up period and are blocked during this time, for example with regard to
sale."
The program is not subject to any minimum service period or performance conditions.
The cost for the free shares must be recognized against the capital reserves at the inception of the plan.
"In the 2023 financial
year, a total of 0.9 million free shares were granted to plan participants."
"A corresponding expense of EUR 18.2 million was
recognized as of December 31, 2023."
"In total, 2.5 million shares at a fair value of EUR 20.96 for the 2022 tranche and 2.7 million
shares at a fair value of EUR 20.24 for the 2023 tranche were transferred to plan participants in the 2023 financial year."
"Stock-based compensation at T‑Mobile US
In June 2023, the shareholders of T‑Mobile US approved the “2023 Incentive Award Plan,” which replaces the Omnibus
Incentive Plan from 2013."
"Under T‑Mobile US’ 2023 Incentive Award Plan, up to 33 million T‑Mobile US shares are authorized for
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance awards to employees, consultants, and
non-employee directors."
"As of December 31, 2023, there were around 33 million T‑Mobile US shares available for future grants
under this incentive plan."
"T‑Mobile US grants RSUs to eligible employees and certain non-employee directors, and performance-based restricted stock
units (PRSUs) to eligible key executives of the company."
"RSUs entitle the grantee to receive shares of T‑Mobile US’ common
stock at the end of a vesting period of up to three years."
"PRSUs entitle the holder to receive shares of T‑Mobile’ US common
stock at the end of a vesting period of up to three years if a specific performance goal is achieved."
"The number of shares
ultimately received is dependent on the actual performance of T‑Mobile US measured against a defined performance target."
"These PRSUs
are also included under PRSUs vested in 2023 and as such are a component of the item “Vested.”

"In addition, we have not audited the
unaudited content of the disclosures extraneous to combined management reports specified in section “Introductory remarks”
in the combined management report."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,
Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance
with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and
in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance
with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards
are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the
Combined Management Report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance with
the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f)
of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the
EU Audit Regulation."

our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report."

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023."
"These matters were addressed in
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not

In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit:
1."
"Revenue recognition
a) Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn/Germany, recognises revenue of bEUR 112.0 (prior year: bEUR 114.2) in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss for the financial year 2023."
"This revenue is particularly generated with the rendering of services,
i.e."
"rendering mobile and fixed-network voice and data services and ICT services as well as with the sale of goods and
merchandise."
"In view of the dynamic development of these complex services, the recognition of revenue with the necessary IT systems was
of particular significance in the scope of our audit."
"b) In order to assess risks of material misstatement, we first obtained an understanding of the process flows and the internal
controls related to the recognition of revenue by taking into account the corporate environment and the applicable accounting
standards."
"To the extent that identified controls were relevant to our audit of revenue, we tested the controls for design and
implementation."
"This testing of design and implementation covered both manual controls and automated controls in the
IT systems used for the purposes of revenue recognition (system-integrated input, processing and output controls for
transaction processing)."
"In the IT systems that are important to the implementation of controls, we also tested the general
IT controls – particularly those that secure authorised access, ensure system operation and changes in relation to these
IT systems – for design and implementation by calling in IT specialists."
"On the basis of the risks of material misstatement identified in the scope of these audit procedures, we selected manual
and automated controls as well as related general IT controls from the controls relevant to the audit with respect to revenue
recognition."
"Subsequently, these controls were tested for operating effectiveness to assess their effectiveness in the reporting
year."
"In this context, too, we involved IT specialists."
"We tested the reconciliation of transaction data recorded in the upstream systems to the revenue reported in the general
ledger for accuracy and completeness."
"This also included the examination of manual adjustment postings for revenue cut-
off."
"To further audit revenue, we used data analysis tools to generate evaluations of different revenue flows over time and
analysed deviations from expected customer and revenue trends."
"We examined the customer and contract data used in the
analyses by comparing the related contracts with the corresponding data in the master data systems on a sample basis."

"In the light of
the current geopolitical uncertainty, this initially relates to the economic development."
"In addition, the estimate of the trend
of the inflation rates (especially given the currently rising energy, investment and personnel costs) and the significantly higher
interest rate level have an impact on measurement."
"In particular, the following items recognised in the consolidated financial statements of Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn/Germany,
are affected:
Goodwill is tested for impairment once a year and, if necessary, on the occasion of events that cause an impairment in
accordance with IAS 36."
"Investments accounted for using the equity method – in particular the investments in GD Towers
Holding GmbH, Münster/Germany, (GD Towers) and Glasfaser Plus GmbH, Cologne/Germany, (GlasfaserPlus) – are tested
for any impairment on the occasion of events that cause an impairment."
"For this purpose, future cash flows are estimated
at the cash-generating unit level and discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of the company (WACC) at the
date of measurement."
"The future cash flows are derived from the current medium-term plans adopted by the executive
directors, which are based on assumptions made by the executive directors on the future market and corporate development."
"The economic development especially influences revenue and cash inflows, whereas the assumed inflation rate results in an
increase in expenses and cash outflows in particular."
"Furthermore, the increase in the general interest rate level affects the
weighted average cost of capital of the cash-generating unit."
"Because of the foregoing and the complex underlying
measurement models, the effects of the development of the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment on the
aforementioned balance sheet items are of particular significance in the scope of our audit."
"b) At the beginning and during our audit, we assessed to what extent the measurement processes were influenced by
subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors."
"With regard to the forecast of future cash flows within the scope of the impairment tests, we first assessed the reliability of
the planning by examining the past adherence to the budget process."
"Subsequently, we documented the underlying planning
process and critically assessed it."
"In addition, we evaluated selected planning assumptions based on general and industry-
specific market expectations for plausibility."
"In this context, we particularly looked at the consideration of possible impacts
of external effects on the economic development."
"In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses."
"Finally, we compared the
projected cash flows in the measurement models with the medium-term planning of the Company approved by the executive
directors."
"In the audit of the WACC as part of the impairment tests and the discount rates used to measure pension provisions and lease
liabilities, we examined the overall appropriateness of the interest rates used and obtained an understanding of the related
calculation scheme."
"In addition, we prepared bandwidths for selected discount interest rates and examined whether the actual discount rates used
are within these ranges."
