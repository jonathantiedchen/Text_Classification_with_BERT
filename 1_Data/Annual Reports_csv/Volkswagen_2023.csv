Growth that enhances value for years to come: that is the Volkswagen Group's objective."
"For our investors, for our 
customers, for our employees and for society as a whole."
"Amidst a demanding environment, we delivered robust results in fiscal year 2023."
"We increased deliveries to 
customers by 12% to 9.24 million vehicles, with all regions contributing to this growth."
"In China, the Group’s largest 
single market, we expanded by 1.6% despite a very challenging market environment."
"At the same time, the 
Volkswagen Group successfully continued its transformation, delivering 771,100 all-electric vehicles, up 34.7% 
compared with the previous year."
"In Europe, we further consolidated our strong market position in this segment."
Our robust financial performance reflects our customers' satisfaction in our products.
"With sales revenue of 
€322.3 billion, an operating result of €22.6 billion and a resulting operating return on sales of 7%, we have 
demonstrated the resilience of our business model."
"These results were achieved despite substantial headwinds 
from the measurement of commodity derivatives, which had had a beneficial effect on the operating result in the 
previous year."
"Another successful outcome of our endeavors was that we generated convincing net cash flow in 
the Automotive Division on the back of earnings of €10.7 billion."
"What’s more, the Automotive Division’s net 
liquidity of €40.3 billion at the end of 2023 puts us in a very solid position."
The Volkswagen Group delivers.
"And it does so reliably, even in a market environment charac-
terized by uncertainty."
"We are proud of our strong performance, and it is important to us that our shareholders also 
participate in this result."
"The Board of Management and Supervisory Board therefore propose a dividend of €9.00 
per ordinary share and €9.06 per preferred share."
Our focus is on electrification.
"At the same time, we are seeing that the ramp-up of e-mobility in some regions, 
such as North America and Europe, is progressing at a slower rate than previously assumed."
"Other countries, such 
as China, continue to impress with the speed of their transformation."
"This is why the Volkswagen Group is pursuing 
powertrain flexibility and financial robustness."
Our unique portfolio provides the right products for customers.
"While we are investing extensively in the ramp-up of e-mobility, we continue to offer highly competitive, efficient 
and attractive combustion-engine models."
"By including both these models and our hybrid and electric vehicles in 
our portfolio, we ensure maximum flexibility without losing sight of our goal – the transition to e-mobility is our 
priority."

Letter to our Shareholders
The Top 10 program again guided the success of our operational and strategic actions in the past year."
"We set 
priorities, and in doing so follow a clear and transparent logic: specific milestones, clear responsibilities and 
regular progress reviews."
One of the key points of the program is to align our company with the capital market.
The development of virtual equity stories for all Volkswagen Group brands was an important element in this pursuit.
"To us, investors are more than an important source of impetus: as shareholders, they are part of our company."
"Generating added value for them, together with all other stakeholders, is a key component of how we see our 
corporate governance role."
"This was one of the motivations for the Group Board of Management to seek intensive 
dialog with the capital market; as part of personal discussions at investor conferences in the world’s most impor-
tant financial centers or at our Capital Markets Day held at the Hockenheimring in June 2023."
2023 was a year of realignment and restructuring for the Volkswagen Group.
"In many areas, we made faster prog-
ress than originally planned and expected."
"A lot of streamlining has been completed, and we are forging ahead 
with other tasks."
We are transforming ourselves.
"The ground has been prepared: we are turning from renovator to 
architect and builder all in one."
"We have a plan and a clear view of the strengths and potential of the Volkswagen 
Group."
We know where we are heading.
Our focus is on implementation.
"We are moving ahead, 
step by step and day by day, making visible, measurable progress."
The Group’s strength lies in the strength of its brands.
"No other company offers such a compelling, strong and 
unique product portfolio."
We cater to our customers' wishes in all segments and across all vehicle categories.
"We 
set high standards for the quality and design of our vehicles."
"In the past, we did not always meet these standards 
– our own and those of our customers – to the fullest extent."
"Last year, we established ambitious quality and design 
programs across all brands, drawing on synergies and lessons learned from all players in the Volkswagen Group
team."
Initial results have shown that we are on the right track.
2024 will be a record year for new models.
"The
launch of our first vehicles on the all-electric premium PPE platform, the Audi Q6 e-tron and the Porsche Macan,
is an important milestone."
"They mark the establishment of a new generation of powerful, attractive models."
"We have lived up to our responsibility in the interest of generations, for generations."
"Our brands and our products 
must be viable for the future."
"To achieve this, we have to make a strong investment in the future."
"We have to be in 
a position to finance this goal, which is why we have agreed clear targets with all brands and launched effective 
performance programs."
"These programs are not just to make cost savings: they are a unique opportunity to shape 
things."
"We want to prepare the brands for future success, which includes new sources of revenue."
"It’s about 
sustainably increasing our profitability."
"Living up to our responsibility also means that we think of sustainability holistically, mindful of the natural environ-
ment, people, society and value-creating entrepreneurship."
"We have launched ambitious, structured programs in 
the Volkswagen Group and in all the brands."
"Meeting the targets set in these programs is the personal respon-
sibility of the managers."
An important element of our sustainability strategy is our commitment to decarbonization.
"Production is one of the key levers in this regard: by 2030, we aim to cut production-related CO2 emissions from 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 50% compared with the base year 2018."
"The prestigious Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has confirmed that, by setting this target for the production phase (Scope 1 and 
Scope 2), our company will meet the requirements for contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius."
"The target to reduce CO2 emissions during the use phase (Scope 3) by 30% has been confirmed by the SBTi as 
compliant with limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius."
These confirmations are an incentive for us.

Letter to our Shareholders
The Volkswagen Group team stands for a new leadership mindset."
"Together, we have committed ourselves to a 
clear stance: one of entrepreneurship and individual responsibility, a winning stance."
"Volkswagen – our joint enter-
prise."
And it is for us to solve them.
"In 2023, we homed in on one of our key skills, technology leadership, which is an integral part of Volkswagen’s 
DNA."
The customers of our strong and captivating brands benefit from an intelligent platform strategy.
"This is also 
the key to creating greater efficiency, using synergies and building economic resilience in challenging and fiercely 
competitive times."
"In this process, we think from the customer’s perspective and are able to offer attractive vehi-
cles with attractive solutions at an attractive price."
"With the realignment of our architectures, the establishment 
of technology profiles, progress in implementing the battery strategy and the expansion of high-performance 
charging networks, we have already achieved important milestones."
"The realignment of our software activities 
also is a powerful lever in the revision of our technology strategy."
"We focus on our core competencies, and also 
collaborate with a strong network of high-performing partners."
The Volkswagen Group thinks global and acts local.
"We want to remain strong in Europe and China and take 
advantage of our growth opportunities in North America."
"We do so with products tailored to the various require-
ments of our customers in different regions."
"Our strategy for the largest single market is entitled “In China for 
China”, and our actions have reflected the meaning of these words."
"In Hefei, we established Volkswagen China 
Technology Company last year."
"Today, more than 2,000 technology experts are already working here on the future 
of Chinese automaking."
"We aim to cut the development time for new products and technology by around 30% 
compared to the status quo to be in line with “China speed”."
"We are also making our product substance in China 
more Chinese."
"Our cooperations with strong partners such as XPeng, Thundersoft and Horizon Robotics are 
helping to make this possible: we will continue to work on the development of vehicles that are fully aligned with 
the needs of Chinese customers."
"In the North America region, we have taken significant steps forward by making 
fundamental strategy decisions such as on increasingly localized production, the construction of a battery cell 
plant in Ontario, Canada, and the revival and electrification of the traditional Scout brand."
"Here we will make 
increased use of product synergies to leverage our growth potential with local production."
"Beyond the markets in 
China, North America and Europe, we also apply regional strategies in the growth markets of South America and India."
"We established a new steering model in 2023, which signifies less head office and more entrepreneurial respon-
sibility and greater creative freedom for the brands and their decision makers."
"We pursue intelligent capital allo-
cation and set clear guidelines."
"Growth that enhances value for years to come, with our transformation, ladies and gentlemen, we are making 
systematic progress toward realizing this objective."
"After a year of reorganizing and streamlining our 
structures and focusing on the fundamental alignment of the Volkswagen Group, we are heading into a year of 
stabilizing and shaping our business."
"We are working toward the vision of a sustainably profitable 
group."
"A group with the most attractive products, the best team and the clear promise: sustainable mobility for 
generations to come."
"Sincerely, 
Oliver Blume

Report of the Supervisory Board
AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
In line with our proposal, the Annual General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on May 10, 2023 elected EY GmbH & 
Co."
KG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (EY) as auditors and Group auditors for fiscal year 2023.
"The auditors 
confirmed the annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG, the consolidated financial statements of the 
Volkswagen Group and the combined management report by issuing unqualified audit reports in each case."
"The 
Audit Committee had also agreed with the auditor that the auditor would inform the Audit Committee if, while 
conducting the audit, matters were identified that constituted an inaccuracy in the Declaration on the Code sub-
mitted by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board."
"The auditor did not inform the Audit Committee of 
any such matters."
"The Supervisory Board also commissioned EY to conduct an external audit of the content of the combined 
separate nonfinancial report for 2023."
"The 
auditors reported extensively at both meetings on the material findings of their audit and were available to 
provide additional information."
"The Chair of the Audit Committee was also in close contact with the auditors, 
including between the meetings and during the preparation of the Audit Committee meetings, about the prog-
ress of the audit, and reported to the Audit Committee on this."
"The Audit Committee and the auditor also consult 
regularly without the Board of Management."
"Following this, the Audit Committee recommended 
that the Supervisory Board approve the annual and consolidated financial statements."
"We examined the docu-
ments in depth in the knowledge and on the basis of the report by the Audit Committee and the audit report, as 
well as in talks and discussions with the auditors."
"The annual financial statements 
are thus adopted."
"Upon completion of our examination of the dependent company report, there are no objections 
to be raised to the concluding declaration by the Board of Management in the dependent company report."
"We 
reviewed the proposal on the appropriation of net profit submitted by the Board of Management, taking into 
account in particular the interests of the Company and its shareholders, and endorsed the proposal."
"EY con-
ducted an external limited assurance review of the content of the combined separate nonfinancial report for 
2023 and issued an unqualified report."
"At our meeting on March 1, 2024, EY also took part in the discussions on 
the agenda items relating to the combined separate nonfinancial report for 2023."
"Upon completion of its own 
independent examination of the combined separate nonfinancial report for 2023, the Supervisory Board did not 
have any objections."
"We also resolved that, together with the Board of Management, we would prepare the 
remuneration report for fiscal year 2023."
"The Executive Committee prepared the resolution of the Supervisory 
Board concerning the preparation of the remuneration report."
"As well as reviewing whether the remuneration 
report contained all the disclosures required by law, EY went beyond statutory requirements to audit its content 
and issued an unqualified report."
"We would like to offer our warm thanks and particular appreciation to the Board of Management, the Works 
Council, the management teams and all the employees of Volkswagen AG and its affiliated companies for their 
work in the reporting year."
"2023 was another year full of challenges to overcome, some of which were sub-
stantial."
"With hard work and a high level of personal commitment, they all contributed significantly to making 
2023 a positive fiscal year for the Volkswagen Group."

areas."

> b) Recommendation B.5 (Age limit for members of the Board of Management) 
Pursuant to Recommendation B.5, an age limit is to be specified for members of the Board of Management and 
disclosed in the Corporate Governance Declaration."
This has been complied with.
"In September 2023, the 
Supervisory Board re-appointed Dr Manfred Döss and in so doing exceeded the stipulated age limit by way of 
exception."
The Supervisory Board considered this exception to be in the interest of the company.
"The trans-
formation of the VOLKSWAGEN Group affects a large number of topics being addressed by the Integrity and 
Legal Affairs division for which Dr Döss is responsible, for example with regard to autonomous vehicles and 
ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues."
"Dr Döss has already positioned the VOLKSWAGEN Group 
well in this respect."
"The renewed appointment of Dr Döss ensures that the Group will continue to tread this 
path as effectively and efficiently as possible."
"The Supervisory Board otherwise adheres to the age limit 
specified for members of the Board of Management."
"It cannot, however, be ruled out that legal commentators 
would regard a company as having deviated from Recommendation B.5 even if it had exceeded a specific 
applicable age limit only once while the age limit as such remained in force."
"As a precautionary measure, such 
deviation is therefore being declared."
"> c) Recommendation C.5 (Mandate ceiling regarding Board of Management mandate) 
The Chair of the Supervisory Board is on the supervisory boards of three listed companies of the VOLKS-
WAGEN Group, namely VOLKSWAGEN AG (as Chair), Dr. Ing."
"Porsche AG and TRATON SE (as Chair), as 
well as being on the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE & Co."
"He is also Chair of the Board of Man-
agement of Porsche Automobil Holding SE."
"Porsche Automobil Holding SE is not part of the same group as 
VOLKSWAGEN AG, Dr. Ing."
"Porsche AG and TRATON SE within the meaning of German stock corporation 
law."
"We are, however, confident that the Chair of the Supervisory Board of VOLKSWAGEN AG has sufficient 
time at his disposal to fulfill the duties related to his mandates."
"> d) Recommendation C.13 (Disclosure regarding election proposals) 
Under this recommendation, certain circumstances shall be disclosed when the Supervisory Board makes 
election proposals to the General Meeting, but the requirements are vague and the definitions unclear."
"Purely 
as a precautionary measure, we therefore declare a deviation in this respect."
"Notwithstanding this, the Super-
visory Board will make every effort to satisfy the requirements of the recommendation."
"> e) Recommendation G.6 (Predominance of long-term variable remuneration) 
On 20 July 2022, Dr Ing."
"Porsche AG (Porsche AG) agreed upon a so-called IPO bonus with Dr Oliver 
Blume in the event of the successful IPO of Porsche AG."
"Since an IPO of this nature is also in the interest of 
VOLKSWAGEN AG, we are, as a precaution, treating the IPO bonus agreed upon with Porsche AG as part of 
Mr Blume’s remuneration at VOLKSWAGEN AG (third-party remuneration arrangement)."
"The Supervisory Board 
of VOLKSWAGEN AG approved the third-party remuneration arrangement for Dr Blume."
"The IPO bonus was 
awarded in the form of virtual shares."
"These virtual shares are converted into monetary sums in three tranches 
over periods of one, two, and three years depending on the development of the share price of Porsche AG 
shares during the relevant time period, and these monetary sums are then paid out to Dr Blume."
"As a pre-
caution, the Supervisory Board assumes that the first one and two-year tranches of the IPO bonus will be 
allocated to the short-term variable remuneration of Dr Blume, whilst the last, three-year tranche of the IPO 
bonus will be allocated to the long-term variable remuneration."
"This means that the total target value of the 
short-term variable remuneration approved for Dr Blume for fiscal year 2022 exceeded the target value of the 
long-term variable remuneration."
"In the current fiscal year 2023, the IPO bonus granted in fiscal year 2022 had 
still not been fully settled."
"As a precautionary measure, we are therefore continuing to declare a deviation from 
Recommendation G.6 in this respect."
"Nevertheless, the Board of Management remuneration for Dr Blume on 
the whole continues to be oriented towards the company’s sustainable and long-term development."
"> f) Recommendation G.10 sentence 2 (Four-year commitment period) 
Dr Blume can have access to the third tranche of the IPO bonus previously described under e) as part of the 
long-term variable remuneration after three years rather than after four."
"According to the agreement reached with Dr Diess, his contract shall continue to 
run until the end of its regular term, i.e."
"until the close of 24 October 2025, even following the premature 
termination of his appointment, provided that Dr Diess does not resign at an earlier date."
"Dr Diess shall accord-
ingly not receive a severance payment but shall potentially receive his contractual remuneration for a period of 
more than two years following his departure from the Board of Management."
"It is not clear to us whether this 
recommendation refers only to severance payments or also to payments to a retired member of the Board of 
Management due to a continuing contract of service."
"As a precautionary measure, we are therefore continuing 
to declare a deviation from Recommendation G.13 sentence 1 in this respect.” 
The current declaration of conformity and previous declarations of conformity are also published on our website 
shown hereafter."

Board functions."
"These comprise the Group Sales, Group Production, Group Procurement and Group Research 
and Development functions."

month."
Meetings of the Board of Management are convened by the Chair of the Board of Management.
"The Chair 
is required to convene a meeting if requested by any member of the Board of Management."
"The Chair of the

"The Board of Man-
agement takes decisions after prior debate or – if no other Board of Management member objects – using the 
written circulation procedure."
Resolutions of the Board of Management are adopted by a majority vote.
"In the 
event of a tie, the Chair of the Board of Management casts the deciding vote."
"The Board of Management is 
quorate if at least half of the members of the Board of Management participate in passing the resolution."
"Absent 
members of the Board of Management may participate in passing the resolution orally, in writing or via cus-
tomary communications media (e.g."
"Each Board of Management member manages their area of responsibility independently, without prejudice to 
the collective responsibility of the Board of Management."
"All Board of Management members must inform each 
other of events within their remit."
"All members of the Board of Management must immediately disclose conflicts of interest to the Chairman of 
the Supervisory Board and the Chair of the Board of Management and inform the other members of the Board of 
Management accordingly."
The Volkswagen Group companies are managed solely by their respective managements.
"The management 
of each individual company takes into account not only the interest of its own company but also the interests of 
the Group, the relevant brand group and the individual brands in accordance with the framework laid down by law."
"Board of Management committees 
Board of Management committees exist at Group level on the following areas: products, technologies, invest-
ments, digital transformation, integrity and compliance, risk management, human resources and management 
issues."
"Alongside the responsible members of the Board of Management, the relevant central departments and 
the relevant functions of the divisions are represented on the committees."
"Cooperation with the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG advises and monitors the Board of Management with regard to the 
management of the Company."
"Through the requirement for the Supervisory Board to provide consent, it is 
directly involved, especially in decisions of fundamental importance to the Company."
"In addition, the Supervisory 
Board and the Board of Management regularly discuss factors affecting the strategic orientation of the Volks-
wagen Group, including the sustainability strategy."

progress made in implementing the corporate strategy."
The Chair of the Board of Management is responsible for dealings with the Supervisory Board.

visory Board or its committees."

Board by the Board of Management can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board."
"Related party transactions 
The Audit Committee agreed on a suitable procedure with the Board of Management for ongoing monitoring of 
the Volkswagen Group’s related party transactions."
"As part of this procedure, the Board of Management ensures 
that related party transactions are generally at arm’s length using the best-price principle."
"In addition, all trans-
actions with the individual related parties are analyzed to determine whether they exceed the threshold of 1.5% 
of the Volkswagen Group’s total fixed and current assets, above which obligations under the rules on related 
party transactions apply (RPT threshold)."
"In addition, Procurement reports all transactions in which the volume of 
the contract exceeds the amount of €1 billion; in such cases, it is then checked separately whether the contrac-
tual partner is a related party within the meaning of the rules on related party transactions."
The Audit Committee continuously monitors the actions of the Board of Management.
"If and to the extent that the economic value of 
the related party transactions exceeds the RPT threshold, these transactions are also checked to establish 
whether they were conducted at arm’s length in accordance with proper business practice."
"If a transaction between Volkswagen AG and a related party exceeds the RPT threshold, the Supervisory 
Board’s approval is generally required except where exceptional circumstances exist in accordance with sec-
tion 111a(2) or (3) of the AktG."
"Insofar as the Supervisory Board’s approval is required, the Supervisory Board of 
Volkswagen AG generally decides as a full Board."
"There are no plans to form a committee that decides on the 
approval of related party transactions; however, the Supervisory Board reserves the right to establish such a 
committee if required in individual cases in accordance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act."
"Supervisory Board members who are involved in the transaction as related parties or whose relationship with the 
related party leads to concerns of a conflict of interest do not participate in decisions on the approval of related 
party transactions."
The Executive Committee decides on such approval.
"Diversity concept and succession planning for the Board of Management 
The Supervisory Board has laid down the following diversity concept for the composition of the Board of Man-
agement (section 289f(2) no."
"6 HGB): 
The Supervisory Board must also take diversity into account when considering who would be the best 
persons to appoint to the Board of Management as a body."
"The Supervisory Board understands diversity, as an 
assessment criterion, to mean in particular different yet complementary specialist profiles and professional and 
general experience, also in the international domain, with both genders being appropriately represented."
"The 
Supervisory Board will also take the following aspects into account in this regard, in particular: 
> Members of the Board of Management should have many years of management experience."
"> Members of the Board of Management should, if possible, have experience based on different training and 
professional backgrounds."
"> The Board of Management as a whole should have technical expertise, especially knowledge of and experi-
ence in the manufacture and sale of vehicles and engines of any kind as well as other technical products, and 
experience in the international domain."
"> The Board of Management as a whole should have many years of experience in research and development, 
production, sales, finance and human resources management, as well as law and compliance."
"46 
Group Corporate Governance Declaration
Corporate Governance 
> Efforts are made to achieve a higher proportion of women than the statutory minimum."
> The Board of Management should also have a sufficient mix of ages.
"The aim of the diversity concept is for the Board of Management members to embody a range of expertise and per-
spectives."
This diversity promotes a good understanding of Volkswagen AG’s organizational and business affairs.
"Particularly, it enables the members of the Board of Management to be open to new ideas by avoiding group-
think."
"In this way, it contributes to the successful management of the Company."
"With regard to the participation of 
women and men on the Board of Management, a mandatory participation requirement applies to Volkswagen AG."
"In deciding who should be appointed to a specific Board of Management position, the Supervisory Board 
takes into account the interests of the Company and all the circumstances of the specific case."
"In taking this 
decision and in long-term succession planning, the Supervisory Board orients itself on the diversity concept."
"The 
Supervisory Board is of the view that the diversity concept is essentially reflected by the current composition of 
the Board of Management."
"The members of the Board of Management have many years of professional experi-
ence, particularly in an international context, and cover a broad spectrum of educational and professional back-
grounds."
"The Board of Management collectively has excellent technical expertise and many years of collective 
experience in research and development, production, sales, finance and human resources management, as well 
as law and compliance."
"In addition, the Board of Management has a sufficient mix of ages that corresponds to 
the requirements set by the Supervisory Board in the diversity concept."
"The gender balance meets the legal 
requirements (see also section “Disclosures required by the Führungspositionen-Gesetz” (FüPoG - Act on Equal 
Participation of Women and Men in Leadership positions))."
"Long-term succession planning within the meaning of Recommendation B.2 of the Code is achieved through 
regular discussions between the Chair of the Board of Management and the Chair of the Supervisory Board as 
well as regular discussions in the Executive Committee."
"The contract terms for existing Board of Management 
members are discussed, along with potential extensions and potential successors."
"Long-term succession planning is based 
on the corporate strategy and corporate culture and takes into account the diversity concept determined by the 
Supervisory Board."
"Board of Management members may be appointed to serve beyond their 65th birthday 
until no later than their 68th birthday, provided this is agreed by a two-thirds majority of the Supervisory Board."
"SUPERVISORY BOARD 
The Volkswagen AG Supervisory Board performs its role through its members working together."
"It advises and 
monitors the Board of Management with regard to the management of the Company and, through the require-
ment for the Supervisory Board to provide consent, is directly involved in certain decisions of fundamental 
importance to the Company."
"Information on the composition of the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board committees and their 
chairs as well as on the terms of office of the individual Supervisory Board members can be found in the 
“Members of the Supervisory Board and Composition of the Committees” section."

staff and exercises the right to appoint and supervise staff in consultation with the responsible Board of Man-
agement members."
"The Supervisory Board appoints the Board of Management members and, on the basis of the Executive Com-
mittee’s recommendations, decides on a clear and comprehensible system of remuneration for the Board of 
Management members."

topics discussed are outlined in the “Report of the Supervisory Board”."
The Chair of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work within the Supervisory Board.
"He represents the 
interests of the Supervisory Board externally and represents the Company to the Board of Management on behalf 
of the whole Supervisory Board."
"Within reason, the Chair of the Supervisory Board discusses Supervisory Board-
specific topics with investors and, in consultation with the Board of Management, may also discuss non-Super-
visory Board-specific topics."
"More information on these discussions with investors is provided in the “Report of 
the Supervisory Board”."
"To underline the importance of environmental sustainability, social responsibility and good corporate gover-
nance, the Supervisory Board has appointed an ESG (environmental, social and governance) officer."

"If the Chair is 
unable to do so, the Deputy Chair performs these tasks."

"The Mediation Committee is comprised of two shareholder representatives and two employee representatives, 
and the Audit Committee is comprised of three shareholder representatives and three employee representatives."
"Which tasks the Supervisory Board has generally transferred to the respective committees is described 
below."
"This does not rule out that the Supervisory Board will not transfer other tasks to committees in individual 
cases, where legally admissible."
"The Executive Committee also exercises the function of a “Remuneration 
Committee”, preparing the Supervisory Board’s decisions on questions about Board of Management remuner-
ation."
The Executive Committee supports and advises the Chair of the Supervisory Board.
"It works with the Chair 
of the Board of Management to ensure long-term succession planning for the Board of Management."
"The Nomination Committee proposes suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board to recommend to the 
Annual General Meeting for election."

or revocation of appointment of Board of Management members if there is no majority for the relevant measure on 
the Supervisory Board in the first vote."

"> Proposals for election should not normally include persons who have reached the age of 75 on the date of the 
election."
The Supervisory Board is of the view that the above criteria have been met.
"Numerous members of the Super-
visory Board embody the criterion of internationality to a particularly high degree; various nationalities are 
represented on the Supervisory Board and numerous members have international professional experience."
"Several members of the Supervisory Board contribute to the Board’s diversity to a particularly high degree, 
especially Ms."
"Hessa Sultan Al Jaber, Ms."
"Julia Willie Hamburg, Ms."
"Marianne Heiß,  
Mr. Mansoor Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud and Mr. Matías Carnero Sojo."
"The Supervisory Board comprises members of 
various generations."
"Independent Supervisory Board members within the meaning of Recommendation C.6 of 
the Code currently comprise at least the following: Ms."
"Hessa Sultan Al Jaber, Ms."
"Julia Willie Hamburg,  
Mr. Mansoor Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud and Mr. Stephan Weil."
"However, considering all the circumstances of the case in hand, the shareholder representatives are of the 
opinion that the aforementioned Supervisory Board members are nevertheless independent from the Company 
and its Board of Management."
"The management by the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG 
therefore economically affects the personal assets of Mr. Hans Michel Piëch, Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and 
Mr. Wolfgang Porsche."
"50 
Group Corporate Governance Declaration
Corporate Governance 
> The composition of the Board of Management has changed fundamentally several times during the tenure of 
Mr. Hans Michel Piëch, Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Mr. Wolfgang Porsche."
"The incumbent Board of Man-
agement members have been in office for a maximum of just under six years."
"There are therefore no indications 
that Mr. Hans Michel Piëch, Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Mr. Wolfgang Porsche would stop behaving in an 
impartial manner towards incumbent members of the Board of Management as a result of a long period of 
collaboration."
"There is also no other evidence of “tunnel vision” on the part of Mr. Hans Michel Piëch, 
Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Mr. Wolfgang Porsche."
"> Mr. Hans Michel Piëch, Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Mr. Wolfgang Porsche are not financially dependent 
on their remuneration as members of the Supervisory Board."
"Aside from their Supervisory Board appointments, Mr. Hans Michel Piëch, Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and 
Mr. Wolfgang Porsche have no personal relationship with the Company or the Board of Management that could 
give rise to a material and not merely temporary conflict of interest."
"The Supervisory Board work of Mr. Hans 
Michel Piëch, Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Mr. Wolfgang Porsche of previous years has also not given rise to 
any conflicts of interest."
"The Supervisory Board member Mr. Hans Dieter Pötsch moved directly from the Board of Management to the 
Supervisory Board upon his appointment by the court in autumn 2015."
"This move was less than two years prior 
to his election as a Supervisory Board member by the subsequent Annual General Meeting in 2016, meaning that 
one of the indicators of a lack of independence from the Company and Board of Management, set out in C.7 of 
the Code, applies to Mr. Pötsch."
It also cannot be ruled out that Mr. Pötsch still fulfills this requirement.
"Mr. Pötsch has already 
been elected as a member of the Supervisory Board for a second time by the Annual General Meeting in July 
2021."
"Since his transfer from the Board of Management to the Supervisory Board in October 2015, the com-
position of the Board of Management has also completely changed."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board adopted the following profile of skills and expertise for the full Board: to 
properly perform its supervisory and advisory duties, the Supervisory Board as a whole must collectively have 
the required expertise, i.e."
"knowledge, skills and professional experience."
"For this, the members of the Super-
visory Board must collectively be familiar with the sector in which the Company operates – i.e."
"the automotive 
industry – and be able to assess the business conducted by the Company."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board 
members as a whole must collectively have expertise relating to sustainability issues relevant to the Company."
"The Supervisory Board has also specified the following diversity concept for its composition: 
> The Supervisory Board must be comprised such that its members collectively have the knowledge, skills, and 
professional experience needed to properly perform their duties."
"> It has therefore set targets for its composition that also take into account the recommendations of the German 
Corporate Governance Code."
"The targets set by the Supervisory Board for its composition also describe the 
concept through which the Supervisory Board as a whole strives to achieve a diverse composition (diversity 
concept in accordance with section 289f(2) no."
"Attention should also be generally paid to 
diversity when seeking qualified individuals to best strengthen the specialist and managerial expertise of the 
Supervisory Board as a whole in line with these targets."
"A wide range of experience and specialist knowledge should be represented on the 
Supervisory Board."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board should collectively have an extensive range of opinions 
and knowledge in order to develop a good understanding of the status quo and the longer-term opportunities 
and risks in connection with the Company’s business activities."
"However, the Annual General Meeting is not obliged to accept the candidates nomi-
nated."
"> The aim of the diversity concept is for the Supervisory Board members to embody a range of expertise and 
perspectives."
"This diversity promotes a good understanding of Volkswagen AG’s organizational and business 
affairs."
"It also enables the Supervisory Board members to challenge the Board of Management’s decisions 
constructively and to be open to new ideas by avoiding groupthink."
"In this way, it contributes to the effective 
supervision of the management."
"The Supervisory Board and Nomination Committee, in particular, are called upon to implement the profile of 
skills and expertise and the diversity concept within the context of their candidate proposals to the Annual 
General Meeting."
"The same applies to individuals entitled to make proposals should a 
court-appointed replacement be necessary."
"The current composition of the Supervisory Board implements both the diversity concept and the profile of 
skills and expertise."
"The qualification matrix below shows the extent to which the profile of skills and expertise 
has been implemented, and indicates which Supervisory Board member has which skills and expertise."
"A skill can be attributed to a Supervisory Board 
member even if they have expertise in just one subsection of the skill, i.e."
"for skill in vehicles, for example, either in the area of manufacture or in sales."
"The allocation of 
competencies is based on a self-assessment by the respective Supervisory Board member."
"In addition, several Supervisory Board members, including Mr. Mansoor Al-Mahmoud, Ms."
"Marianne Heiß,  
Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Mr. Hans Dieter Pötsch, have expertise in both financial reporting, including 
sustainability reporting, and auditing, including the audit and assurance of sustainability reporting."
"Mr. Al-Mahmoud therefore also studies  
 
 
 
 
53 
Group Corporate Governance Declaration
Corporate Governance 
companies’ sustainability reports in detail with a view to whether they fit the Qatar Investment Authority’s sus-
tainability strategy."
"As part of their long-
standing work in audit committees, Ms."
"Heiß, Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Mr. Pötsch have also been 
involved in the auditing and assurance of nonfinancial statements, which relate to sustainability in the form of 
important environmental and social issues."
"Heiß was also involved in sustainability reporting and the 
auditing and assurance thereof as part of her former activities at BBDO Group Germany GmbH, and Mr. Pötsch as 
part of his activities at Porsche Automobil Holding SE."
"Heiß is also an ESG expert on the Supervisory Board 
of Porsche Automobil Holding SE."
"Heiß, Mr. Al-Mahmoud, Mr. Pötsch and Mr. Ferdinand Oliver Porsche track 
and monitor the latest developments in the area of sustainability reporting and the auditing and assurance 
thereof and contribute their expertise to Volkswagen AG’s Audit Committee."
Further details on the expertise of the Supervisory Board members can be found in their curricula vitae.
"The 
curricula vitae of the members of the Supervisory Board, which are updated annually, are available online at 
www.volkswagen-group.com/executive-bodies."
"The composition 
targets, diversity concept and profile of skills and expertise were also taken into account in the court appoint-
ment of two new Supervisory Board members as employee representatives in fiscal year 2023."
"Self-evaluation of the Supervisory Board 
On a regular basis every two years, the Supervisory Board internally evaluates how effectively the Board and its 
committees are performing their tasks."
"In par-
ticular, the members of the Supervisory Board are also asked to make comparative observations with comparable 
boards of other companies on which they also serve and, drawing on these, to make specific suggestions for 
improvement as required."
"Following analysis of the questionnaires, the findings and potential improvements are 
usually discussed at the next regular meeting of the full Board."
"Measures to improve the work of the Supervisory 
Board are continuously developed and implemented on the basis of the findings."
"The Supervisory Board 
members assess whether the measures have achieved the targeted improvements at the latest in the next self-
evaluation."
The most recent internal self-evaluation took place from late 2023 to early 2024.
"Shareholder and employee representatives have resolved that each 
side will meet this quota separately."
"The shareholder representatives have met the quota of at least 30% women 
and at least 30% men since the end of the 56th Annual General Meeting on June 22, 2016."
"The employee repre-
sentatives have met the quota since the end of the 57th Annual General Meeting on May 10, 2017."
"Both the 
shareholder and the employee representatives also fulfilled the quota on December 31, 2023."
"The participation requirement has applied to 
the appointment of one or more members of the Board of Management since August 1, 2022."
"Volkswagen AG 
complies with this participation requirement."
"As 
of December 31, 2023, the proportion of women in the active workforce at the first level of management was 
15.3 (14.2)% and at the second level of management it was 21.5 (19.7)%."

Remuneration Report 2023
Corporate Governance 
A."
"REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 
In the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group’s business was impacted by the challenging global market environ-
ment, parts supply shortages and disruptions in the logistics chain."
"In this environment, the Group delivered 
9.2 million units to customers."
This was 11.8% more vehicles than in the previous year.
"While sales revenue rose 
by 15.5%, the operating result of €22.6 billion was similar to the previous year’s."
"Principles of Board of Management remuneration 
The remuneration of the Board of Management is based on the remuneration system developed by the Super-
visory Board and adopted for the first time on December 14, 2020 with effect from January 1, 2021."
"On March 3, 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved to modify the remuneration system with effect from 
January 1, 2023, particularly to heed the call by investors to give long-term variable remuneration more weight."
"This led to the relative share of the fixed remuneration components being reduced and the relative share of the 
long-term variable remuneration being increased."
"To reinforce the principle of pay for performance and imple-
ment investors’ requirements, it is also no longer possible to agree a special bonus with future effect."
"In addition, 
the maximum target achievement levels for the annual bonus and the performance share plan as well as their 
respective maximum payout amounts have been increased so that higher levels of target achievement are 
appropriately rewarded."
"In this context, the maximum remuneration and the cap on cash remuneration have also 
been increased to reflect current market conditions."
"The Annual General Meeting approved the modified remu-
neration system on May 10, 2023 with 98.82% of the votes cast."
"The modified remuneration system has applied since January 1, 2023 to all Board of Management members 
with service contracts newly concluded or renewed after the Annual General Meeting’s approval of the remu-
neration system on May 10, 2023."
"For the Board of Management members already appointed at the time of the 
Annual General Meeting’s approval of the remuneration system on May 10, 2023, the new remuneration system 
has also applied in principle since January 1, 2023."
"In this report, we explain the main 
features of the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management and 
Supervisory Board."
"The remuneration report also contains an individualized breakdown of 
the remuneration components provided to current and former members of the  
Board of Management and Supervisory Board."

service contracts."
"Penalty and clawback rules will only apply to Board of Management members already appointed before 
December 14, 2020 on renewal of their contracts."
"In fiscal year 2023, these exceptions only applied to  
Mr. Markus Duesmann; Mr. Duesmann stepped down from the Board of Management in the course of the year."
"The level of the Board of Management remuneration should be appropriate and attractive in the context of 
the Company’s national and international peer group."
"In this context, comparative 
studies on remuneration are conducted on a regular basis."
"In the Remuneration Report for fiscal year 2022, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board reported in 
detail on the remuneration paid to members of the Board of Management in fiscal year 2022."
"The Annual General 
Meeting on May 10, 2023 approved the Remuneration Report for fiscal year 2022 with a majority of 98.47% of 
the votes cast."
"In this chapter, we provide an overview of the remuneration system for the Board of Management members in 
fiscal year 2023 before going into the components of the remuneration in fiscal year 2023."
"Overview of the remuneration components 
The table below provides an overview of the components of the remuneration system applicable for fiscal year 
2023 for the members of the Board of Management."
"The table also outlines the composition of the individual 
remuneration components and explains their targets, particularly in respect of how the remuneration will pro-
mote the Company’s long-term performance."
"A more detailed description of the remuneration system applicable 
for fiscal year 2023 for the members of the Board of Management is available at www.volkswagen-group.com/ 
remuneration."
"Chinese joint ventures2 (proportionate) (50%) and 
operating return on sales (50%) 
 The Supervisory Board defines minimum, target and maximum values for the 
financial subtargets for each fiscal year."
"1 Mr. Blume receives from Volkswagen AG 50% of the remuneration for the Chair of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG and from Porsche AG 50% of the remuneration for 
the Chair of the Executive Board of Porsche AG."
"The target amount for Mr. Blume thus corresponds to half of the target amount for a Chair of the Board of Management who 
receives the full remuneration of a Chair of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG."
2 Equity-accounted companies in China.
"The EPS (earnings per share) 
financial performance target in 
conjunction with share price performance 
and the dividends paid, measured over 
four years, ensures the long-term effect of 
the behavioral incentives and supports the 
strategic target of achieving competitive 
profitability."
"In 
all other respects, the performance share plan corresponds mutatis mutandis to that described for fiscal year 2023."
"2 Mr. Blume receives from Volkswagen AG 50% of the remuneration for the Chair of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG and from Porsche AG 50% of the remuneration for 
the Chair of the Executive Board of Porsche AG."
"The target amount for Mr. Blume thus corresponds to half of the target amount for a Chair of the Board of Management who 
receives the full remuneration of a Chair of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG."
"Remuneration of the Board of Management members appointed in fiscal year 2023 
1."
"If such remuneration is nevertheless granted, it is counted toward the remuneration for 
their work as a member of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG."
"A different arrangement has been reached with Mr. Blume with regard to the performance of his duties as 
Chair of the Executive Board of Dr. Ing."
"However, 
Porsche AG reimburses Volkswagen AG half of the expenses for fringe benefits."
"Since January 1, 2023, 
Porsche AG has granted Mr. Blume 50% of the remuneration for the Chair of the Executive Board of Porsche AG."
This remuneration is based on the remuneration system for the members of the Executive Board of Porsche AG.
"Mr. Blume receives from Porsche AG a base salary, one-year variable remuneration (STI) and multi-year variable 
remuneration (LTI); Mr. Blume does not receive fringe benefits from Porsche AG."
"In addition, Porsche AG grants 
Mr. Blume an occupational retirement provision in the form of a defined contribution plan."
"In preparation for the 
IPO completed on September 29, 2022, Porsche AG agreed on an IPO bonus for Mr. Blume."
"This IPO bonus is 
structured as a share plan with a one-, two- and three-year term, in each case starting from the time of the IPO."
"Remuneration granted to Mr. Blume by Porsche AG is counted towards the cap on cash remuneration and  
Mr. Blume’s maximum remuneration at Volkswagen AG."
"In the overview in the tables of the remuneration granted 
and owed to Mr. Blume in fiscal year 2023, the remuneration components granted to Mr. Blume by Porsche AG 
are included and shown separately."
"A different arrangement has also been reached with Mr. Brandstätter for his work at Volkswagen (China) 
Investment Company Limited: Mr. Brandstätter receives a separate remuneration for his work as CEO of Volks-
wagen (China) Investment Company Limited."
"Mr. Brandstätter’s contractual remuneration under his contract of 
employment with Volkswagen AG is reduced accordingly for the duration of his work at Volkswagen (China) 
Investment Company Limited."
"Remuneration granted and owed in fiscal year 2023 
In accordance with section 162(1) sentence 1 of the AktG, the remuneration report must report on the remu-
neration granted and owed to each individual member of the Board of Management in the last fiscal year."
"These 
terms are understood as follows: 
The term “granted” (gewährt) refers to the actual receipt (Zufluss) of the remuneration component."
"The term “owed” (geschuldet) refers to all legally existing liabilities for remuneration components that are due 
but have not yet been fulfilled."
"Overview in the tables 
The following tables show the remuneration actually received by members of the Board of Management in fiscal 
year 2023."
The time of actual payment is not relevant.
"The remuneration components granted 
to Mr. Blume by Porsche AG are presented in the same way."
"The relative shares shown in the tables relate to the remuneration components granted and owed in the 
respective fiscal year in accordance with section 162(1) sentence 1 of the AktG."
"They thus include all benefits 
actually received in the respective fiscal year, regardless of the fiscal year for which the Board of Management 
members received them."
"The relative shares indicated here are thus not comparable with the respective relative 
shares of fixed and variable remuneration components as part of total remuneration in the description of the 
remuneration system according to section 87a(1) sentence 2 no."
"The shares indicated in the 
remuneration system relate to the targets agreed for the relevant fiscal year, irrespective of the time at which the 
respective remuneration component was paid out."
Pension expense is reported as service cost within the meaning of IAS 19.
"The service cost in accordance 
with IAS 19 does not constitute remuneration granted or owed within the meaning of section 162(1) sentence 1 
of the AktG as it is not actually received by the Board of Management member in the reporting year."
"Maximum remuneration corresponds to maximum remuneration within the meaning of section 87a(1) sen-
tence 2 no."
"1 of the AktG in accordance with the remuneration system adopted by the Supervisory Board and 
approved by the Annual General Meeting."
"On December 14, 2020, the Supervisory Board adopted a remuneration system for the members of the Board 
of Management based for the first time on the requirements of ARUG II."
"Board of Management service contracts 
newly agreed or renewed since that time also contain the penalty and clawback rules provided for in this remu-
neration system."
"Accordingly, only Mr. Duesmann’s service contract, which was concluded before December 13, 
2020, does not contain a penalty and clawback provision."
"Mr. Duesmann stepped down from the Board of 
Management with effect from August 31, 2023."
"Volkswagen AG did not make use of the existing penalty and 
clawback rules in fiscal year 2023."

separately according to whether they were granted by Volkswagen AG or by Porsche AG."
2 The LTI paid out in fiscal year 2023 was for work performed in fiscal year 2020.
"Mr. Blume did not receive any long-term variable remuneration from 
Porsche AG in fiscal year 2020 that would have to be counted towards the remuneration he receives from Volkswagen AG."

"The sentiment rating is an important parameter of the opinion survey – an employee poll with 
which the Group regularly gathers information regarding employee satisfaction."
"The diversity index is used 
worldwide to determine the development of the proportion of women in management and the internationali-
zation of top management."
The indicator provides incentives for an exemplary leadership and corporate culture.
"The governance factor is a means for the Supervisory Board to express its satisfaction with the expected and 
actual behavior of the Board of Management with regard to the criteria of integrity and compliance."
"As a rule, the 
governance factor should be 1.0 and may only be reduced to 0.9 or raised to 1.1 in exceptional circumstances 
based on a professional judgment of the Supervisory Board."
"The LTI with the per-
formance period 2020–2022 that was paid out in fiscal year 2023 and reported in this remuneration report as 
remuneration granted and owed had a maximum value for the EPS performance measurement of 150%."
"b) Performance criteria for the long-term incentive (LTI) 
The four-year performance share plan has applied since January 1, 2021 to all Board of Management members 
with service contracts newly concluded or renewed after the Supervisory Board resolution of December 14, 2020."
"For the Board of Management members already appointed at the time of the Supervisory Board resolution of 
December 14, 2020, a three-year performance period continues to apply until their contracts are renewed."
"In 
fiscal year 2023, this concerned only Mr. Duesmann, who stepped down in the course of the year."
"The performance share plans for the 
performance periods 2021–2023 or 2021–2024, 2022–2024 or 2022–2025 and 2023–2025 or 2023–2026 were 
not due in fiscal year 2023 and have not yet been paid out; they therefore do not constitute remuneration granted 
or owed in fiscal year 2023."
"2.2.2 Conformity with the remuneration system 
The remuneration granted and owed to the Board of Management members in fiscal year 2023 meets the 
requirements of the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management."
"There was no deviation 
from the applicable remuneration system in fiscal year 2023."
"The total remuneration granted and owed to the Board of 
Management members in fiscal year 2023 did not exceed the maximum remuneration envisaged by the remu-
neration system."
"Since January 1, 2023, Volkswagen AG has granted Mr. Blume 50% of the remuneration for the 
Chair of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG on the basis of the newly concluded service contract."
"In 
derogation of this, Volkswagen AG grants Mr. Blume the full amount of the fringe benefit allowance for the Chair 
of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG."
Mr. Blume is also Chair of the Executive Board of Porsche AG.
"Since January 1, 2023, Porsche AG has granted Mr. Blume 50% of the remuneration for a Chair of the Executive 
Board of Porsche AG."
"In preparation for the IPO completed on September 29, 2022, Porsche AG agreed on an IPO 
bonus for Mr. Blume."
"This IPO bonus is structured as a share plan with a one-, two- and three-year term, in each 
case starting from the time of the IPO."
"Mr. Blume was allocated a total of 19,290 phantom preferred shares in 
Porsche AG in fiscal year 2022, divided into three tranches of 6,430 phantom preferred shares each."
"Any remu-
neration granted and owed from this IPO bonus will be reported in the remuneration report for the fiscal year

in which the respective tranche is paid out to Mr. Blume."
The first tranche was paid out in fiscal year 2023.
"As a 
precaution, Volkswagen AG approved the remuneration from Porsche AG as a third-party remuneration arrange-
ment."
"The remuneration granted to Mr. Blume by Porsche AG is counted towards the maximum remuneration and 
the cap on cash remuneration of Volkswagen AG."
"Any 
temporary benefits for new Board of Management members are excluded from the calculation."
"Should a Board of 
Management member leave during the course of the first fiscal year of the appointment, the calculation may by 
way of exception be based on the expected total remuneration for the current fiscal year."
"The severance payment 
will be paid as a one-off payment or in a maximum of 24 monthly installments from the time of the termination of 
the appointment as a member of the Company’s Board of Management."
"Contractual remuneration paid by the 
Company for the period from the termination of the appointment until the end of the service contract will be 
offset against the severance payment."
"Should Board of Management members take up other work after the 
termination of their appointment, the amount of the severance payment will be reduced by the amount of the 
income earned from that work."
"Should a post-contractual non-compete covenant be agreed, the severance 
payment will be offset against the compensation received for observing the post-contractual non-compete 
covenant."
"The members of the Board of Management are also entitled to a pension and to a surviving dependents’ 
pension as well as the use of company cars for the period in which they receive their pension in the event of early 
termination of their service on the Board of Management."
"Also in the case of early termination, the variable remuneration components will generally be paid at the 
contractually agreed maturity dates in accordance with the terms of the contract."
"There will be no early calcu-
lation and payout – except where the employment relationship ends due to permanent disability or death."
"The 
remuneration system for members of the Board of Management does not include a commitment to grant shares 
in Volkswagen AG."
"Members of the Board of Management are therefore not entitled to payments agreed in the 
event of a change of control or to other special benefits (for example a commitment to grant shares) from Volks-
wagen AG."
"The agreed benefits are paid or made available when the 
Board of Management member reaches the age of 65, or in Mr. Blume’s and Mr. Kilian’s case, when they reach the 
age of 63."
"The Board of Management members received a defined contribution plan, which is based in principle on a 
works agreement that also applies to the employees of Volkswagen AG covered by collective agreements and 
includes retirement, invalidity and surviving dependents’ benefits."
"A pension contribution in the amount of 40% 
of the base salary is paid to Volkswagen Pension Trust e.V."
"at the end of the calendar year for each year they are 
appointed to the Board of Management."
"Since fiscal year 2023, the pension contribution for Mr. Blume has been 
50% of his base salary."
No other changes were made to the defined contribution plans in fiscal year 2023.
"The 
annual pension contributions result in modules of what is, in principle, a lifelong pension in line with the arrange-
ments that also apply to employees covered by collective agreements."
The individual pension modules vest immediately upon payment to Volkswagen Pension Trust e.V.
"Instead of 
a lifelong pension, benefits can optionally be paid out as a lump sum or in installments when the beneficiary 
reaches retirement age."
"The overview on the previous page shows the pensions for the individual members of the Board of Manage-
ment in fiscal year 2023, indicating the present value and the pension expense for the Company during the last 
fiscal year."
"c) Benefits and pension commitments to Board of Management members who left in fiscal year 2023 
In fiscal year 2023, Mr. Duesmann stepped down from the Board of Management."
"Mr. Duesmann was originally 
appointed as a member of the Volkswagen AG Board of Management until the close of March 31, 2025 and had 
additionally been appointed as a member of the Board of Management of AUDI AG and as its Chair."
"Due to this termination, Volkswagen AG and AUDI AG concluded a termination agreement with 
Mr. Duesmann."
"The subject of this termination agreement included the continuation of the service contract 
between Mr. Duesmann and Volkswagen AG until its regular termination date, i.e."
"The 
service contract between Mr. Duesmann and AUDI AG was terminated with effect from August 31, 2023."
"Volks-
wagen AG agreed to continue paying Mr. Duesmann his remuneration until the termination date of his service 
contract."
"Variable remuneration components will be paid at the contractually agreed time; there will be no early 
calculation and payout."
The annual bonus will be based in each case on a Governance factor of 1.0.
"Mr. Dues-
mann does not receive a severance payment from Volkswagen AG in the form of a one-off payment."
"The maxi-
mum remuneration and the cap on cash remuneration continue to apply to the remuneration to be paid."
"From 
April 1, 2025, Mr. Duesmann will be subject to a one-year post-contractual non-compete covenant, for which 
Volkswagen AG will pay him gross monthly compensation of €187,500."
"2.2.4 No clawback claims in fiscal year 2023 
Volkswagen AG did not seek to claw back any variable remuneration components from individual Board of 
Management members in fiscal year 2023."
The prerequisites for a clawback claim did not apply.

"Remuneration of former Board of Management members 
In accordance with section 162(1) sentence 1 of the AktG, the remuneration granted and owed to former 
members of the Board of Management must also be reported."
"The following tables show the remuneration granted and owed in fiscal year 2023 to the individual former 
members of the Board of Management who left after fiscal year 2013."
"As with the current Board of Management 
members, the annual bonus paid at the beginning of 2024 to former Board of Management members for the 
2023 fiscal year is counted as remuneration granted in fiscal year 2023."
"A total 
of €8.1 million was granted and owed to such former Board of Management members and their surviving 
dependents in fiscal year 2023."
"Obligations for pensions for this group of persons measured in accordance with 
IAS 19 amounted to €91.2 million."
"The table shows his remuneration after his departure from the Board of 
Management."
"For members of the Board of Management, 
the remuneration granted and owed in the reporting year is placed in relation to the equivalent figure for the 
previous year."
Earnings performance is shown on the basis of Volkswagen AG’s net income or loss for the year.
"However, the 
remuneration of the Board of Management members is based on Group KPIs."
"This 
means that Group KPIs are not only applied in calculating the remuneration of the Board of Management mem-
bers but also in determining earnings performance."
"The Group KPIs used in determining earnings performance 
show the overall effect of the business activities for which the Board of Management is responsible."
"The comparison with the growth in average employee remuneration is based on the personnel expenses of 
Volkswagen AG reported in the notes to the annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG, adjusted for the 
remuneration of the members of the Board of Management."
"These adjusted personnel expenses are divided by 
the number of full-time-equivalent employees of Volkswagen AG as of December 31, 2023, excluding the mem-
bers of the Board of Management."
"Peer group 
The Supervisory Board regularly reviews and, if necessary, adjusts the level of the remuneration, the total 
remuneration cap and the individual targets."
"Among other things, the Supervisory Board performs a vertical 
comparison with the remuneration and employment terms of the Company’s employees and a horizontal 
comparison with the remuneration and employment terms of other companies’ management board members."
"The Supervisory Board conducts a comparison with what it considers to be a suitable peer group to assess 
whether the specific total remuneration paid to the members of the Board of Management is customary when 
measured against that paid in other companies."
"This peer group is regularly reviewed – most recently at the end 
of 2023 – and adjusted if necessary."
"The peer group currently comprises the following companies: BMW, Mer-
cedes-Benz Group, Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Nissan Motor Corporation, Toyota, BYD, Tesla (excluding CEO), 
hp, IBM, Uber, SAP, Samsung, General Electric, Siemens, Hitachi and Boeing."
"The companies in the peer group 
were chosen to reflect the Volkswagen Group’s strategic business fields."
"The peer group used up to and 
including 2020 was revised and last adjusted following the adoption of the “TOGETHER 2025” strategy."
"In addition, the peer group 
includes selected global industrial corporations that, in the view of the Supervisory Board, appear comparable 
with the Volkswagen Group in terms of their development focus, vertical integration, global orientation and level 
of complexity."
"In the view of the Supervisory Board, the composition of this peer group is representative of the 
Volkswagen Group’s specific competitive environment in the sales market and in the recruitment market for top 
executives."

I."
"Principles of Supervisory Board remuneration 
Following its regular review of Supervisory Board remuneration, the Supervisory Board proposed an adjustment 
of the remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board to the 2023 Annual General Meeting."
"The 
proposed adjustment of the Supervisory Board remuneration system was approved by the Annual General 
Meeting on May 10, 2023 with 99.99% of the votes cast."
"The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory 
Board is governed by Article 17 of the Articles of Association of Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft."
"The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG and remuneration for super-
visory board work at subsidiaries is comprised entirely of non-performance-related remuneration components."
"Overview of remuneration 
The members of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG receive fixed remuneration of €170,000 per fiscal year."
"The Chair of the Supervisory Board receives fixed remuneration of €510,000; the Deputy Chair receives fixed 
remuneration of €340,000."
"For their work in the Supervisory Board committees, the members of the Supervisory Board also receive 
additional fixed remuneration of €75,000 per committee and fiscal year provided the committee met at least 
once that year for the performance of its duties."
"Membership of the Nomination and Mediation Committees 
established in accordance with section 27(3) of the Mitbestimmungsgesetz (MitbestG – German Codetermina-
tion Act) are not taken into account."
"Committee chairs receive double this amount, while the deputy chairs 
receive one-and-a-half times the committee remuneration listed previously."
"Remuneration is paid for work on a 
maximum of two committees, whereby the two most highly remunerated functions are taken into account if this 
maximum is exceeded."
"Supervisory Board members who belonged to the Supervisory Board or one of its 
committees for only part of the fiscal year receive remuneration on a pro rata temporis basis."
"Any value-added 
tax incurred on the remuneration is reimbursed by the Company."
"Supervisory Board members receive an attendance fee of €1,000 for attending a meeting of the Supervisory 
Board or one of its committees; if several meetings take place on the same day, the attendance fee is paid only 
once."
The remuneration and attendance fees are each payable after the end of the fiscal year.
"The remuneration enables suitable, qualified candidates to be recruited to the Supervisory Board."
"As such, 
the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board contributes to the ability of the Supervisory Board as 
a whole to properly and competently perform its duties of monitoring and advising the Board of Management."
Restricting the payment to fixed remuneration is also appropriate to the duties of the Supervisory Board.
"The 
restriction provides the Supervisory Board members with an incentive in their monitoring and advisory duties to 
properly scrutinize the activities of the Board of Management without being guided primarily by the performance 
of key operating ratios."
"Former members of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG do not receive any remuneration for the period 
following the termination of office."

out by the Company in their interest."
The Company paid the premiums for the D&O insurance.

The strategy’s focus is the world of mobility in 2030.
"As technology advances, the automotive industry is rapidly forging ahead with its transformation toward  
e-mobility and digitalization."
"We therefore expect the market for electric vehicles to continue to grow in the next 
few years, meaning that the cost-efficient and sustainable production of battery systems and the expansion of 
the charging infrastructure will be crucial to success."
"The shift to connected, intelligent and eventually self-driving vehicles will, however, bring more wide-
reaching changes for the automotive industry."
"Autonomous driving will change the customer’s mobility expe-
rience forever and lay the ground for new business models."
"Sources of revenue will gradually shift and will 
expand beyond the core product of the automobile."
"Increasing software development capabilities in order to 
excite customers with constantly improving digital functionality is the prerequisite for this."
"In equal measure to technological trends, the global economic and geopolitical environment is also posing 
increased challenges for the automotive industry."
"These include, for example, the economic influence of the 
largest mobility market, China, the USA and Europe, and their diverging development."
"As 
we transition from automotive manufacturer to mobility group, we have reset our priorities with NEW AUTO and 
are positioning ourselves for the future."
"We are keeping our aim of being a world-leading provider of sustainable 
mobility firmly in our sights and making the Group more focused, efficient, innovative, customer-oriented and 
sustainable, as well as systematically gearing it toward profitable growth."
"To this end, we have established clearly defined Group initiatives across the brand groups, with a focus on our 
central technology platforms: “Architecture”, “Software”, “Battery, Charging & Energy”, and “Volkswagen Group 
Mobility”."
"Furthermore, base initiatives form the foundation for the Volkswagen Group’s strategic realignment."
"These are “ESG, Decarbonization & Integrity”, “Business Model 2.0”, “North America (NAR) Region”, “China Region”, 
“Group Steering Model”, “People & Transformation” and “Financing the Transformation”, which are described 
below."

With the Group strategy “NEW AUTO – Mobility for generations to come”, we are preparing 
ourselves for the global changes in mobility and thus playing a substantial role in driving 
Volkswagen’s transformation into a provider of sustainable mobility."

Goals and Strategies
Group Management Report 
NEW AUTO FOCUSING ON THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS 
 
The most important targets for each calendar year are defined and a Top 10 program is developed at Group level 
so that the strategy can be implemented in operations throughout the year."
"Priorities in the Group’s Top 10 
program for 2023 were financial robustness and planning, products, the China and North America regions, 
software, technologies, battery and charging, mobility solutions, sustainability, and capital markets."
"This Top 10 
program methodology has been adopted by many business units in their functional area strategies and is being 
used to accelerate implementation of the strategy with a high level of focus."
"Accordingly, strategic objectives 
and envisaged key results are defined for all focus topics."
"These are to be realized largely through time-limited 
projects and work packages, each of which is measured by specific key performance indicators."
"The degree of 
achievement is usually presented to the Board of Management three times a year."
"As such, the relevance of the 
focus topics, and their objectives, milestones, projects and work packages, are regularly reviewed at Group level."
Their focus is continuously monitored and adjusted as necessary or integrated into standard operations.
"We report on the main objectives and interim results achieved in the reporting year in the chapters “Internal 
Management System and Key Performance Indicators”, “Structure and Business Activities” and “Sustainable 
Value Enhancement”."
"ARCHITECTURE 
A future-oriented mechatronics platform will form the backbone for innovations, technology and lasting 
competitiveness at Volkswagen."
"With the Scalable Systems Platform (SSP), we are creating the next generation 
of an all-electric, fully digital and highly scalable mechatronics platform based on a standardized software 
architecture."
"With this standardized platform, which can be scaled from the smallest vehicles all the way up to 
the premium segment, the Volkswagen Group aims to rapidly and efficiently provide its customers with inno-
vative functions and technologies in their vehicles, across all brands."
"By reducing complexity and the number of 
versions, the SSP will offer maximum synergies and make fast, regular technology updates possible, while 
lowering investment costs and ensuring the necessary differentiation between the products of the individual 
brands in the Group’s portfolio."
"Here we are pursuing the following strategy: we intend to develop software for central control 
points in the vehicle either in-house or together with third parties in strategic partnerships."
"CARIAD is collab-
orating with leading technology companies to integrate further innovative solutions."
"In the long term, the standardized E3 2.0 software architecture is to form the basis of a complete digital 
ecosystem, offering customers a wide range of software-based services throughout the entire product lifecycle."
The software-centric approach of the E³ 2.0 architecture constitutes a paradigm shift in vehicle development.
This is to form the basis for the Volkswagen Group’s software-defined vehicles.
"The aim is for every function that 
is needed or requested, and for every service, to be customized for the customers in the various markets and to 
be available for download at any time."
This will also open up new sources of revenue for us.
"Applications at various levels of automated driving (up to Level 4) are to be gradually introduced to the new 
vehicle models in the Group brands."
"In this context, CARIAD is responsible for developing software and a tech-
nology stack for automated driving."
"BATTERY, CHARGING & ENERGY – CELL AND BATTERY STRATEGY 
The battery is a key component in an electric vehicle, and an important cost factor."
"The appeal and market 
success of e-mobility is determined not only by the price, but also by the vehicle’s range and its charging speed."
"In order to achieve our objective of transforming into a world-leading provider of sustainable mobility, we intend 
to become a profit-generating expert across the entire battery life cycle."
"To this end, the Cell and Battery 
Strategy tech initiative pools expertise across the Group and is driving the transformation process in cooperation 
with our strategic partners."
"The aspects covered include battery development, cell production, vertical integration, large-scale storage 
systems and recycling."
"Our primary aim is to develop battery cell technology into a core competence in the 
Group, and we are also working with partners to achieve this."
"At the heart of this strategy is the unified cell, 
which can contain differing chemistries and is to be used in up to 80% of Group models by 2030."
"The economies 
of scale this generates are expected to reduce costs by up to 50% and put us in a leading cost position."
"To cover 
the high demand for battery cells, Volkswagen plans to build its own gigafactories around the world."
"The corner-
stone for these activities was laid in Salzgitter/Germany."
"Using the standard factory concept to optimize invest-
ment, further factories are to follow swiftly in Valencia/Spain and St."
"The aim is to meet about 
half of the rapidly growing need for battery cells ourselves by 2030."
"BATTERY, CHARGING & ENERGY – CHARGING AND ENERGY SERVICES 
A sustainable, stable charging and energy infrastructure is a key prerequisite for accelerating the transformation 
to the battery-electric mobility of the future."
"It is therefore our intention to also become a comprehensive 
charging and energy service provider in future and we are investing heavily in the worldwide development of an 
open, fast-charging network."
"By 2025, we and our partners plan to create around 45,000 high-power charging 
points in Europe, China and the USA."
"The product portfolio also includes the full range of charging solutions for 
private customers and companies."
"In addition to our own wall box and flexible fast-charging station (Flexpole), 
the focus is particularly on contract-based charging services and smart green electricity tariffs."
"The aim is for 
charging processes to be controlled in such a way that they tap into renewable energy, thus reducing the 
pressure on the power grids."
"In a next step, Volkswagen intends to use the electric vehicle as a mobile power

bank, and thus help to enable electric vehicles to act as additional storage units and become an active part of 
the energy system in the future."
"In this way, Volkswagen wishes to make its customers part of the smart-
charging and energy ecosystem for decarbonized mobility."
"Our goal here is farsighted use of scarce resources in 
the electric power industry."
"VOLKSWAGEN GROUP MOBILITY  
In keeping with its mission statement, “Mobility for generations to come”, the Volkswagen Group is developing 
mobility solutions for the future, taking into account global trends and changes in customer needs."
"The Group 
plans to bring together all of its brands’ mobility services on one mobility platform over the coming years."
"Autonomous driving combined with new mobility solutions is expected to mark Volkswagen’s transformation 
into a leading provider of sustainable mobility."
"A vehicle fleet covering all of the many services, from vehicle 
rental to car subscription and ride pooling, is to ensure high availability, usage and profitability."
"With these solu-
tions, we plan to gain market shares and generate long-term competitive and attractive margins."
"ESG, DECARBONIZATION AND INTEGRITY 
ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) refers to the basic principles of doing business sustainably."
"The 
Group’s stakeholders (e.g."
"investors, employees, customers and non-government organizations) have high 
expectations of the Company’s ESG performance, including in areas such as decarbonization, circular economy 
and integrity, and also of its conduct as an employer and as part of society."
"The Group’s ESG performance 
therefore directly affects its market capitalization, cost of capital and investing activities."
"We aim for a top 
position relative to our competitors in sustainability ratings."
"We are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement 
and align our own activities with the 1.5-degree target."
We aim to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050.
"By 
2030, we have also set ourselves the target of reducing CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light com-
mercial vehicles over the total life cycle by 30% compared with 2018."
"As part of this effort, we are looking for 
ways to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources used in the product emergence process and the 
proportion of recyclable materials in our vehicles."
"We also wish to be perceived as a benchmark for ethical 
corporate conduct."
Volkswagen sees itself as an equal opportunities employer.
"The intention is therefore for at 
least a fifth of Group management positions to be held by women by 2025, and for at least a quarter to be held 
by international managers."
"BUSINESS MODEL 2.0 
The Business Model 2.0 base initiative is developing a Group-wide portfolio of services, the purpose of which is 
to create a seamless and innovative product experience to connect brands, customers, dealerships, our partners 
and whole markets."
"The aim is for the key technologies needed for this to be integrated into a majority of the 
platform-based vehicles by 2030."
"Using connected vehicles, the Group’s brands are to be able in future to remain 
in contact with their customers throughout the entire vehicle life cycle and thus to offer them services and 
functions for their individual needs."
"This will allow us to build a competitive, data-driven service portfolio that 
also maintains our strong position in the automotive market in future."
"NORTH AMERICA (NAR) REGION 
For the Volkswagen Group, the North America region, and particularly the USA, has great growth potential, 
especially where e-mobility is concerned."
"We intend North America to become our third core region alongside 
Europe and China by 2030."
"Our aim there is to achieve a very strong increase in total market share for the Volks-
wagen Group by then."
"We aspire to further expand our presence in the region with strong brands and prepare ourselves for the 
future with market-specific products."
"97 
Goals and Strategies
Group Management Report 
We also wish to participate to a disproportionately high extent in the growth of the increasingly electrified 
markets in the USA and Canada."
"We will therefore substantially expand our range of all-electric models across 
the Group and develop models specifically for these markets."
"With our new vehicle brand Scout, we intend to 
address the core segments of the North American electric vehicle market with tailor-made products."
"The pro-
portion of battery-electric vehicles in our sales in the USA and Canada is to increase to 55% by 2030."
"In addition, we wish to maximize the potential for synergies in the region and build more expertise, industrial 
capacity and vertical value chains in the North America region."
"CHINA REGION 
China is of major strategic significance to the Volkswagen Group as its largest single market."
"All key measures 
are therefore brought together in this strategic base initiative in order to continue Volkswagen’s success story in 
China."
"Our aim for 2030 is to take a leading role in China as an international mobility provider and manufacturer of 
fully connected vehicles."
"As part of our localization strategy (in China for China), we therefore want to pool and 
expand our local development capacity to a greater extent in the coming years."
"In so doing, we want to con-
siderably speed up the development of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and be in a position to offer tailor-
made products to our Chinese customers faster."
"In the market for vehicles with conventional drive systems, we 
want to further strengthen our share of the market with new vehicles and secure it for the long term, as these 
vehicles’ high unit sales will also make a corresponding contribution to profitability in future."
"GROUP STEERING MODEL 
To achieve the objectives of the Group strategy and thereby safeguard the Volkswagen Group’s long-term 
success, we are extensively optimizing our Group Steering Model."
"It is essential that we establish a consistently 
high level of mechanisms that facilitate swift decision-making, the development and use of platform tech-
nologies and the exploitation of synergies, and that we constantly enhance these."
"The updated Group Steering 
Model places the brand groups and technology platforms center stage in order to scale up the latter while 
maximizing synergies across the entire Group product portfolio."
"A new strategy and product planning process 
that has been optimized for efficiency is being developed on the basis of this approach."
"The package of mea-
sures for this initiative hones the definition of roles and responsibilities in the Group and improves transparency 
in this respect both inside and outside the Company."
"It also promotes the entrepreneurship of the independent 
units and brands and at the same time strengthens collaboration across the Group."
"PEOPLE & TRANSFORMATION 
As it becomes a global tech company, the Volkswagen Group will see the biggest transformation of its workforce 
in its corporate history."
"To ensure the Group remains competitive in future, we need to attract top talent and 
support existing employees by providing extensive training where required."
"Our aim is to retain staff for the long 
term."
"It is therefore fundamental that we address the changing needs of our employees and offer them an out-
standing employee experience."
"To achieve our Group’s ambitious objectives, we must also create and promote 
an environment for productive teams, resulting in a strong, sustainable and socially responsible corporate 
culture that fosters a sense of belonging and loyalty to the Company."
"A further focus is on aligning the Company 
with society and the environment."
"98

FINANCING THE TRANSFORMATION 
The transformation being driven by digitalization and electrification will require extensive investment."
"To meet 
this need for financing, the “Financing the Transformation” base initiative aims to leverage even more Group-
wide synergies across all functional areas along the value chain, focusing on costs and efficiency."
"The Group has 
therefore set itself the objective of lasting improvements to its fixed-cost structure, plant productivity, procure-
ment costs, distribution expenses and working capital management."

Internal Management System and Key Performance Indicators
Group Management Report 
The Volkswagen Group’s performance and success are expressed in both financial and nonfinancial key perfor-
mance indicators."
"In the following, we first describe the internal management process and then explain the Volkswagen Group’s 
most significant performance indicators, known as the core performance indicators."
"INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
Consistent, close integration of the Group and brand strategies with the operational planning process ensures 
transparency at the Volkswagen Group when it comes to the financial assessment and evaluation of strategic 
decisions."
"The operational medium-term planning that is conducted once a year and generally covers a period of 
five years is incorporated into the strategic planning as a key management element of the Group."
"Medium-term planning forms the core of our operational planning and is used to formulate and safeguard the 
requirements for realizing strategic projects designed to meet Group targets in both technical and economic terms 
– and particularly in relation to earnings, cash flow and liquidity effects."
"In addition, this planning also serves as a 
basis to coordinate all business areas with respect to the strategic action areas concerned, namely functions/pro-
cesses, products and markets."
"The first year of the 
medium-term planning period is fixed and a budget drawn up for the individual months."
"This is planned in detail 
down to the level of the operating cost centers."
The budget is reviewed each month to establish the target achievement level.
"Key internal management 
instruments comprise target/actual comparisons, prior-year comparisons, variance analyses and, where neces-
sary, action plans to ensure targets are met."
"For the current fiscal year, detailed revolving monthly forecasts are 
prepared for the coming three months and the full year, taking into account the current risks and opportunities."
"Internal Management System and 
Key Performance Indicators 
This chapter describes how the Volkswagen Group is managed and the key performance 
indicators used for this purpose."
"In addition to financial measures, our management system 
also contains nonfinancial key performance indicators."
"100 
Internal Management System and Key Performance Indicators
Group Management Report 
The focus of intrayear internal management is therefore on adapting ongoing activities."
"The current forecast 
serves as the starting point for the subsequent medium-term and budget planning."
"CORE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
As part of our new leadership model, we have adjusted the core performance indicators in the Volkswagen 
Group."
"This figure reflects the popularity of our products and is the measure we use to determine our 
competitive position in the various markets."
"Deliveries are closely related to our goal of transforming the 
Volkswagen Group into one of the world’s leading providers of sustainable mobility."
"Demand for our products and mobility services 
guarantees not only unit sales and production, but also full utilization of our sites and the jobs of our employees."
"The goals we are striving for cannot be achieved without a skilled, flexible and dedicated workforce along with a 
consensus on shared values."
"Sales revenue, which does not include the figures for our equity-accounted Chinese joint ventures, reflects 
our market success in financial terms."
"Following adjustment for our use of resources, the operating result reflects 
the Company’s actual business activity and documents the economic success of our core business."
"The oper-
ating return on sales is the ratio of the operating result to sales revenue."
"The automotive investment ratio indicates the ratio of investment to sales revenue and is calculated by 
adding the research and development ratio (R&D ratio) and the capex to sales revenue ratio."
"The research and 
development ratio in the Automotive Division shows total research and development costs in relation to sales 
revenue."
"Research and development costs comprise a range of expenses, from futurology to the development of 
our marketable products."
"Particular emphasis is placed on the environmentally friendly orientation and digi-
talization of our product portfolio, the expansion of our battery expertise, the development of software and new 
platforms and the creation of new technologies."
"The R&D ratio reflects the activities we have undertaken to 
safeguard the Company’s future viability."
"The ratio of capex (investments in property, plant and equipment, 
investment property and intangible assets, excluding capitalized development costs) to sales revenue in the 
Automotive Division reflects both our innovative power and our future competitiveness."
"101 
Internal Management System and Key Performance Indicators
Group Management Report 
Net cash flow in the Automotive Division represents the excess funds from operating activities available for 
dividend payments, for example."
"It is calculated as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from 
investing activities attributable to operating activities."
"Net liquidity in the Automotive Division is the total of cash, cash equivalents, securities, time deposits and 
loans not financed by third-party borrowings."
"To safeguard our business activities, we have formulated the 
strategic target that net liquidity in the Automotive Division should amount to approximately 10% of the consoli-
dated sales revenue."
"If the return on investment (ROI) 
exceeds the market cost of capital, the value of the Company has increased."
"This is how we measure the finan-
cial success of our brands, locations and vehicle projects."
"In our Financing the Transformation base initiative, we stepped up our activities to optimize net cash flow."
"To 
achieve the strategic goals, performance programs have also been launched Group-wide in an effort to increase 
efficiency and boost earnings."

"The Super-
visory Board appoints, monitors and advises the Board of Management; it is consulted directly on decisions that 
are of fundamental significance for the Company."

Group Management Report 
The Commercial Vehicles Business Area primarily comprises the development, production and sale of trucks and 
buses, the corresponding genuine parts business and related services."
"The commercial vehicles portfolio ranges 
from light vans to heavy trucks and buses."
"The collaboration between the commercial vehicle brands is coordi-

"With its brands, the Volkswagen Group is present in all of the markets around the world that are relevant for 
the Group."
"The key sales markets currently include Western Europe, China, the USA, Brazil, Türkiye, Mexico, 
Poland and Czech Republic."
"Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen Group are managed by the Volkswagen AG Board of Management in 
accordance with the Volkswagen AG Articles of Association and the rules of procedure for Volkswagen AG’s 
Board of Management issued by the Supervisory Board."
"Accordingly, responsibilities in the Board of Management are currently divided among ten Board functions."
The Chair of the Board of Management is also responsible for the “Sport Luxury brand group” Board function.
"Directly attached to the Board are a number of Group Management functions that act as an extension to the 
Board functions."
"These comprise the “Group Sales”, “Group Production”, “Group Procurement” and “Group Research 
and Development” functions."
"The allocation of responsibilities on the Board of Management is based on the rules of procedure decided by 
the Supervisory Board."
"The way this is structured helps the Board of Management to focus on key tasks such as 
strategy, central decisions on the Company’s direction, capital allocation and financial requirements."
"The task of 
the extended board-level management functions is to leverage synergies in the Group and to connect the brands 
and divisions."
"Board of Management committees exist at Group level for the following areas: products, technologies, invest-
ments, digital transformation, integrity and compliance, risk management, human resources and management 
issues."
"In addition to the responsible members of the Board of Management, the relevant central departments 
and the relevant functions of the divisions are also represented on the committees."
"We are continually revising 
and optimizing these and other top management committees in the Group in order to verify that they still align 
with our corporate strategy and to further increase the efficiency of their decision making."
"This reduces com-
plexity and reinforces governance within the Group."
"As part of the “Group Steering Model” base initiative from the NEW AUTO Group strategy, a new leadership 
model for the Group was presented at the Capital Markets Day in June 2023 that will sharpen the focus on 
customer orientation, entrepreneurship and team spirit."
"It follows the “value over volume” principle, prioritizing 
sustainable value creation over volume growth."
"As part of this, the brand groups will receive a new steering 
model."
"In addition, the brand positioning and the product range are to be sharpened."
"The realignment also 
included a renaming of the brand groups: Volume has become Core, Premium is now called Progressive, Sport & 
Luxury has been changed to Sport Luxury, and Truck & Bus to Trucks."
"The Core brand group comprises the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Škoda, SEAT/CUPRA and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands."
"The Progres-
sive brand group comprises the Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati brands."
"The Sport Luxury brand group 
consists of the Porsche brand."

has been listed on the stock market since the end of September 2022."
"In the Trucks brand group, TRATON SE 
acts as the umbrella for the Scania, MAN, Volkswagen Truck & Bus and Navistar commercial vehicles brands."
TRATON SE is also a listed company.
"The structures and product processes at the 
software subsidiary CARIAD will be optimized further."
"We are convinced that our corporate structure, which efficiently connects not only the brand groups but also 
the technology platforms, will enable us to make better use of existing expertise and economies of scale, 
leverage synergies more systematically and accelerate decision making."
"Clear responsibilities and a high degree 
of business responsibility in the brand groups and technology platforms will enable comprehensive imple-
mentation of the Group’s NEW AUTO strategy."
"Each brand within the Volkswagen Group is managed by a brand board of management, which is responsible 
for the brand's independent and self-contained development and business operations."
"To the extent permitted 
by law, the board adheres to the Group targets and requirements laid down by the Board of Management of 
Volkswagen AG, as well as with the agreements in the brand groups."
"This allows Group-wide interests to be 
pursued, while at the same time safeguarding and reinforcing each brand’s specific characteristics."
"Matters that 
are of importance to the Group as a whole are submitted to the Volkswagen AG Board of Management to be 
agreed upon, to the extent permitted by law."
"The rights and obligations of the statutory bodies of the relevant 
brand company thereby remain unaffected."
The Volkswagen Group companies are managed solely by their respective managements.
"The management of 
each individual company takes into account not only the interest of its own company but also the interests of the 
Group, the relevant brand group and the individual brands in accordance with the framework laid down by law."
"With the registration of the transaction, also in May 2023, 
ownership of the shares in Volkswagen Group Rus was transferred from the seller to the buyer."

"MATERIAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL 
FOLLOWING A TAKEOVER BID 
At the end of fiscal year 2019, a banking syndicate granted Volkswagen AG a syndicated line of credit amounting 
to €10.0 billion, which currently runs until December 2026."
"With the line of credit, the syndicate members were 
granted the right to call their portion of the syndicated line of credit in the two forms of a change of control 
described below."
"Firstly, a call right exists if one individual or several individuals acting jointly, who as of the date 
of this agreement exercise control over the Company, have legal or economic ownership of shares that together 
make up more than 90% of the voting rights of the Company."
"Secondly, a call right also exists if one individual or 
several individuals acting jointly, who as of the date of this agreement do not exercise control over the Company, 
obtain control over the Company."
"Such a call right does not exist, however, if one shareholder or several share-
holders of Porsche Automobil Holding SE or one or several legal entities from the Porsche or Piëch family directly 
or indirectly obtain control over the Company."
Volkswagen AG and the Ford Motor Company entered into a Master Collaboration Agreement in January 2019.
"This agreement sets out a framework of obligations, which are to apply to the further cooperation agreements 
entered into between the parties, including those entered into in fiscal year 2021."
"It also covers the Development 
Agreement concluded in January 2019 for the development of the next-generation Amarok."
"The Master Collab-
oration Agreement provides for a right of termination with immediate effect in the event of a change of control."
"A 
change of control has been defined to mean a change affecting more than 50% of the voting capital of one of the 
companies or a change in the ability to directly or indirectly control the management of a company through its 
decision-making bodies."
"The right of termination must be exercised within 90 days of the company becoming 
aware of a change of control."
"Russia itself, in its 
role as an energy exporter, restricted gas deliveries to Europe."
"The resulting shortage of supply led particularly in 
2022 to rising prices on energy and commodity markets."
"While prices dropped in the reporting year as a result of 
weakening momentum in the global economy, they remain at a relatively high level in some cases."
"Furthermore, 
salary trends in the overheated labor markets, among other factors, pose the threat of continued high inflation."
"The slowdown in economic 
momentum versus the previous year was mainly due to weaker growth in the advanced economies, whereas the 
overall rate of change in the emerging markets increased somewhat."
"On the other hand, the extent to which national economies were affected 
by the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict was a decisive factor."
"Prices for energy and many other raw 
materials were lower than in the previous year, and shortages of intermediate products and commodities eased 
somewhat."
Global trade in goods expressed in nominal terms decreased in the reporting year.
"Europe/Other Markets 
The economy in Western Europe recorded positive, yet low overall growth of +0.4 (+3.5)% in 2023."
"This trend 
was seen in many countries in Northern and Southern Europe."
"The main reasons for this were the momentary 
and in some cases significant increases in energy and commodity prices, which had substantially pushed up 
inflation rates in the previous year and thus had a negative impact on consumer confidence."
"Business sentiment 
also deteriorated on average across all sectors."
"In addition, the restrictive monetary policy measures taken to 
rein in inflation impacted both consumer spending and investment."
"Business Development 
The world economy recorded positive growth in fiscal year 2023."
"Global demand  
for vehicles was noticeably higher than in the previous year."
"Amid a challenging market  
environment, the Volkswagen Group delivered 9.2 million vehicles to customers."
"110 
Business Development
Group Management Report 
 
The economies in Central and Eastern Europe recorded real growth in absolute gross domestic product (GDP) of 
+2.6 (+1.1)% in the reporting year."
"While economic output in Central Europe saw positive, albeit less dynamic 
growth of +1.7 (+4.5)%, GDP in the Eastern Europe region rose again in 2023 compared with the prior year for the 
first time since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with a growth rate of +3.6 (–2.8)%."
"Inflation rates 
across the entire Central and Eastern Europe region declined on average in the reporting year, but remained at a 
high level."
"In Türkiye, economic output for the year 2023 as a whole rose by +3.8 (+5.3)% amid very high inflation and a 
fall in the value of the local currency."
"South Africa saw slight GDP growth of +0.6 (+1.9)% in the reporting year, 
amid persistent structural deficits and political challenges."
"Germany  
Germany’s economic output recorded a negative growth rate of –0.2 (+1.9)% in the reporting year."
"Compared 
with the prior year, the seasonally adjusted unemployment figures rose on average."
"After reaching historically 
high levels in 2022, monthly inflation rates fell on average over the year, but remained relatively high."
"North America 
US economic output grew by +2.4 (+1.9)% in the reporting year."
"In view of high inflation and the tight labor 
market, the US Federal Reserve maintained its restrictive monetary policy and raised its key interest rate four 
times over the course of the reporting year."
Unemployment remained at a low level in the reporting year.
"GDP 
rose by +1.1 (+3.8)% in neighboring Canada and by +3.3 (+3.9)% in Mexico."
"South America 
Brazil’s economy posted GDP growth of +3.0 (+3.1)% in 2023."
"Argentina registered a negative economic per-
formance with a year-on-year decline in GDP of –1.7 (+5.0)% amid very high inflation and continued depreciation 
of the local currency."
"India registered 
strong growth of +6.9 (+7.3)%."
Japan recorded positive growth of +1.9 (+0.9)% year-on-year.
"TRENDS IN THE MARKETS FOR PASSENGER CARS AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES 
In fiscal year 2023, the volume of the passenger car market worldwide was noticeably higher than in the prior 
year at 76.6 million vehicles."
"Most markets registered growth, which together with weak prior-year figures was 
attributable to the fact that shortages and disruption in global supply chains eased restricting vehicle availability 
to a lesser extent."
"While the supply situation for intermediates improved compared with 2022, the trend in new 
registrations in individual markets dampened at the end of the previous year, partly as a consequence of the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict and pull-forward effects generated by state subsidies expiring."
"Significant or strong growth was recorded in the overall markets of the Western Europe, Central and Eastern 
Europe, Middle East and North America regions."
"The markets of the South America region were slightly higher 
and the markets of the Asia-Pacific region noticeably higher than the prior-year level."
"The market in Africa fell 
slightly short of the prior-year volume."
"In the reporting year, the global volume of new registrations for light commercial vehicles was on a level with 
the previous year (–0.2%)."
"Sector-specific environment 
Along with fiscal policy measures, the sector-specific environment was considerably affected by the economic 
situation, which contributed to the mixed trends in unit sales in the markets in the fiscal year now ended."
"While 
real purchasing power fell in many places and vehicle prices stagnated at a high level, it was possible to reduce 
the backlog of orders on a large scale due to increased vehicle availability worldwide."
"The fiscal policy measures 
included tax cuts or increases, the introduction, expiry and adjustment of incentive programs and sales incen-
tives, as well as import duties."
"In addition, non-tariff trade barriers to protect the respective domestic automotive 
industries made the movement of vehicles, parts and components more difficult."
"The performance of the large 
individual passenger car markets was consistently positive in fiscal year 2023: France (+16.1%), the United 
Kingdom (+17.9%), Italy (+18.8%) and Spain (+15.8%) significantly exceeded their respective prior-year levels."
"The volume of new registrations for light commercial vehicles in Western Europe was significantly higher 
than in the previous year, increasing by 16.3%."
"The passenger car market volume in the Central and Eastern Europe region increased strongly by 23.6% in

"In South Africa, financed vehicle purchases remained at a comparatively low level due to the subdued eco-
nomic conditions, higher vehicle prices and increased energy prices."

raise interest rates again."

"Deliveries of the MAN TGE van series saw a strong 
increase compared with the prior-year period, rising to 26,627 (+23.4%) vehicles."
"Due to the very high order 
backlog, a further stabilization of supply chains and higher production volume, the deliveries increased signifi-
cantly in the reporting year."
"In the 27 EU states excluding Malta, but including the United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland (EU27+3) 
sales in the reporting year were up by 34.8% on the same period of the previous year and amounted to a total of

DELIVERIES IN THE POWER ENGINEERING SEGMENT 
Orders in the Power Engineering segment are usually part of major investment projects."
"Lead times typically 
range from just under one year to several years, and partial deliveries as construction progresses are common."
"Accordingly, there is a time lag between incoming orders and sales revenue from the new construction business."
"In 2023, sales revenue in the Power Engineering segment was largely driven by Engines & Marine Systems 
and Turbomachinery, which together generated more than three quarters of overall sales revenue."
"ORDERS RECEIVED IN THE PASSENGER CARS SEGMENT IN WESTERN EUROPE  
Orders received in Western Europe in the reporting year were down 15.7% on the 2022 level."
"Demand for models 
with combustion engine or plug-in hybrid drivetrains performed somewhat better by comparison – in some 
markets such as the United Kingdom and Spain, orders increased year-on-year."
"For battery-electric vehicles by 
contrast, there was a stronger decrease in orders for battery-electric vehicles than in the prior year."
"The buyer 
reluctance seen across the industry, partly due to worsening underlying economic conditions and the expiry of 
state subsidies, contributed to lower demand in key markets."
"ORDERS RECEIVED FOR COMMERCIAL VEHICLES 
Orders received for mid-sized and heavy trucks, for buses and for commercial vehicles from the MAN TGE van 
series declined by 21% year-on-year to 264,798 vehicles in 2023."
"Prevailing uncertainty about economic 
development and more difficult financing conditions led to a normalization of demand, particularly in Europe."
"In 
North America, incoming orders were down sharply on the previous year, due mainly to continuing restrictive 
order acceptance caused by the very high order backlog."
"Incoming orders in South America were strongly below 
the prior-year figure as a result of pull-forward effects in connection with the introduction of a new emissions 
standard in Brazil at the beginning of 2023."
"The MAN TGE van series segment likewise recorded a significant 
downturn."
Order intake in the bus business recorded a noticeable decrease year-on-year.
"A noticeably higher order 
intake was recorded in the EU27+3 region."
"This is attributable, among other things, to the continued slow 
recovery in the coach market."
"In contrast, incoming orders in South America were sharply below the previous 
year’s figures."
"ORDERS RECEIVED IN THE POWER ENGINEERING SEGMENT 
The long-term performance of the Power Engineering business is determined by the macroeconomic environ-
ment."
"Individual major orders lead to fluctuations in incoming orders during the year that do not correlate with 
these long-term trends."
Orders received in the Power Engineering segment in 2023 amounted to €5.0 (4.3) billion.
"Engines & Marine 
Systems and Turbomachinery generated more than three quarters of the order volume in a persistently difficult 
market environment."
"In the marine business, for example, twelve 32/44CR engines and twenty-four 175D engines were ordered 
for six ships in 2023."
"In the power plant business, orders were secured for 81 engines and component sets for 22 
completely knocked down engines of different types with an aggregate output of 1,409 MW."
"For turbomachinery, 
we received several orders for new applications which were driven by the energy transition and decarbonization 
such as carbon capture and storage in the Netherlands and a large-scale heat pump for Denmark."
"A further order 
was also placed for compression of hydrogen from electrolysis installations for use in industrial processes."
"We 
also recorded successes for remote-controlled machinery trains in the North Sea equipped with digital packages 
and a major order for eleven compressors on a floating oil and gas production facility."

Group Management Report 
VOLKSWAGEN GROUP FINANCIAL SERVICES 
The activities in the Financial Services Division cover the Volkswagen Group’s dealer and customer financing, 
leasing, banking and insurance activities, fleet management and mobility services."
"The division comprises 
Volkswagen Financial Services and the financial services activities of Scania, Navistar and Porsche Holding 
Salzburg and also extends to the contracts concluded by our international joint ventures."
The Financial Services Division’s products and services were popular in fiscal year 2023.
"However, limited 
vehicle availability caused by parts supply shortages and disruptions in logistics chains weighed on demand."
"The number of new financing, leasing, service and insurance contracts signed worldwide increased by 11.3% to 
9.5 million."
"The ratio of leased and financed vehicles to Group deliveries (penetration rate) in the Financial Ser-
vices Division’s markets stood at 32.8% in the reporting year, on a level with the previous year."
"The total number 
of contracts stood at 24.6 (24.5) million on December 31, 2023."
"At 6.9 million, the number of new contracts signed was up 12.0% on the previous year’s figure in the Europe/ 
Other Markets region even though the financial services business was impacted by limited vehicle availability in 
2023."
"The total number of contracts at the end of the reporting year was 18.4 (18.1) million, putting it on  
a level with the figure for December 31, 2022."
"The customer financing/leasing area was responsible for 
7.1 (7.2) million of these contracts."
The number of new contracts signed in North America in 2023 increased to 1.0 (0.8) million.
"At 2.9 (3.0) mil-
lion, the number of contracts as of December 31, 2023 was on a level with the end of the previous year."
"The 
customer financing/leasing area recorded 1.6 (1.7) million contracts."
"In the South America region, 543 (360) thousand new contracts were concluded in the reporting year."
"Compared with December 31, 2022, the total number of contracts at the end of the reporting year rose to 
933 (828) thousand."
Existing contracts mainly related to the customer financing/leasing area.
"The number of new contracts signed in the Asia-Pacific region in 2023 declined to 1.0 (1.2) million, falling 
short of the comparative prior-year figure."
"At the end of December 2023, the total number of contracts stood at 
2.4 (2.6) million."
The customer financing/leasing area was responsible for 1.5 (1.6) million of these contracts.
"SALES TO THE DEALER ORGANIZATION 
The Volkswagen Group’s unit sales to the dealer organization increased in the reporting year by 10.4% to 
9,362,441 units (including the equity-accounted companies in China)."
"The prior-year figure had been impacted 
in particular by the limited vehicle availability due to bottlenecks in the supply of parts caused by the shortage of 
semiconductors and the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
"Persistent parts supply shortages had a negative effect in the 
reporting year and disruption in the global logistics chains also led to delays, though these eased as the year 
progressed."
"Unit sales outside Germany rose by 9.5% to 8,184,399 vehicles."
"Growth was seen above all in the 
United States, the United Kingdom and Türkiye, while fewer vehicles were sold in China."
"Unit sales in Germany 
increased by 17.2% year-on-year."
"The proportion of the Group’s total unit sales attributable to Germany 
increased to 12.6 (11.9)%."
"The Tiguan, Polo, Passat, Jetta, T-Roc, Golf and T-Cross from the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand were our 
biggest sellers last year."
"The largest increases in unit sales were recorded for the Polo, ID.3, Jetta and Passat 
models from the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand, the Q4 e-tron, A6 and Q5 from Audi, the SEAT Leon and the 
Škoda  Octavia."
The Porsche 911 and the ID.
Buzz also achieved a strong growth rate.
Parts supply shortages impacted production in fiscal year 2023.
"Production in Germany 
increased by 16.2% to 1,914,368 vehicles."
"The proportion of the Group’s total production accounted for by 
Germany increased to 20.6 (18.9)%."
"INVENTORIES 
Global inventories of new vehicles at Group companies and in the dealer organization were higher at the end of 
the reporting year than at year-end 2022."
"The effect of disruption in the logistics chains continued to have a 
negative impact in the reporting year which eased as the year progressed."
"EMPLOYEES 
Including the Chinese joint ventures, the Volkswagen Group employed an average of 678,825 people in fiscal 
year 2023, an increase of 1.4% year-on-year."
"In Germany, we employed 296,134 people on average; at 
43.6 (43.3)%, their share of the total headcount was on a level with the previous year."
"The number of active employees in the Volkswagen Group rose by 1.2% to 654,359 as of December 31, 2023."
"In addition, 12,585 employees were in the passive phase of their partial retirement and 17,081 young people 
were in vocational traineeships."
"At the end of the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group had a total of 684,025 
employees worldwide."
This represented an increase of 1.2% since the end of 2022.
"The workforce in Germany 
rose to 298,687 people (+1.6%) and the workforce outside Germany – including the sale of OOO Volkswagen 
Group Rus, Kaluga/Russia – increased to 385,338 (+0.9%)."
"Over time, however, hopes 
that national central banks would ease back on the pace of interest rate increases changed to growing concerns 
about further hikes to rein in persistently high inflation."
"What is more, the crisis in the international banking 
sector triggered by the higher interest rates deeply unsettled the financial markets, a situation that was exacer-
bated among other things by the debt ceiling debates in the United States."
"Encouraging economic and corporate 
data initially bolstered the stock markets as the year progressed, before prices came under pressure again."
"By the 
end of the reporting year, prices had recovered once more in anticipation of interest rate cuts in the year 2024."
"The German stock market index (DAX) got off to a tremendous start in 2023, initially recording significant 
gains over the 2022 year-end closing price."
"Sentiment brightened on the back of falling energy prices, expec-
tations of declining inflation rates and improved leading economic indicators."
"However, in the months that 
followed, stock prices were hit by continued interest rate hikes on the part of the European Central Bank in light 
of continued high inflationary pressure."
The DAX transitioned into sideways movement.
"As the year went on, the 
turbulence at several international banks triggered by rising interest rates and the US debt ceiling dispute had an 
adverse effect on share prices."
"This was compounded by economic woes caused among other things by the 
muted economic data coming from China."
"Supported by receding inflation and speculation about interest rate 
cuts, market sentiment improved in the last trading weeks of the reporting year, with the DAX rising to a new 
record high in mid-December and ending 2023 up 20.3% on the previous year’s level."
"The prices of Volkswagen AG’s preferred and ordinary shares initially developed very positively at the 
beginning of the reporting year."
"The sound results for the 2022 fiscal year published at the beginning of March 
2023, the dividend proposed for 2022 and a favorable outlook for 2023 caused a temporary rally."
"The investment 
plans announced when the annual report was presented were received critically by the capital markets due to 
the high level of capital required for the transformation of the company."
"The intensifying competition in the auto-
motive sector likewise acted as a damper on the share price."
"Price cuts by competitors, especially for electric 
vehicles, and concerns about increasingly aggressive pricing generated further uncertainty among investors."
"Declining market shares in China combined with the assessment by market participants regarding the Group’s 
high dependence on developments in this country also weighed on the share price."
"126

initially pushed down prices further."
"Buoyed by a positive overall market environment, the shares then regained 
some ground before stabilizing at a low level in the last trading weeks of the year."
"The 2023 year-end closing 
price was down 4.0% for the preferred share and 19.8% for the ordinary share compared with the prior-year 
figure."
"Assuming that the regular dividend (before deduction of taxes) was reinvested in Volkswagen shares at 
the time of distribution, the total return on the preferred shares was +3.1% and the total return on the ordinary 
shares was –15.1%."
"The return on the preferred shares was therefore lower than that of the benchmark indices, 
DAX and EURO STOXX Automobiles & Parts."

"Its core element is a new leadership model based on customer orien-
tation, entrepreneurship and team spirit."
"The “value over volume” principle thereby prioritizes sustainable value 
creation over volume growth."
"The shift in focus will give the brand groups a new steering model and sharpen brand 
positioning and the product range."
"Responsibility for return targets has been transferred to the brands, which 
will each implement an earnings improvement program to shore up profitability and cash flows and reduce 
capital intensity."
"The Group will reposition the “Architecture”, “Software”, “Battery, Charging & Energy” and 
“Volkswagen Group Mobility” technology platforms so that their economies of scale can be leveraged for the 
strengthened brands."
"Regionally, the Group is focusing its investments on the world’s most attractive profit 
pools."
"In this context, the refined strategies for the important growth markets of China and North America were 
also presented."
"In addition, Volkswagen has updated its medium-term and strategic financial targets."
"Along with 
the presentations and discussions with the members of the Group Board of Management, visitors to the Capital 
Markets Day had the chance to experience the Group’s vehicles and technologies for themselves."
"The Volks-
wagen Group also gave the general public the opportunity to follow the event online via a live webcast, with 
some 16,000 internal and external viewers watching the presentations live."
Capital Markets Day was the start of deeper dialogue with the capital markets.
"Further events are planned for 
the coming years at which investors and analysts will be briefed in detail on the strategies for the brand groups, 
technology areas and regional strategies."
"DIVIDEND POLICY 
Our dividend policy matches our financial strategy."
"In the interests of all stakeholders, we aim for continuous 
dividend growth that allows our shareholders to participate appropriately in our business success."
"The proposed 
dividend therefore reflects our financial management objectives – in particular, ensuring a solid financial founda-
tion as part of the implementation of our strategy."
"The current dividend proposal can be found in the chapter entitled “Volkswagen AG (condensed, in accor-
dance with the German Commercial Code)” of this annual report."
"The Board of Management and Supervisory 
Board of Volkswagen AG are proposing a dividend of €9.00 per ordinary share and €9.06 per preferred share for 
fiscal year 2023."
"On this basis, the total dividend amounts to €4.5 (4.4) billion."
"The payout ratio is based on the 
Group’s earnings after tax attributable to Volkswagen AG shareholders."
"This amounts to 28.3% for the reporting 
year and stood at 29.4% for the previous year; the special dividend due to the IPO of Porsche AG is not included 
in either of these figures."
We strive to achieve a payout ratio of at least 30%.
"DIVIDEND YIELD 
Based on the dividend proposal for the reporting year, the dividend yield on Volkswagen ordinary shares is 
7.6 (5.9)%, measured by the closing price on the last trading day in 2023."
"The dividend yield on preferred shares 
is 8.1 (7.5)%."

REFINANCING  
The Volkswagen Group further diversified its refinancing activities in 2023 and carried out several successful 
transactions in the international capital markets amid a challenging market environment."
"With the growing electrification of the vehicle portfolio, sustainable financial instruments are an increasing 
focus of the refinancing strategy."
"In March 2023, Volkswagen International Finance N.V."
"placed two green bonds 
with a total volume of €1.75 billion."
"In August 2023, the company successfully issued its first green hybrid notes 
with a total principal amount of €1.75 billion after duly calling a hybrid note with a principal amount of €750 mil-
lion to be redeemed as of September 4, 2023."
"These green bonds are based on the Volkswagen Group’s Green 
Finance Framework presented in November 2022."
"This allows the Company to refinance capital expenditures 
that are aligned with the EU Taxonomy, whereby Volkswagen will limit itself to all-electric vehicles."
"Volkswagen 
Financial Services AG also published its first Green Finance Framework in August 2023, which is to be used exclu-
sively for refinancing financial products for all-electric vehicles."
"In September 2023, Volkswagen Leasing GmbH 
placed its first green bonds on the capital market with a total volume of €2.0 billion."
"In the US capital market, Volkswagen Group of America Finance, LLC placed bonds with a total volume of

"In May and November 2023, TRATON Finance Luxembourg S.A., an indirect subsidiary of TRATON SE, issued 
bonds in three tranches with a total volume of €1.75 billion."
"As well as the green bonds, official euro benchmark bonds were issued for a further €2.0 billion for the Finan-
cial Services Division."
Securities were also issued in various currencies and regions.
"Alongside the placement of senior, unsecured bonds, asset-backed securities (ABS) transactions were another 
element of our refinancing activities."
"In Europe, public ABS transactions with a total volume of €2.75 billion were 
placed."
"Public ABS transactions were also issued in the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan and Brazil."
"The Volkswagen Group was also actively involved in the commercial paper market with several issuing com-
panies."
"The proportion of fixed-rate instruments in the past year was about 2.5 times as high as the proportion of 
floating-rate instruments."
"In our refinancing arrangements, we generally aim to exclude interest rate and currency risk as far as possible 
with the simultaneous use of derivatives."

IFRS 17 – INSURANCE CONTRACTS 
IFRS 17 specifies new accounting rules for insurance contracts."
"First-time application resulted in an insignificant 
change in equity as of January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2022, respectively."
"This is due primarily to the changed 
system for calculating provisions related to the insurance business."
"In addition, netting cash flows when mea-
suring the provisions also led to a reduction of €0.7 billion each in assets and provisions related to the insurance 
business as of January 1, 2023."
"The change in the system for recognizing income and expenses has no material 
effect on the income statement."
Prior-year figures have been adjusted accordingly.

XPeng Inc., Cayman Islands, (XPeng) at a purchase price totaling USD 706 million."
"The realization of a forward 
purchase transaction dating from July 26, 2023 resulted in a non-cash gain of €74.2 million in fiscal year 2023, 
which is recognized in the other financial result."
"Along with the agreement to acquire the shares, a technological 
framework agreement was signed with Guangdong Xiaopeng Motors Technology Co."
"Ltd., Guangzhou/China, a 
subsidiary of XPeng, for the joint development of electric vehicles in China, among other things."
"The equity 
investment in XPeng is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"Both investments are classified as debt instruments in the financial statements and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"The measurement resulted in non-cash gains of €0.7 million in 
fiscal year 2023, which are recognized in the other financial result."
"To promote the development of highly automated and autonomous driving in China, Volkswagen has also 
agreed the establishment of a joint venture with Horizon Robotics."
"On December 14, 2023, Volkswagen invested 
an amount of CNY 2 billion to this end in exchange for an interest of 60% in the new company, CARIZON (Beijing) 
Technology Company Limited, Beijing/China (CARIZON)."
"In addition, Volkswagen has undertaken to make future 
capital contributions of up to CNY 8.4 billion to the joint venture."
"On registration of the transaction on May 22, 2023, ownership of 
the shares in Volkswagen Group Rus was transferred from the seller to the buyer."
"In this context, the Volkswagen Group had already made significant impairments in fiscal year 2022 and 
recognized appropriate provisions."
The selling price amounted to €0.1 billion.
"The deconsolidation of the 
affected companies resulted in a loss of €0.4 billion in fiscal year 2023, which is reported in the other operating 
result."
"This result is split between the Automotive Division (€–0.4 billion) and the Financial Services Division 
(€0.1 billion)."
"The loss is mainly attributable to the realization of currency translation effects of €–0.3 billion, 
which have been reclassified from the currency translation reserve to other operating expenses."
"SPECIAL ITEMS 
Special items consist of certain items in the financial statements whose separate disclosure the Board of Man-
agement believes can enable a better assessment of our economic performance."
No material special items in connection with the diesel issue were recognized in fiscal year 2023.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Results of operations of the Group 
In the period from January to December 2023, the Volkswagen Group’s sales revenue amounted to €322.3 bil-
lion, up 15.5% on the prior-year figure."
"This was mainly attributable to a rise in volume and beneficial changes in 
the price positioning and in the mix."
These factors were offset by exchange rate effects.
"The prior-year period 
had been impacted to an even greater extent by limited vehicle availability due to parts supply shortages."
"The 
Volkswagen Group generated 81.5 (82.6)% of its sales revenue abroad."
"Gross profit increased by €8.8 billion to 
€61.0 billion."
The gross margin was 18.9 (18.7)%.
"In fiscal year 2023, the Volkswagen Group’s operating result of €22.6 (22.1) billion was on a level with the 
previous year."
The operating return on sales was 7.0 (7.9)%.
"In particular, higher vehicle sales and improved price 
positioning were set against a rise in product costs (in particular for commodities)."
"The deconsolidation of Volkswagen Group Rus and its subsidiaries led to a loss of 
€0.4 billion in 2023."
"In the previous year, the result had been impacted mainly by expenses relating to loss 
allowances and risk provisions due to the direct impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and special items in 
connection with the diesel issue."
The financial result increased by €0.7 billion to €0.6 billion.
"The share of the 
result of equity-accounted investments was slightly below that of the prior year."
"In the interest result, higher 
interest income was not sufficient to offset the rise in interest expenses resulting primarily from changes in the 
interest rates used to measure provisions."
"The other financial result was affected in the reporting year among 
other things by adverse exchange rate effects, especially as a result of the sharp depreciation of the Argentinian 
peso."
"This was set against lower non-cash expenses from adjustments to the carrying amounts of investees 
because of changes in share prices and impairment tests, and against positive net income from securities and 
funds."
"In the prior-year period, the impairment loss recognized on the equity investment in Argo AI and changes 
in share prices affecting net income from securities and funds, particularly as a result of the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict, had both had a negative impact."
The Volkswagen Group’s earnings before tax were up €1.1 billion to €23.2 billion in fiscal year 2023.
"The return 
on sales before tax declined to 7.2 (7.9)%."
"Income taxes resulted in an expense of €5.3 (6.2) billion, which in turn 
led to a tax rate of 22.7 (28.2)%."
"Earnings after tax were noticeably up on the previous year, at €17.9 (15.9) billion."
"Higher vehicle 
sales together with improvements in the price positioning and in the mix offset adverse exchange rate effects."
"In 
the prior-year period, the adverse impact had by parts supply shortages had been even stronger."
"Sales revenue 
in the Passenger Cars, Commercial Vehicles and Power Engineering Business Areas was significantly up on the 
respective prior-year values."
"As our Chinese joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, the Group’s 
business performance in the Chinese passenger car market is essentially reflected in the Group’s sales revenue 
only through deliveries of vehicles and vehicle parts."
"The ratio of cost of sales to sales revenue declined 
in the reporting year."
"Since research and development costs and sales revenue increased by similar percentages 
in the Automotive Division in the reporting year, their ratio to each other – the research and development ratio 
(R&D ratio) – was on a level with 2022 at 8.1 (8.1)%."
"The automotive investment ratio, which combines the R&D 
and capex ratios, amounted to 13.5 (13.6)% in fiscal year 2023."
"In the period from January to December 2023, there was a year-on-year increase in distribution expenses due 
to factors such as higher logistics costs, as well as in administrative expenses; their respective share of sales 
revenue went down."
The other operating result stood at €–4.1 (1.5) billion.
"Fiscal year 2023 was weighed down 
by adverse effects from the fair value measurement of derivatives to which hedge accounting is not applied, 
especially for commodities."
These factors had had a positive impact in the prior-year period.
"In the period from January to December 2023, the Automotive Division’s operating result amounted to 
€18.8 billion, up €2.3 billion on the previous year."
"The rise is primarily attributable to a rise in vehicle sales and 
improvements in the price positioning."
"Effects from the measurement of derivatives to which hedge accounting 
is not applied, higher product costs, in particular for commodities, and negative exchange rate trends weighed 
on the operating result."
"The prior-year period had been marked by positive effects from the fair value mea-
surement of derivatives to which hedge accounting is not applied and by expenses in connection with the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict."
The operating return on sales stood at 7.0 (7.1)%.
"Results of operations in the Financial Services Division 
In the period from January to December 2023, the Financial Services Division’s sales revenue amounted to 
€54.1 billion, an increase of 16.0% over the prior-year figure."
"Compared with the previous year, cost of sales 
increased faster than sales revenue, driven in particular by a very strong rise in interest expenses and higher 
depreciation of the residual values of leased vehicles."
"As a result, gross profit went down by €1.5 billion to 
€7.9 billion."
The Financial Services Division’s operating result of €3.8 (5.6) billion was down on the previous year.
"The 
decline was mainly the result of higher interest expenses."
"In addition, derivatives, which had had a beneficial 
effect in the previous year, had a negative impact in the reporting year."
"The prior year had been weighed down 
especially by expenses relating to loss allowances as a direct impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
"The oper-
ating return on sales decreased to 7.0 (12.1)%."
The return on equity before tax was 8.8 (14.1)%.
"Principles and goals of financial management 
Financial management in the Volkswagen Group covers liquidity management, the management of currency, 
interest rate and commodity price risks, and credit and country risk management."
"It is performed centrally for all 
Group companies by Group Treasury, based on internal guidelines and risk parameters."
"Some functions of the 
MAN Energy Solutions, Porsche AG, Porsche Holding Salzburg and TRATON GROUP subgroups and of the 
Financial Services Division are included in the financial management and, in addition, have their own financial 
management structures."
"The goal of financial management is to ensure that the Volkswagen Group remains solvent at all times and, at 
the same time, to generate an adequate return from the investment of surplus funds."
"We use a liquidity pooling 
system to optimize the use of existing liquidity between the significant companies."
"Among other features of this 
system, the balances, either positive or negative, accumulating in cash pooling accounts are swept daily into a 
regional target account and thus pooled."
"In the management of credit and country risk, diversification is used 
to limit the Volkswagen Group’s exposure to the so-called counterparty risk."
"To achieve this, counterparty risk 
management imposes internal limits on the volume of business allowed per counterparty when financial 
transactions are entered into."
Various credit rating criteria are applied in this process.
"These focus primarily on 
the capital resources of potential counterparties, as well as the ratings awarded by independent agencies."
"The 
relevant risk limits and the authorized financial instruments, hedging methods and hedging horizons are 
approved by the Group Board of Management Committee for Risk Management."
"For additional information on 
the principles and goals of financial management, please refer to the chapter on “Financial risk management and 
financial instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."

FINANCIAL POSITION 
Financial position of the Group 
In the period from January to December 2023, the Volkswagen Group recorded gross cash flow of €48.5 (49.3) 
billion."
"The non-cash measurement effects in connection with hedging transactions, which are included in 
earnings, must be eliminated from the cash flow statement."
"Cash outflows of around €1.5 billion for tax pay-
ments relating to prior assessment periods had an adverse impact."
"The change in working capital amounted to 
€–29.1 (–20.8) billion, driven primarily by a higher increase in receivables and lease assets and a smaller rise in 
liabilities compared to the prior year."
"A smaller increase in inventories and higher other provisions had an 
offsetting effect."
Cash outflows resulting from the diesel issue were lower than in 2022.
"Cash flows from oper-
ating activities went down by €9.1 billion to €19.4 billion in fiscal year 2023."
"The Volkswagen Group’s investing activities attributable to operating activities grew by €2.6 billion to 
€28.0 billion in the reporting year, mainly as a result of higher investments in capex and additions to capitalized 
development costs."
"In the previous year, this item had included the full portion of the purchase price payable by 
Volkswagen for the acquisition of Europcar, which was contributed to Green Mobility Holding and amounted to 
€1.7 billion."
The Volkswagen Group’s financing activities produced a cash inflow of €16.0 (4.2) billion.
"Financing activities 
primarily include the issuance and redemption of bonds as well as changes in other financial liabilities."
"This also 
included the issuance of green hybrid notes with a total nominal value of €1.75 billion, which were successfully 
placed in August 2023."
"The redemption of the hybrid note of €0.75 billion called as of September 2023 reduced 
cash flows from financing activities accordingly."
"At the end of December 2023, the Volkswagen Group reported cash and cash 
equivalents of €43.5 (29.7) billion in its cash flow statement."
"At the end of fiscal year 2023, the Volkswagen Group’s net liquidity stood at €–147.4 billion, compared with 
€–125.8 billion on December 31, 2022."
"Financial position of the Automotive Division 
In the reporting year, the Automotive Division’s gross cash flow was €35.8 billion, an earnings-related rise of 
€2.6 billion compared with the previous year."
"The non-cash measurement effects in connection with hedging 
transactions, which are included in earnings, must be eliminated from the cash flow statement."
"Cash outflows of 
around €1.5 billion for tax payments relating to prior assessment periods had an adverse impact."
"The change in 
working capital amounted to €2.1 (–3.3) billion."
"The year-on-year change was primarily attributable to a smaller 
rise in inventories and higher other provisions."
"These effects were set against a smaller increase in liabilities than 
in the previous year."
"As a consequence, cash flows from operating activities in an amount of €37.9 billion were 
26.7% higher than in the previous year."
"In the period from January to December 2023, investing activities attributable to operating activities 
amounting to €27.2 (25.1) billion were up on the prior-year figure."
"Within this figure, investments in property, 
plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets, excluding capitalized development costs 
(capex) increased by €1.6 billion to €14.4 billion."
The ratio of capex to sales revenue was 5.4 (5.5)%.

"7 The total of cash, cash equivalents, securities and time deposits, as well as loans to affiliates and joint ventures net of third-party borrowings (noncurrent and current financial 
liabilities)."
"A considerable portion of capex was above all allocated to our production facilities and to models that we 
launched in 2023 or are planning to launch in 2024."
"They relate to both new vehicles to expand our model range 
and product upgrades for established models."
"Other investment priorities include the electrification and digi-
talization of our products, technologies of the future and enhancements to the modular and all-electric toolkits 
and platforms."
"Additions to capitalized development costs rose by €1.4 billion to €11.1 billion in the reporting 
year."
"The “Acquisition and disposal of equity investments” item amounted to €–2.1 (–3.0) billion; it included pri-
marily strategic investments in a variety of companies, in particular XPeng."
"In the previous year, this had included 
the full portion of the purchase price payable by Volkswagen for the acquisition of Europcar, which was con-
tributed to Green Mobility Holding and amounted to €1.7 billion."
The Automotive Division’s investing activities also include the convertible loan granted to Horizon Robotics.
"In the period from January to December 2023, the Automotive Division’s net cash flow of €10.7 billion was 
€5.9 billion up on the prior-year figure."
"The cash conversion rate, which is the ratio of the Automotive Division’s 
net cash flow to operating result, stood at 57.0 (29.2)% at the end of 2023."
"In fiscal year 2023, the Automotive Division’s financing activities led to a cash outflow of €12.9 billion, com-
pared with a cash inflow of €8.6 billion in the previous year."
"A cash inflow was generated in fiscal year 2023 by the green hybrid notes with a 
total nominal value of €1.75 billion that were successfully placed via Volkswagen International Finance N.V."
"These notes comprise a €1.0 billion note with a coupon of 7.5%, which is noncallable for five years,

and a €0.75 billion note with a coupon of 7.875%, which is noncallable for nine years."
"Both notes are perpetual 
and increase net liquidity and equity by the nominal amount less transaction and other costs."
"Financing activities 
also include the issuance and redemption of bonds and changes in other financial liabilities."
"Despite the cash outflows due to the special dividend in connection with Porsche AG’s IPO, the Automotive 
Division’s net liquidity was robust, at €40.3 billion, on December 31, 2023, compared with €43.0 billion at the 
end of 2022."
"The Automotive Division’s net liquidity as a proportion of consolidated sales revenue decreased to 
12.5 (15.4)% in the reporting year, mainly because sales revenue rose faster than net liquidity."
"Financial position in the Financial Services Division 
In fiscal year 2023, the Financial Services Division recorded a gross cash flow of €12.7 billion, down €3.4 billion 
on the prior-year figure for reasons such as lower earnings."
"The change in working capital amounted to €–31.2  
(–17.5) billion."
"Higher growth in lease assets and receivables and a rise in inventories led to a higher level of funds 
tied up in working capital than in the previous year."
This was offset by a larger increase in liabilities.
"Conse-
quently, cash flows from operating activities decreased by €17.1 billion to €–18.5 billion."
Investing activities attributable to operating activities amounted to €0.9 (0.4) billion.
"The Financial Services Division’s financing activities generated a cash inflow of €28.9 billion in the reporting 
year."
This figure relates primarily to the issuance and redemption of bonds and to other financial liabilities.
"In the 
prior-year period, there had been a cash outflow of €4.4 billion."
"On December 31, 2023, the Financial Services Division’s negative net liquidity, which is common in the 
industry, was €–187.7 billion as against €–168.8 billion at the end of 2022."
"Total assets as of the reporting date reflected the implementation of the new guidance on accounting 
for insurance contracts (IFRS 17), which led to a decrease in total assets and liabilities."
"A corresponding retro-
spective adjustment was made to the 2022 year-end figure."
"Equity was up by €11.6 billion to €189.9 billion, 
mainly because of the encouraging earnings."
"The equity ratio of 31.6 (31.6)% was on a level with the figure 
recorded at the end of the previous year."
"On December 31, 2023, the Group had off-balance-sheet commitments in the form of contingent liabilities in 
the amount of €10.4 (10.6) billion and in the form of financial guarantees in the amount of €0.9 (1.2) billion."
"In 
addition, there were other financial obligations of €38.2 (35.4) billion."
"The contingent liabilities relate primarily to 
legal risks in connection with the diesel issue, as well as to potential liabilities from tax risks in the Commercial 
Vehicles Business Area in Brazil."
"Other financial obligations primarily result from purchase commitments for 
property, plant and equipment and services, irrevocable credit commitments to customers and from develop-
ment and supply contracts."
"In addition to the other financial obligations, there are purchase commitments for 
inventories with a short turnover period, which arise primarily from the Master Collaboration Agreement with 
Ford Motor Company for the joint development of vans and mid-sized pickups for the global market."
"Moreover, 
there are long-term purchase obligations under battery purchase agreements with Northvolt Group companies."
"Automotive Division balance sheet structure 
The noticeable increase in the Automotive Division’s intangible assets at the end of 2023 as against Decem-
ber 31, 2022 was driven in particular by a rise in capitalized development costs."
"Property, plant and equipment 
was up slightly, with investments in property, plant and equipment set against lower depreciation."
"Equity-
accounted investments declined for reasons that included dividend resolutions as well as impairment losses as a 
result of changes in share prices and in response to impairment tests."
"The intragroup reclassification of the 
equity investment in Europcar, which is held via Green Mobility Holding, to the Financial Services Division also 
contributed to this downturn."
"Noncurrent other receivables and financial assets decreased, due mainly to a 
decline in positive effects from the measurement of derivatives compared to year-end 2022."
"Total noncurrent 
assets amounted to €186.0 (178.7) billion, driven by higher volumes."
"Current assets stood at €120.2 (122.7) billion on December 31, 2023, down from the prior-year figure."
"Current other receivables and financial assets went up, buoyed primarily by the volume-related rise in trade 
receivables."
"Total securities were down €10.7 billion to €22.2 billion, while cash and cash equivalents in the 
Automotive Division increased by €5.7 billion to €28.7 billion at the end of December 2023."

At €146.3 billion, the Automotive Division’s equity on December 31, 2023 was 7.6% higher than at the end 
of 2022."
"The main contributing factors were encouraging earnings in the reporting year and the green hybrid 
notes issued in August 2023."
"Noncontrolling interests, which increased noticeably, were mostly attributable to the noncontrolling 
interest shareholders of the Porsche AG Group and of the TRATON Group."
"The equity ratio climbed to 
47.8 (45.1)%."
"Noncurrent liabilities were on a level with the previous year, amounting to €86.9 (88.3) billion at the end of 
the reporting year."
"The noncurrent financial liabilities included in this item decreased, mainly because of reclas-
sifications from noncurrent to current liabilities reflecting shorter remaining maturities."
"Pension provisions 
increased, driven primarily by actuarial remeasurement following a change in the discount rate."
"At €73.1 (77.1) billion, current liabilities on December 31, 2023 were also down on the previous year."
"Current 
financial liabilities amounted to €–8.6 (–11.0) billion."
"The figures for the Automotive Division also contain the 
elimination of intragroup transactions between the Automotive and Financial Services divisions."
"As the current 
financial liabilities for the primary Automotive Division were lower than the loans granted to the Financial 
Services Division, a negative amount was disclosed in both periods."
"Current other liabilities were down, primarily 
because of the special dividend, which was resolved in connection with the IPO of Porsche AG in Decem-
ber 2022 and distributed in January 2023."
"This was offset by the netting of the right to payment from Porsche SE 
arising from the second tranche of the ordinary shares of Porsche AG."

spective adjustment was made to the previous year-end figure."
Noncurrent assets grew to €174.7 (161.2) billion.

the prior-year period."
Current assets climbed by 17.8% to €119.4 billion.
"The current other receivables and financial assets included

RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI) AND VALUE CONTRIBUTION  
The central focus of the Volkswagen Group’s financial target system is to continuously and sustainably increase 
the value of the Company."
The return on investment serves as a constant target in strategic and operational management.
"If the return 
on investment exceeds the market cost of capital, there is an increase in the value of the invested capital and a 
positive value contribution."
"The concept of value-based management makes it possible to assess the success of 
the Automotive Division and individual business units."
"It also enables the earning power of our products, product 
lines and projects – such as new plants – to be measured."
"Components of value contribution 
Value contribution is calculated on the basis of the operating result after tax and the opportunity cost of invested 
capital."
"The operating result shows the economic performance of the Automotive Division and is initially a pre-tax 
figure."
"Based on our companies’ income tax rates, which vary from country to country, we assume an overall 
average tax rate of 30% when calculating the operating result after tax."
The cost of capital is multiplied by the average invested capital to give the opportunity cost of capital.
"Invested capital is calculated as total operating assets reported in the balance sheet (property, plant and 
equipment, intangible assets, lease assets, inventories and receivables) less non-interest-bearing liabilities 
(trade payables and payments on account received)."
"Average invested capital is derived from the balance at the 
beginning and the end of the reporting year."
"As the concept of value-based management only comprises our operating activities, assets relating to 
investments in subsidiaries and associates and the investment of cash funds are not included when calculating 
invested capital."
Interest charged on these assets is reported in the financial result.

Determining the current cost of capital 
The cost of capital is the weighted average of the required rates of return on equity and debt."
The cost of equity is determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
"This model uses the yield on 
long-term risk-free Bunds, increased by the risk premium attaching to investments in the equity market."
"The risk 
premium comprises a general market risk and a specific business risk."
"The general risk premium of 7.5% reflects 
the general risk of a capital investment in the equity market."
"The specific business risk – price fluctuations in 
Volkswagen preferred shares – is modeled in comparison to the MSCI World Index when calculating the beta 
factor."
The MSCI World Index is a global capital market benchmark for investors.
"The analysis period for the beta factor calculation spans five years with annual beta figures calculated on a 
weekly basis followed by the subsequent calculation of the average."
"A beta factor of 1.13 (1.15) was determined 
for 2023."
The cost of debt is based on the average yield for long-term corporate bonds.
"As borrowing costs are tax-
deductible, the cost of debt is adjusted to account for the tax rate of 30%."
"A weighting on the basis of a fixed ratio for the fair values of equity and debt results in an effective cost of 
capital for the Automotive Division of 8.5 (8.3) % for 2023."
"Higher vehicle sales and improved price positioning were set against a rise in product costs (in 
particular for commodities)."
"In addition, the fair value measurement of derivatives to which hedge accounting  
is not applied (especially commodity hedges) had a negative effect on the operating result in the reporting year 
(€–3.2 billion), in contrast to the prior-year period, when it had boosted earnings by €1.8 billion."
"The effect of 
purchase price allocation on earnings and assets is not taken into account as this cannot be influenced by man-
agement in the course of business operations."
"At €123,887 (117,402) million, invested capital increased noticeably in the reporting year compared with the 
prior year."
"The return on investment (ROI) is the return on invested capital for a particular period based on the 
operating result after tax."
"Due to the improved operating result, the ROI of 12.3 (12.0)% exceeded both the prior-
year figure and our minimum required rate of return on invested capital of 9%."
"At €10,491 (9,701) million, the opportunity cost of capital – invested capital multiplied by the cost of capital – 
was noticeably up on the previous year."
"Improvements in the operating result after tax, net of the opportunity 
cost of invested capital, led to a positive value contribution of €4,727 (4,379) million."
"More information on value-based management is contained in our publication entitled “Financial Control 
System of the Volkswagen Group”, which can be downloaded from our Investor Relations website: www.volks-

2 Prior-year figures adjusted (see disclosures on IFRS 17).
"In the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group’s business was impacted by the challenging global market environ-
ment, parts supply shortages and disruptions in the logistics chain."
"In this environment, we delivered 9.2 million 
vehicles to customers in the past fiscal year, which was within the corridor we last forecast."
Group sales revenue increased by 15.5% and was thus at the upper end of the expected corridor.
"At €22.6 billion, the operating result was in the range of our adjusted forecast and thus level with the prior-
year figure before special items."
"Research and development costs reflect our activities undertaken to safeguard the Company’s future via-
bility."
The R&D ratio in the Automotive Division was in the range of our adjusted expectations at 8.1%.
The ratio of capex to sales revenue for the Automotive Division was below the forecast corridor at 5.4%.
"Net cash flow of €10.7 billion was more than double the prior-year level and thus higher than our adjusted 
forecast."
"Above all, a stronger-than-expected reduction in inventories also had a positive effect at the end of the 
reporting year."
"On December 31, 2023, net liquidity had reached a solid level of €40.3 billion, which was at the upper end of 
our expected range."
"The return on investment (ROI) in the Automotive Division was 12.3%, which was within the forecast corridor 
and, as expected, thus exceeded our minimum required rate of return on invested capital."

ANNUAL RESULT 
No material special items in connection with the diesel issue were recognized in fiscal year 2023."
"In the fiscal year under review, the Russia-Ukraine conflict negatively affected Volkswagen AG in an amount 
of €0.1 billion (previous year: approximately €1 billion)."
"This arose from the loss on the disposal of the shares in 
OOO Volkswagen Group Rus, Kaluga, which was reported in the financial result."
"Sales increased by 16.3% year-on-year to €92.4 billion in 2023, driven particularly by higher sales volumes 
and a more favorable price-product mix."
Sales generated abroad accounted for a share of €53.6 billion or 58.0%.
"Cost of sales increased by 9.1% to €86.7 billion due to higher vehicle sales in the reporting year, among other 
reasons."
Gross profit on sales rose accordingly to €5.7 (–0.0) billion.

(CONDENSED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE) 
Fiscal year 2023 was impacted by the challenging global market environment and the 
transformation of the industry."

Volkswagen AG
Group Management Report 
The net other operating result amounted to €0.1 billion in the reporting year, down €1.9 billion on the previous 
year."
"This decline was driven in particular by negative measurement effects and the profit or loss from the settle-
ment of hedging transactions that was less positive than in the prior year."
"A reassessment and extension of the useful lives of certain items of property, plant and equipment gave rise 
to a positive effect on profit or loss of around €0.4 billion in the 2023 reporting year."
"The financial result fell by €7.7 billion to €9.1 billion, mainly because of lower income from profit transfers."
"In 
the previous year, this item had included income of €13.2 billion from profit transferred by Porsche Holding 
Stuttgart GmbH, Stuttgart, in connection with the IPO of Porsche AG."
Taxes on income amounted to €-1.1 (1.0) billion.
"The higher tax expenses in the reporting year were due 
mainly to foreign withholding tax and to tax expenses for prior years."
Net income for fiscal year 2023 amounted to €6.2 (12.5) billion.
"NET ASSETS AND FINANCIAL POSITION 
Total assets amounted to €197.8 billion on December 31, 2023, down €27.5 billion on the comparative 2022 
figure."
"Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were up by €0.6 billion because investments 
exceeded depreciation and amortization charges."
"Financial assets rose to €145.5 (138.9) billion as a result of a 
number of capital increases."

wagen AG paid contributions of €3.8 billion to the capital reserves of Volkswagen Financial Services AG, Braun-
schweig, in the reporting year."
"To finance the capital requirements of CARIAD SE, Wolfsburg, Volkswagen AG 
paid contributions of €1.5 billion to the capital reserves of Porsche Siebte Vermögensverwaltung GmbH, Wolfs-

Current assets (including prepaid expenses) amounted to €42.1 (76.7) billion as of December 31, 2023."
"Inven-
tories were down by €1.0 billion to €6.8 billion."
"In addition to the decrease in raw materials, consumables and 
supplies, which is largely attributable to a reduction in precious metals due to volume and price effects, finished 
goods and purchased merchandise in particular fell as transport capacity returned to normal levels."
"Receivables 
and other assets declined to €28.3 (59.8) billion."
"Their decrease is attributable to lower receivables from loans 
and receivables from profit transfers from subsidiaries and a decline in time deposits with maturities of more than 
three months without call right."
"Cash instruments were down, driven particularly by the decrease in restricted 
short-term time deposits at the reporting date."
Equity at the end of the reporting year was €42.2 (40.3) billion.
The equity ratio was 21.3 (17.9)%.
"Other provisions decreased by €0.5 billion to €17.1 (17.7) billion, due mainly to the reduction in provisions for 
litigation risks and other provisions."
"Provisions for pensions fell by €0.7 billion to €24.6 billion, particularly as a 
result of a change in measurement inputs, and provisions for taxes decreased by €0.9 billion to €2.5 billion."
"The €27.2 billion decrease in liabilities, including deferred income, to €111.4 billion was mainly the result of 
lower loan liabilities to affiliated companies and the liabilities for the special dividend in connection with the IPO 
of Porsche AG, Stuttgart, included in the prior-year figure."
"Volkswagen AG’s cash funds, comprising cash instruments with a maturity of less than three months, less 
bank liabilities repayable on demand and cash pooling liabilities, deteriorated year-on-year from €–1.2 billion to  
€–4.4 billion."
The interest-bearing portion of debt amounted to €92.3 (107.7) billion.
"In our assessment, given 
the context created by political and economic developments in 2023 and the transformation of the industry, the 
economic position of Volkswagen AG is challenging, but just as positive overall as that of the Volkswagen Group."
"DIVIDEND POLICY 
Our dividend policy matches our financial strategy."
"In the interests of all stakeholders, we aim for continuous 
dividend growth that allows our shareholders to participate appropriately in our business success."
"The proposed 
dividend therefore reflects our financial management objectives – in particular, ensuring a solid financial foun-
dation as part of the implementation of our strategy."
"In our Group strategy, we have set ourselves the goal of achieving a payout ratio of at least 30%."
"The payout 
ratio is based on the Group’s earnings after tax attributable to Volkswagen AG shareholders."
"This amounts to 
28.3% for the reporting year and stood at 29.4% in the previous year."
"SPECIAL DIVIDEND FOLLOWING PORSCHE AG IPO 
The resolution of the extraordinary General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on December 16, 2022 gave rise to the 
obligation to pay a special dividend and led to a total obligation to the shareholders of Volkswagen AG amounting 
to €9.6 billion."
"The cash outflow was slated for January 9, 2023 and occurred on that day."
"DIVIDEND PROPOSAL 
In fiscal year 2023, net retained profits amounted to €4.5 billion."
"The Board of Management and Supervisory 
Board are proposing to pay a total dividend of €4.5 billion, i.e."
"€9.00 per ordinary share and €9.06 per preferred 
share."
"The prior year had been 
impacted in particular by the limited vehicle availability due to parts supply shortages caused by the shortage of 
semiconductors and the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
"Persistent parts supply shortages had a negative effect in the 
reporting year and disruption in the logistics chains also led to delays, though these eased as the year pro-
gressed."
Vehicles sold abroad accounted for a share of 64.1 (64.1)%.
"PRODUCTION 
Volkswagen AG manufactured a total of 816,016 vehicles (+22%) in the reporting year at its vehicle production 
plants in Wolfsburg, Hanover and Emden."
Parts supply shortages restricted production in fiscal year 2023.

Sustainable Value Enhancement
Group Management Report 
The main financial performance indicators for the Volkswagen Group are described in the “Results of Operations, 
Financial Position and Net Assets” chapter."
"Nonfinancial key performance indicators also provide information on 
the efficiency of our Company’s value drivers."
"These include the processes in the areas of research and devel-
opment, procurement, technology, production, marketing and sales, human resources, information technology 
and quality assurance."
"In all of these processes, we are aware of our responsibility towards our customers, our 
employees, the environment and society."
"In this chapter we provide examples of how we want to increase the 
value of our Company in a sustainable way."
"SUSTAINABILITY 
Sustainability means maintaining intact environmental, social and economic systems with long-term viability at 
a global, regional and local level."
"The Volkswagen Group can influence these systems in various ways, and actively 
takes responsibility to make a contribution to their sustainability."
"We have thus developed a sustainable style of 
company management and put in place the necessary management structures."
"We have also anchored our goal to sustainably shape mobility for present and future generations in our Group 
strategy NEW AUTO."
"Especially the Group’s “ESG, Decarbonization and Integrity” base initiative will drive this 
topic further."
The materiality process is used to identify and evaluate the most important sustainability issues for the Group.
"Based on the business model of Volkswagen AG and its social impacts, the focus is on key ESG requirements, 
stakeholder expectations and adherence to legal regulations and internationally established reporting 
standards."
The Company conducted a materiality analysis in 2022.
"In reviewing potentially material issues, we con-
sidered both external and internal company perspectives."
"As a result of this process, the focus areas of decar-
bonization, circular economy, supply chain and human rights, people & transformation, diversity, and integrity 
were classified as material by the Group Sustainability Steering Committee."
"The focus topics identified were 
reviewed in 2023, taking into account the requirements of the Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (LkSG – 
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act) and changes in the material ESG ratings."
"As a result of this, the six 
focus areas were reconfirmed."
"They cover most of the requirements formulated in the ESG ratings for assess-
ment criteria applied."
"Wherever this is already possible, each focus area is linked to clear goals and milestones, 
KPIs and appropriate packages of measures."
"ESG-related KPIs such as the decarbonization index and the 
diversity index are already today reflected in the remuneration of members of the Board of Management."
"Sustainable Value Enhancement 
Our goal is to run our business responsibly along the entire value chain."
"Everyone should 
benefit from this – our customers, our employees, the environment and society."
"Even in our 
Group strategy “NEW AUTO – Mobility for generations to come”, we aim to make mobility 
sustainable for present and future generations."
"158 
Sustainable Value Enhancement
Group Management Report 
Decarbonization 
The decarbonization of the Group and in particular its portfolio of products is a major part of the NEW AUTO 
Group strategy, where it has been defined as one of the focus areas in the base initiative."
"In this index, the use phase is calculated over 
200,000 km and with reference to region-specific fleet values without statutory flexibilities."
"The CO2e intensity 
of the charging current of the electric vehicles is also calculated based on region-specific electricity mixes."
"Our 
vehicle life cycle assessments, which are used as the data basis for calculating supply chain and recycling 
emissions, have been verified externally and independently in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044."
"The 
DKI gives us an informative measuring tool that makes our progress and interim results public and verifiable."
"The DKI calculation methodology is regularly adapted according to internal and external requirements, such 
as new test cycles for fleet emissions."
"Published DKI values can therefore also be adjusted to the new method-
ology and thus changed to facilitate the presentation of a time series that is methodologically consistent."
"The 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol requires the recalculation of corporate emissions in the event of material new infor-
mation or if changes occur."
"There may be various reasons to remeasure previous years’ emissions to enable a fair 
comparison with current emissions."
"These may include structural changes in the Company, for example."
"At the 
Volkswagen Group, changes to the calculation are decided on annually in a set process."
"Based on these deci-
sions, we are currently working on recalculating historical emissions for the base years used in the current 
climate protection targets and on having these audited."
"By 2030, the DKI is to be reduced by 30% compared with the base year 2018, and emissions offsetting will 
not be included in the figure."
"In the reporting year, the DKI value averaged 47.3 t CO2e/vehicle."
"This represents a 
reduction of 0.5 t CO2e/vehicle compared with the figure adjusted for 2022 due to a change in the assumption 
on which the calculation is based, for example the first-time inclusion of region-specific life cycle assessments 
for Chinese models."
"Circular economy 
The finite nature of natural resources and the social and environmental consequences of mining raw materials 
make decoupling economic growth from resource consumption and the development of a circular economy key 
sustainability topics."
"Policymakers at both international and national level have addressed these challenges and 
made it their mission to regulate markets more aggressively in the future in an effort to speed up the trans-
formation towards resource efficiency and a circular economy."
"Another important driver of the circular economy 
is the progress in decarbonization at the Volkswagen Group."
"The growing use of secondary materials and estab-
lishment of closed material cycles can help to further reduce our CO2 emissions."
"Recognizing the importance of 
the topic, Volkswagen anchored the topic of circular economy in the NEW AUTO Group strategy through its “ESG, 
Decarbonization and Integrity” base initiative."
"The Volkswagen Group created and implemented concepts for the reconditioning and recycling of vehicle 
components from an early stage."
"These concepts are being constantly refined and are also adapted to the 
requirements of e-mobility."
"To intensify our efforts for a transition to a loop-oriented and resource-conserving 
approach to doing business, we have pooled expertise within the Group and are working on projects and 
measures on a cross-brand basis."
We are stepping up efforts to use recyclable materials in our vehicle projects.
"These currently include raw 
materials from production residues as well as renewable raw materials or natural fibers such as flax, cotton, 
wood and cellulose, provided they comply with all the technical requirements."
"In the future, the use of raw 
materials from end-of-life vehicles will be increasingly taken into account."
"159 
Sustainable Value Enhancement
Group Management Report 
To preserve recyclable materials from electric vehicles, Volkswagen opened the Group’s first pilot facility for 
recycling high-voltage vehicle batteries at the Salzgitter site in early 2021."
"The objective is industrialized 
recovery of valuable raw materials such as lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt."
"More information on the focus areas can be found in the sections on integrity and compliance, procurement, 
production and employees, as well as in our Group Sustainability Report for fiscal year 2023."
"Management and coordination  
The Volkswagen Group has established a Group-wide sustainability management."
"The related structures, pro-
cesses and responsibilities are codified in a specific Group policy."
"We view sustainability management as a 
continuous improvement process."
"Sustainability is part of the Top 10 program at Group 
level and is managed through the strategic management structure of the NEW AUTO strategy."
"The content is 
regularly evaluated and reported to the Board of Management."
"Fund managers 
in the capital markets view membership of the UNGC as an important factor when deciding to invest in shares 
and bonds."
ESG funds have become very popular in recent years and indispensable for stakeholders.
"As part of 
the annual Communication on Progress, the Volkswagen Group and its brands report on their progress in 
implementing the ten UNGC principles and their activities to support the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs)."
"Strategic stakeholder management  
Our stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations who have an influence on or are influenced by the 
course or the result of corporate decisions."
"Our customers and employees are at the center of our stakeholder 
network."
"Based on continuous stakeholder analysis, we have also identified eight more stakeholder groups."
"Some of the Group’s bodies – currently including the Supervisory Board and Works Council – perform an over-
sight and advisory role and also act as interfaces between internal and external stakeholder groups."
"We understand stakeholder management as systematic interaction with key interest and stakeholder groups 
within society on the key topics and objectives of our NEW AUTO Group strategy."
"Our goal is an open, con-
structive and also critical exchange with the stakeholder groups shown in the following chart."
"We aim to pro-
mote implementation of their requirements and expectations and to actively shape central strategic issues."
"After restarting our interaction activities in 2022, we began to restructure our stakeholder management in the 
reporting year with the aim of listening to and integrating the suggestions and recommendations of our stake-
holders even more effectively in future."
"Alongside the traditional forms of interaction, which include surveys and 
regular dialog with our stakeholders, new formats are to be added to create opportunities for interactive and 
transparent discussion of important, strategic and socially relevant sustainability topics."

At Group level, the Sustainability Council has a prominent position."
"This advisory body provides assistance to the 
Volkswagen Group with important, strategic sustainability issues and is made up of internationally renowned 
experts from the academic world, politics and society."
"It establishes its own working methods and areas of focus 
independently, has far-reaching rights for the purposes of exchanging information, consultation and initiating 
action, and consults regularly with the Board of Management, top management and the employee represent-
tatives."
The term of office of the existing members expired at the end of 2022.
"In the reporting year, we began to 
reorganize the strategy and composition of the Sustainability Council."
"Further information is available on the

our social responsibilities toward our stakeholders."
"The main focus of our corporate social engagement activities 
is on supporting future, environmental, educational and community projects at many of our sites across the 
world."
"Environmental Strategy  
As one of the largest automobile manufacturers, Volkswagen takes responsibility for the environmental impact of 
its activities."
"Based on the NEW AUTO Group strategy, we have put greater focus on our environmental targets."
"With our environmental mission statement goTOzero, we aspire to reduce environmental impact along the entire 
life cycle – from raw material extraction until end-of-life – for all our products and mobility solutions in order to 
keep ecosystems intact."
"Compliance with environmental regulations, standards and voluntary commitments is a 
basic prerequisite of our actions."
"We consistently 
focus on the electrification of our products, decarbonization of our entire value chain and expansion of renew-
able energy generation to supply our sites and customers."
"We intend to be a net-carbon-neutral company by 
2050 at the latest."
"> Resources 
We reduce the volumes of primary raw materials needed by using recycled material and renewable raw 
materials."
We maximize our energy and resource efficiency and establish loops for materials and water.
"Together with our business partners we cut down on the amount of natural resources utilized throughout our 
supply chain."
"> Ecosystems 
We reduce harmful emissions in air, soil and water."
"We mitigate the impact of our business operations on bio-
diversity and ecosystems and support projects to conserve these."
"> Environmental compliance 
Where integrity and compliance are concerned, we aim to be a role model for a modern, transparent, successful 
enterprise."
"We use effective environmental compliance management systems to identify and manage environ-
mental risks and opportunities throughout the lifetime of our mobility solutions."
"We conduct open dialog with 
our stakeholders and incorporate their expectations into our decisions."
"Organization of environmental protection  
Volkswagen has created an environmental policy that sets out guidelines for environmental decision-making, for 
the management of projects and for the Group’s environmental stewardship."
"Thus, parameters are set for the 
conduct and working methods of management and staff in five areas: management behavior, compliance, 
environmental protection, collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement."
"The Board of Management of Volkswagen AG is the highest internal decision-making body for environmental 
issues."
"Both it and the brands’ boards of management take not only business, but also social and environmental 
criteria into account when making key company decisions."
"The Group-wide management of environmental 
protection is the responsibility of the Group Steering Committee for the Environment and Energy."
"Other bodies 
take responsibility for steering key individual aspects."
"They include the Group CO₂ Steering Committee and the 
Group Steering Committee for Fleet Compliance."
"The Volkswagen Group coordinates the activities of the brands, which in turn steer the measures in the 
regions."
The brands and companies are responsible for their own environmental organization.
"They base their 
own environmental protection activities on the targets, guidelines and principles that apply throughout the 
Group."
"Achieving compliance with environmental laws and regulations at all of our sites is a top priority for Volks-
wagen."
"Furthermore, we are guided by Company standards and targets."
"We regularly train our employees on 
environmental protection and environmental compliance."
"The intention of our environmental compliance 
management systems is to ensure that environmental aspects and obligations are given appropriate consider-
ation in our business operations."
"Disregard for environmental obligations, fraud and misconduct are treated as a 
severe compliance violation and penalized accordingly."
"Compliance with our Environmental Policy Statement 
and with other Group environmental requirements is evaluated annually and reported to the Board of Man-
agement of Volkswagen AG and the respective brand boards of management."

HOLISTIC INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
Integrity and compliance are major priorities in the Volkswagen Group."
"We firmly believe that, for long-term 
commercial success, it is important that each and every individual complies with laws, regulations and commit-
ments."
Compliant behavior must be a matter of course for all Group employees.
"This is why integrity and compli-
ance remain key elements of our Group's NEW AUTO strategy and a focus topic in matters of sustainability."
"Our objective is to be a role model and deepen the trust of our employees, customers, shareholders and 
partners in our Company."
"Our regulations, processes and corporate culture are designed in such a way that all 
employees are able to act with integrity and comply with the rules at all times."
"As performance indicators, 
integrity and compliance must have the same strategic and operational priority in our Company as sales revenue, 
profit, product quality and employer attractiveness."
"With the Together4Integrity (T4I) program, we have built a holistic integrity and compliance management 
system (ICMS) for all Group and brand companies, which brings together virtually all the Company’s integrity and 
compliance activities under one roof."
"This system was set up in line with the five internationally recognized ECI 
(Ethics and Compliance Initiative) principles: strategy, risk management, a culture of integrity, a speak-up 
environment and resolute accountability."
"The aim of T4I is not only to strengthen uniform corporate governance 
throughout the Group in relation to integrity and compliance, but also to advance the culture of integrity."
"This 
includes steadfastness in adhering to principles of integrity regardless of economic or social pressures."
"T4I and 
the ICMS therefore contribute significantly to increasing sustainability in the Volkswagen Group."
"Implementation 
by 2025 was originally planned."
"Responsibility for continuing to implement the measures and embedding them now lies with the Group brands 
and companies and with the responsible Group departments."
"Focus areas 
Compliance with the rules must be a matter of course for all employees of the Volkswagen Group."
"The Group 
Integrity & Compliance organization provides support with this worldwide in the form of programs, guidelines, 
processes and practical advice."
"It helps the Group and brand companies to comply with the rules when carrying 
out their business activities and to comply with the relevant laws and internal regulations."
"Among other things, 
its work concentrates on anti-corruption and preventing embezzlement, fraud and money laundering."
"The starting point for this is the Internal Compliance Risk Assessment (ICRA), which identifies compliance 
risks in the Group."
"Compliance measures are developed and defined for each controlled company on the basis of 
the risk profiles derived from the ICRA, which the companies have to implement depending on their risk clas-
sification."
"The ICRA also sets standards relating to the Code of Conduct (CoC), the whistleblower system, com-
pliance training and communication."
"HR (Human Resources) Compliance Policies and Procedures 
The aim of this key initiative is the integration of integrity and compliance into the standard HR processes such 
as recruitment, training, promotion and remuneration (bonus payments)."
"Integrity and compliance are also a 
compulsory topic in annual employee appraisals and are a component of the training measures for employees 
across all levels of the Company."

Awareness-raising and Communication 
The Code of Conduct (CoC) forms the basis for integrity and compliance in the Volkswagen Group."
"It serves as 
the main tool for reinforcing awareness of responsible conduct and decision-making and can be used as an aid 
and as a way of finding the right contact persons."
"The CoC is binding for all employees and has been part of 
every employment contract since 2019."
"We and our employees undergo regular mandatory training on its key 
contents."
Events in the departments round off the offerings of the Group Integrity & Compliance organization.
"The com-
munication team regularly examines practical compliance tasks and case studies."
"Awareness-raising on 
compliance topics is supported by information and communication activities such as awareness campaigns, film 
and dialogue formats, newsletters and interactive games."
The Compliance Infopoint has established itself as the central help center.
"The team there answers com-
pliance-related questions, establishes internal guidelines and directives and gives advice on process standards."
"Training Courses and Standards 
With the ICMS, the Group Integrity & Compliance organization sets uniform standards for compliance training 
across the Group."
"This is to enable brands and companies to provide their employees with a consistent quality of 
risk-based and target group-specific training that includes predetermined core content."
"The training courses 
address two key topics: the Code of Conduct and anti-corruption."
"Protection and Prevention: the Whistleblower System 
The whistleblower system is the central point of contact for reporting cases of rule-breaking by Group employ-
ees or by direct and indirect suppliers."
Employees and third parties can report misconduct at any time and in many languages.
"A wide 
range of channels is available for this purpose, and the information can be lodged completely anonymously, if 
preferred."
"The aim is to use binding principles and a clearly governed process to avert damage to the Company 
and its employees."
"M&A and NCS Compliance 
In the event of planned mergers and acquisitions (M&A transactions), we audit the relevant companies for com-
mercial risks such as corruption, breaches of trust or fraud, and for human rights risks."
"This also applies to joint 
ventures and to industrialization and cooperation projects with external partners."
"The analyses provide recom-
mendations for the mitigation of the risks identified."
"The Group Integrity & Compliance organization also 
supports compliance management in non-controlled shareholdings (NCS), i.e."
"companies that are not controlled 
by a Volkswagen Group company as the majority shareholder."
This includes the Chinese joint ventures.
"The aim is to identify these 
risks at an early stage, to avoid such business partners, and to define measures to minimize risk and implement 
these with the business partner."
"If this is not possible, we refrain from entering the business relationship or 
terminate it as the law allows."
"Environmental Compliance 
Statutory environmental regulations and voluntary commitments are binding at all locations and in all business 
fields."
"The Group’s environmental policy and the environmental compliance management system stipulate the 
relevant requirements and responsibilities."
"They apply to all strategy, planning and decision-making processes in 
the Group brands and companies."
"This includes a system of key indicators to determine progress in meeting 
environmental targets in the fields of renewable energy, CO2 emissions and resource efficiency."
"Anti-Corruption 
The Volkswagen Group has a zero-tolerance policy on active or passive corruption."
"This is anchored in both our 
internal Code of Conduct and our Code of Conduct for Business Partners."
"Our investigation offices look into and 
process any reported violations of our principles, and sanctions are imposed on the employees concerned."
"Tackling corruption also includes developing and implementing mandatory training for employees in divisions or 
companies with a high risk exposure."
"For more information on integrity and compliance, as well as the topic of business and human rights, please see 
our 2023 Group Sustainability Report."

Sustainable Value Enhancement
Group Management Report 
 
1 The European Commission switched its calculation of CO2 fleet emissions from NEDC to WLTP in 2021."
2 Subject to confirmation of CO2 data within the scope of official publication by the European Commission.
"RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
Forward-looking mobility solutions with brand-defining products and services would be unthinkable without 
innovation."
"This makes our research and development work essential for sustainably increasing the value of the 
Company."
"Together with our Group brands, we have launched measures based on our NEW AUTO strategy to link 
development activities across the Group."
"At the heart of this is an efficient, cross-brand development alliance 
characterized by a close network of our experts, collaboration on an equal footing, an innovative working 
environment and the pooling of development activities."
"The aim is to make use of synergies across the Group 
and act as a role model for the environment, safety and integrity."
"The development alliance plays a major part in 
driving the Volkswagen Group’s transformation and helping to make it fit for the future."
"CO2 fleet emissions  
We use the strategic indicator of CO2 fleet emissions in Europe and the United States to evaluate the effective-
ness of our measures to reduce CO2 emissions emitted by our vehicles."
"The statutory 
target is 122 g CO2/km (WLTP)1."
The Volkswagen Group thus more than met the EU’s CO2 fleet target.
"All figures 
are subject to confirmation of CO2 data within the scope of official publication by the European Commission."
"The 
targets will be tightened as from 2025: the European Commission has thus set a target of a 15% reduction in CO2 
emissions compared with 2021, which corresponds to a CO2 target of less than 100 g CO2/km for our new pas-
senger car fleet in the EU."
"A reduction of 55% has been defined for 2030, equivalent to a CO2 target of less than 
50 g CO2/km."
"We assume that our new passenger car fleet in the EU will meet the target for 2025 and more than 
meet the target for 2030."
A CO2 reduction target of 100% for passenger cars has been set for 2035.
2 Subject to recognition by EPA and CARB (final MY report MY22 submitted but not yet confirmed).
"The Volkswagen Group’s new light commercial vehicles fleet in the EU emitted an average of 187 g CO2/km 
(WLTP)1 in the reporting year according to the statutory measurement bases."
"The statutory target is 
204 g CO2/km (WLTP)1."
The Volkswagen Group thus more than met the EU’s CO2 fleet target.
"All figures are 
subject to confirmation of CO2 data within the scope of official publication by the European Commission."
"The 
targets will be tightened as from 2025: the European Commission has thus stipulated a 15% reduction of CO2 
emissions compared with 2021, which corresponds to a CO2 target of less than 180 g CO2/km for our new light 
commercial vehicle fleet in the EU."
"A reduction of 50% has been defined for 2030, equivalent to a CO2 target of 
less than 105 g CO2/km."
"We assume that our new light commercial vehicles fleet in the EU will meet this target 
for 2025 and more than meet the target for 2030."
"A CO2 reduction target of 100% for light commercial vehicles 
has been set for 2035."
"In the United Kingdom and Switzerland/Liechtenstein markets, the Volkswagen Group’s 
new passenger car fleet met the statutory requirements for the reporting year."
"The Volkswagen Group’s new light 
commercial vehicle fleet met the statutory requirements for the reporting year in the United Kingdom but fell just 
short of those for Switzerland."
"In the United States, the emission pool – comprising the Group brands Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, 
Lamborghini, Bentley and Porsche – commits to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy (CAFE) regulations."
"Due to a model year – the accounting period used in the USA – differing in length 
from the calendar year, internal calculations are used to determine the figures for the current and preceding 
model year."
"The average GHG CO2 value (internal data as of September 2023) for the passenger car and light 
commercial vehicle fleets in model year 2023 is 133 g CO2/km (model year 2022: 142 g CO2/km)."
"The statutory 
target is 122 g CO2/km (model year 2022: 136 g CO2/km)."
"Compliance with the statutory requirements of the 
GHG and CAFE regulations together with externally acquired credits enabled the Volkswagen Group to comply 
with the applicable requirements – subject to recognition by the authorities."
"The figure given for model year 
2023 is also subject to recognition by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)."
"For 2025, we anticipate a 
CO2 target in the USA of approximately 110 g CO2/km and expect to meet this target."
"For 2030, we aim to 
increase the share of electric vehicles in our new vehicle fleet to significantly more than 50%, which would put us 
within the target range of the current administration."
"The Volkswagen Group closely coordinates technology and product planning with its brands so as to avoid 
breaches of fleet fuel consumption limits."
"As part of our electrification campaign, we aim to offer our customers 
worldwide around 50 completely battery-electric models by 2030."
"By then, more than half of our new vehicles 
worldwide are to be fully electric."
"By 2030, the Volkswagen Group aims to have electrified its entire model 
portfolio, from high-volume models to premium vehicles."
"To this end, in addition to the Modular Electric Drive 
Toolkit (MEB), we have also developed an all-electric platform for our premium and sports brands – the Premium 
Platform Electric (PPE)."
"Furthermore, we are currently concentrating our energies on designing the Scalable 
Systems Platform (SSP), the successor platform for our future all-electric vehicles, in the Architecture tech-
nology initiative within the Group's NEW AUTO strategy."
"The strategic goals of this SSP platform are to further 
reduce variance by consistently enhancing synergies and thus tapping into considerable savings potential."
"To offer sustainable, affordable mobility in the future for as many people around the world as possible, we 
offer a range of drivetrains with a focus on electrification."
"From today’s perspective, conventional combustion 
engines will still continue to make up a large share of the drive portfolio in the coming years."
"In the interest of 
using resources responsibly, it is therefore essential to further enhance this engine segment and systematically 
consolidate it for specific markets."
"Powertrain measures such as significantly more sophisticated exhaust gas 
purification or mild hybridization of our vehicles, as well as vehicle measures such as optimized aerodynamics or 
reduced rolling resistance will be necessary to fulfill future emissions standards."
"We are preparing intensively for 
this as we develop our product portfolio."
It is more important to us than ever to rigorously pursue the modular approach.
"We are reducing the number 
of individual modules so that we can make a large product portfolio economically viable."
"For example, we are 
reducing the number of versions of conventional combustion engines in the Group in the long term as part of our 
transformation towards e-mobility."
"This will create capacity for the development and production of new electric 
drives."
"Life cycle engineering and recycling 
Technological innovation for reducing fuel consumption is not enough on its own to minimize the effect of 
vehicles on the environment."
"We consider the environmental impact caused by our products throughout the 
entire vehicle life cycle and at all stages of the value chain."
"Using life cycle 
engineering, we identify the stages of the life cycle at which improvements will have the greatest effect and 
develop appropriate solutions."
"Recycling, for example, is an important means of reducing environmental impact 
and conserving resources."
"When developing new vehicles, we therefore pay attention to the recyclability of the 
required materials and give recommendations that enable good separability of materials."
"We require the use of 
secondary materials, if these meet the same quality standards as primary materials."
"Under the European 
Directive on end-of-life vehicles, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles must be 85% recyclable and 95% 
recoverable."
Our vehicles registered in Europe comply with these standards.
"We use the life cycle approach to 
monitor our climate protection targets as well."
"For this purpose, we have developed the decarbonization index 
(DKI) as a parameter, which also recognizes the emissions of an average Group passenger car throughout its life 
cycle."
"168 
Sustainable Value Enhancement
Group Management Report 
Leveraging synergies increases efficiency 
When developing vehicles, we cooperate closely with our brands to leverage synergies."
"The joint strategy of our 
development alliance involves, for example, making the Group more competitive and viable in the long term by 
deploying resources more effectively and efficiently in the research and development of new mobility-related 
technologies, products and services."
"In our Group-wide development alliance, the brands therefore not only 
work with each other, but also for each other on key technologies, forming cross-brand networks of expertise to 
address topics of importance for the future."
"The Volkswagen Group further streamlined its innovation portfolio, gearing it towards multibrand technol-
ogies of the future in order to provide effective support for the brands’ capacity for innovation."
"In the reporting 
year, the new leading roles assigned to the brands in Technical Development in 2020 to increase efficiency and 
leverage synergies in module variance, components, parts and processes were applied to advance development 
to ensure the consistency of the innovation process."
"We coordinate the use of modules centrally to reduce costs, capital expenditure and complexity."
"We are 
seeking to reduce expenditure in the modular toolkits, while at the same time facilitating widespread electri-
fication and a focus on autonomous systems."
"We wish to achieve this through a considerable reduction in com-
plexity using streamlined platforms that synergize but do not overlap."
"To this end, the individual Group brands 
draw on the modular toolkits, thus creating synergies between the various models of a product line, as well as 
across the product lines."
"By optimizing the toolkits, we are giving ourselves the financial leeway needed for 
developments in topics of importance for the future."
"Connectivity and automated driving 
The mobility of people and goods is a prerequisite for economic growth and social development."
"But natural 
resources are dwindling and climate change is advancing."
"Customers call for comprehensive mobility concepts 
to minimize the environmental impact."
"Such solutions need to be efficient, sustainable, crisis-proof, customer-
oriented and accessible anytime and anywhere."
"We are researching and developing such concepts in our Group-wide alliance: when shaping the future of 
mobility, we are looking not only at the automobile and related services, but at all modes of transport, transport 
infrastructures and people’s mobility habits."
"Digital connectivity and automated driving allow for completely 
new approaches to solving problems."
"They can help us play our part in a comprehensive mobility system for the 
future and drive forward our industry’s transformation."
New software solutions are the basis for this.
"This is why the Volkswagen Group has declared software devel-
opment to be one of its target core competencies in its NEW AUTO strategy."
"Our software subsidiary CARIAD is 
responsible for this."
"It is to develop a sustainable, convenient, connected, safe automotive experience for the 
customers of our Group brands."
"CARIAD aims to provide answers to the strategic aspects of digitalization and 
pool the Group's software expertise."
"CARIAD’s developers work in innovation centers at sites in Germany, Europe, China and the USA."
"This is designed not only to improve the performance of vehicle computers but also to 
act as a key lever for the introduction of new services – even after vehicle production has begun."
"CARIAD already supplies updatable software and updates for current vehicle generations, brands and 
markets, for example as part of its E³ 1.1 architecture, with the goal of making the software secure and traceable."
"In the long term, CARIAD is to pool all of its solutions in an enhanced, scalable software platform that will be 
made available to the Group brands, from the volume segment up to the premium platform."
"This is expected to 
generate economies of scale and to lower the cost of growing software requirements in the vehicle for all brands."
"In 2023, CARIAD started to realign itself with an extensive transformation program."
"A new Board of Management 
team began by implementing a five-point plan."
"The aim is to accelerate the development and delivery of soft-
ware for the platforms."
"The reorganization will also lead to even closer collaboration between CARIAD and the 
Group brands."
"In 2023, for example, CARIAD, together with the Volkswagen Group, presented a new approach to 
the development of its E³ 2.0 architecture."
This is to form the basis for software-defined vehicles (SDV).
"In 
addition, the development of architecture for two Audi and Volkswagen vehicle projects will be bundled in future 
in a specially created SDV Hub."
"Further changes as part of the transformation program are set to materialize in 
2024."
E³ 2.0 is also set to pave the way for the autonomous driving functions of the future.
"The development of 
autonomous driving is a core element of the NEW AUTO strategy, with CARIAD responsible for developing 
partially and highly automated driving functions (up to Level 4) for the Volkswagen Group’s brands."
"These appli-
cations will be progressively introduced in the new vehicle models at different performance levels."
"Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles is responsible specifically for the areas of Mobility as a Service and Transportation as a 
Service (MaaS/TaaS)."
"The strategic technology initiative Volkswagen Group Mobility is promoting autonomous 
driving in conjunction with new service models, i.e."
"shared mobility in these areas using robotic shuttles and 
vans."
"CARIAD and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles will continue to drive the future rollout of automated and 
autonomous drive technologies together with development partners."
"Pooling strengths with strategic alliances  
The aim of our NEW AUTO strategy is to transform our core business activities and to expand the mobility 
solutions business area at the same time."
"It is decisive to the success of this plan that we place our innovative 
strength on even broader foundations."
"Within the Volkswagen Group, we combine our technological innovation activities in the Volkswagen Group 
Innovation unit."
"At seven locations worldwide in the USA, Europe and Asia, employees are working on sustain-
able solutions for urban and interurban mobility systems in line with our motto “Mobility for generations to 
come”."
"Technologies and activities that are ready for pre-development are regularly transferred from Volkswagen 
Group Innovation to our Group brands to ensure that the areas of digitalization, sustainability and e-mobility 
receive continuous support in innovative projects."
"In this way, we are creating an agile innovation structure that 
allows us to initiate new milestone projects with innovative international partners, even at short notice."
"170 
Sustainable Value Enhancement
Group Management Report 
Growth in the mobility sector is strongly defined through regional innovation activities."
"Volkswagen therefore 
concentrates its strategic venture-capital activities and partnerships in the Group’s international innovation 
ecosystem."
"This helps us to identify the regional needs of customers more precisely, to adjust our product range 
accordingly and to establish competitive cost structures."
"In doing so, we rely to a greater extent than in the past 
on partnerships, acquisitions and venture-capital investments and manage investment selection centrally so as 
to generate maximum value for the Group and its brands."
"It is against this backdrop that we formed an alliance 
with Ford Motor Company."
"At the beginning of June 2020, Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen AG signed 
additional contracts within their existing global alliance for light commercial vehicles and electrification."
"Among 
other things, these contracts define the basis for a total of three vehicle projects: a city van (Ford Tourneo 
Connect based on the Volkswagen Caddy), a mid-size pickup (Volkswagen Amarok based on the Ford Ranger) 
and a one-tonne cargo van."
The Ford Tourneo Connect and the Amarok have been on the market since 2022.
"The 
New Transporter will celebrate its world premiere in 2024."
"In addition, Ford will use the Modular Electric Drive 
Toolkit (MEB) developed by Volkswagen for two electric volume models."
"The aim of the cooperation is to place 
both Volkswagen and Ford in a position that enables them to improve their competitiveness, tailor their products 
to better meet the needs of customers worldwide and at the same time to leverage synergies related to cost and 
investment."
"To design the framework conditions for the approval and introduction of our own self-driving system, we are 
actively involved in public projects."
"The experience we are gathering here benefits the Group brands and thus 
our customers."
"The software subsidiary CARIAD is responsible throughout the Group for developing automated driving func-
tions for our brands’ customers."
"In the Automated Driving Alliance, CARIAD and Bosch are striving to make 
partially and highly automated driving suitable for the volume segment."
"The aim is to provide functions for Group 
vehicles that allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel at times if regulations allow this."
"In the 
alliance, both companies are jointly developing Level 2 hands-free systems for driving in cities, the countryside 
and on the highway, and a Level 3 system which will enable drivers to look away from the task of driving on the 
highway at times and perform certain other tasks."
"CARIAD is using a local partnership with Horizon Robotics to further consolidate development expertise in 
highly automated driving functions in the Chinese market."
CARIAD entered into a new partnership in China with the software provider ThunderSoft in 2023.
"The focus 
of the joint venture is a new customer experience when it comes to infotainment and connectivity."
"Over and above this, CARIAD is committed to open collaboration in the global developer community."
"For 
example, as a strategic member of the Software Defined Vehicle working group run by the Eclipse Foundation 
open-source community, CARIAD is involved in developing automotive software more efficiently and promoting 
innovation."

Key R&D figures 
In fiscal year 2023, we filed 5,792 (5,305) patent applications worldwide for employee inventions, the majority of 
them in Germany."
"The fact that an ever-increasing share of these patents is for important cutting-edge fields 
underscores our Company’s innovative power."
"These fields include driver assistance systems and automation, 
digitalization, connectivity and alternative drive systems."
"The Automotive Division’s total research and development costs in the reporting year amounted to €21.8 
(18.9) billion and were 15.2% higher than in the previous year; their share of the Automotive Division’s sales 
revenue – the R&D ratio – was unchanged at 8.1 (8.1)%."
"In addition to new models, our activities focused above 
all on the electrification of our vehicle portfolio, digitalization, new technologies and enhancements of our modu-
lar and all-electric toolkits and platforms."
The capitalization ratio was 51.2 (51.4)%.
"Research and development 
expenditure recognized in profit or loss in accordance with the IFRSs increased to €15.8 (14.3) billion."
"As of December 31, 2023, our Research and Development departments – including the equity-accounted 
Chinese joint ventures – employed 59,626 people (+1.2%) Group-wide, corresponding to 8.7% of the total work-
force."

PROCUREMENT 
The main task for Procurement is to help steer the Company’s success in the areas of efficiency, sustainability 
and resilience."
"2023 was mainly devoted to safeguarding the supply of vehicle parts and optimizing costs in 
order to make a contribution to the Group’s result."
"The previous year’s rising energy prices again resulted in 
catch-up effects at our suppliers in the reporting year."
"Dealing with supplier requirements so as to safeguard the 
supply of our components was therefore a key task for Group Procurement."
"Procurement strategy  
The procurement organizations at the Volkswagen Group are an integral part of the NEW AUTO Group strategy."
"A 
key task is to strengthen the procurement network and intensify cooperation across brands and regions."
"Making 
use of global synergies also creates potential for a long-term reduction in costs for raw materials, components 
and services."
"The frequency, duration and intensity of crises and the supply chain disruption they entail have risen signifi-
cantly since the beginning of the 2020s."
"As a consequence, the procurement organizations intend to work 
together with internal interface partners and suppliers to strengthen supply resilience."
"The transformation of the automotive industry toward e-mobility means that the procurement organizations 
must adapt their supplier network."
"The way in which the Volkswagen Group works with these suppliers will be 
shaped on an individual basis through strategic partnerships, treating the transformation as a joint undertaking."
"Expansion of partnerships is generally another area of focus in Procurement, both internally in the form of collab-
oration across brands and departments and externally with the Volkswagen Group’s suppliers."
"Digitalization and 
efficient processes are the foundation for all such strategic measures."
"The roll-out of a new digital supplier plat-
form for interaction and the successful connection of the cross-sectoral data network Catena-X in 2022 were 
particularly noteworthy in this regard."
"E-mobility  
As technology advances, the automotive industry is rapidly forging ahead with its transformation toward  
e-mobility."
"A key task for Procurement is to safeguard supplies in order to meet the constantly growing require-
ments brought about by this change in a way that is sustainable and cost-efficient."
"Sustainable actions, trans-
parent supply streams, and energy- and carbon-optimized supply chains are important elements of our contract 
awards."
"We support our partners with active management of the supplier transformation, as the industry moves 
from combustion-engine to all-electric vehicles, and with a lasting reduction in CO2 emissions along the entire 
supply chain."
"To put our Company in a leading cost position, we award Group contracts that pool global demand 
from the markets of Europe, North and South America, and Asia-Pacific."
"To reduce economic and geopolitical 
risks, we use diversified supply chains in conjunction with a dual-supplier strategy as well as localization of the 
supplier portfolio for all core components of our all-electric vehicle fleet."
"Digitalization of supply  
We are working to implement a completely digitalized supply chain."
"This is intended to help us to safeguard 
supply and leverage synergies throughout the Group."
"We are therefore creating a shared database and using 
innovative technologies to enable efficient, networked collaboration in real time – both within the Group and 
with our partners."
"The Procurement division aims to standardize transactions with our suppliers in the future and 
automate them where possible."
"This will not only reduce transaction costs but will also accelerate business 
processes."
"The integration of Catena-X, the data network for the automotive industry, is one important part of  
 
 
 
 
173 
Sustainable Value Enhancement
Group Management Report 
this."
"It will allow possible supply risks to be identified at an earlier stage and appropriate measures and alterna-
tives to be jointly developed faster."
"We are following the implementation of Procurement’s digitalization strategy 
with the specific aim of not only eliminating the weaknesses of Procurement’s IT system environment but also 
increasing the organization’s effectiveness, efficiency and future viability."
"The initial systems or modules such as 
a cloud-based module for automating procurement activities in the vehicle project phase and an acclaimed 
online negotiation tool have already been implemented and integrated into the existing system environment."
"Structure of key purchasing markets  
Procurement at the Volkswagen Group is responsible for ensuring cost-efficient, resilient and sustainable supply 
chains."
"Procurement is organized at a global level, with a presence in the most important purchasing markets 
around the world."
"Alongside local bodies and decision-making structures, Group Procurement manages the 
brands and regions."
This helps us to jointly implement potential cost savings and to control risks.
"Organized net-
working of the procurement organization in the brands will enable us to leverage Group-wide synergies and 
purchase production materials, investments in property, plant and equipment, and services worldwide at the 
quality required and on the best possible terms."
"In addition to the brands’ procurement units, Procurement 
operates regional offices in strategic purchasing markets."
"Working together in the procurement organization, 
these constantly identify and qualify new local suppliers."
"Supply chain management in Procurement 
Supply chain management activities at Procurement are focused on safeguarding supplies during start-up 
phases and for series production."
"This entails providing support in our suppliers’ industrialization processes, 
monitoring series production and managing supply crises, which may arise, for example, as a result of geo-
political crises such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict or natural disasters such as the flooding in Slovenia."
"By intro-
ducing strategic semiconductor purchasing, the Volkswagen Group is realigning the procurement of these 
electronic components for the future."
"The procurement organization therefore intends to assume direct negoti-
ating responsibility for strategically important semiconductor volumes so as to safeguard long-term supply and 
ensure competitiveness."
"Even in the early stages of new projects, we conduct audits to ensure that our suppliers will be able to deliver."
"Furthermore, we provide support for purchased parts along the individual project milestones up to the start of 
production."
"Complex components in particular frequently require onsite support from our supplier management 
team."
"Finally, an acceptance test of production capacities is carried out to facilitate the timely start of series 
production of the vehicles at our plants."
"In addition, regular checks are carried out during series production, for example related to the continuous 
matching of demand and capacity or possible capacity adjustments at suppliers."
"This also safeguards the capac-
ity at suppliers when using existing components in new projects."
"Thanks to our established crisis management structure and global supplier network, we are able to overcome 
complex challenges along the supply chain and have access to a wide range of locations and technologies."
"Cross-divisional work among Procurement, Quality Assurance, Development, Production and Logistics largely 
prevented looming losses due to supply risks and, in cases where a reaction was required, maintained pro-
duction capability."
"Nevertheless, the precarious situation in global supply chains resulted in limited vehicle avail-
ability for customers, albeit to a lesser degree than in the prior year."
"Sustainability in supplier relationships  
Successful relationships with our business partners are based on respecting human rights, compliance with 
occupational health and safety standards, active environmental protection and combating corruption."
"These 
sustainability standards are defined in the contractually binding Volkswagen Group Requirements for 
Sustainability in Relations with Business Partners (Code of Conduct for Business Partners), updated in 2023."
"The 
  
 
 
 
174 
Sustainable Value Enhancement
Group Management Report 
Code of Conduct for Business Partners also sets out the expectation that business partners will pass on the 
requirements formulated therein along the supply chain."
"We review compliance with the requirements, which 
has been an explicit condition for the award of contracts since 2019, using sustainability ratings (S-rating) for 
relevant companies and suppliers."
"The relevance of a business partner for this rating depends, among other 
things, on the size of the company or the risk exposure arising from the type of service provided."
"In our sustainability rating, we determine the sustainability performance of our suppliers by means of self-
disclosures and in a risk-based evaluation process involving audits."
"In the reporting year, we received 10,912  
S-ratings for suppliers."
"The proportion of revenue contributed by suppliers with a positive S-rating amounts to 
79% of the total procurement volume."
"Both the validation of the questionnaire and the performance of the audits 
are carried out by selected service providers."
"As a rule, contracts are not awarded to suppliers who fail to meet 
our requirements concerning compliance with sustainability standards."
"Tying award decisions to sustainability 
criteria is one of the strongest levers for enforcing these."
"We address existing sustainability risks and violations 
of sustainability principles by systematically defining and implementing measures to correct these; this also 
includes the upstream supply chain."
"To enable continuous supplier development, we invite our suppliers to 
attend sustainability training courses and workshops on specific topics at selected sites or online and also offer 
web-based training."
"In the reporting year, over 7,700 suppliers received such training."
"With regard to decarbonization, the Volkswagen Group is striving to continuously reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions or avoid them altogether over the entire life cycle of a vehicle."
"We are aware of our social responsibility and are 
committed to the Paris Climate Agreement."
"In the Modular Electric Drive Toolkit (MEB), we have incorporated the 
use of renewable energy, among other things, into the contracts with cell manufacturers."
"For new vehicle 
projects, CO2 emissions will be a technical feature for relevant components for the Volkswagen Group in the 
future."
"This means our suppliers will be given binding CO2 targets, with which they must be able to demonstrate 
compliance at any time."
"One example is the Scalable Systems Platform (SSP), the new mechatronics platform on 
which the batteries have a CO2 limit."
"To be able to achieve these limits, suppliers need to implement measures in 
their own production processes and upstream chains – for example, the use of renewable electricity."
"Measures 
like these are designed to reduce the carbon footprint of many electric vehicle models."
"models, the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand uses additional sustainable components, including battery cases and wheel 
rims made of CO2-reduced aluminum."
"family’s carbon footprint is to be improved by around 
two tonnes per vehicle by 2025."
"In our sustainable supply management, we are also involved in protecting groups of people who may be 
subject to a high risk of potential human rights violations at any point in our supply chain."
"We implemented a 
Human Rights Focus System in 2022 to achieve greater impact in this context."
"Our aim here is to identify and 
work on issues that can be associated with human rights and environmental risks and that require more in-depth 
analysis."
"The aim is to implement suitable prevention and remedial measures that take into account the diverse 
and often structural causes of human rights violations."
"We continued to implement our activities as part of the 
raw materials due diligence management system in 2023 to manage the sometimes extensive risks in the 
upstream raw material supply chains."
"The management system currently comprises 18 high-risk raw materials, 
for which we use risk-based specific measures to identify, measure and, in particular, reduce sustainability risks."
"For our battery suppliers, transparency requirements constitute an important basis for responsible raw material 
purchasing."
"Within the framework of these contractual requirements, we ask, for example, that our battery sup-
pliers disclose their entire upstream supply chain before we award new contracts."

"TECHNOLOGY 
The “Technology” Board function is divided into four pillars, the so-called tech stacks."
"Cross-brand management of technology activities and a value creation strategy coordinated throughout the 
Group are designed to improve the Group’s future viability and competitiveness."
"Synergies are to be leveraged 
across both traditional technologies and future areas to advance the transition to e-mobility."
"The Volkswagen Group formalized its objectives for “Battery, Charging & Energy” by 2030 in its technology 
roadmap."
"With the battery roadmap, we aim to substantially reduce the complexity and cost of this key technol-
ogy so as to make electric vehicles attractive and affordable for as many people as possible."
"Battery 
Our battery activities pillar is divided into two areas: the Center of Excellence and PowerCo."
"The responsibilities 
of the Center of Excellence include Group-wide product management, procurement and quality assurance for the 
battery cell and battery system, and closed-loop recycling."
"PowerCo will be an important cell supplier for the 
Group in the future."
"In 2022, Volkswagen founded PowerCo SE, its own battery company, which will bundle the Group’s global 
cell production activities."
"From the new European battery hub in Salzgitter, this company will manage the devel-
opment of international factory operations, continuous development of cell technology, vertical integration of the 
value chain and supplies of machinery and equipment to factories."
"PowerCo’s approach is based on two key 
concepts with which it aims to set future industry standards: a unified cell enables flexible use of different 
battery chemicals and is intended to be used in up to 80% of all Group models in future."
"The second key concept 
is the standard factory, which aims to enable the rapid rollout of in-house production with standardized build-
ings, equipment, IT and infrastructure and will thus be quickly and flexibly adaptable to future innovations."
The Group’s first own cell factory based on this model is being built in Salzgitter and is due to open in 2025.
The first machinery for cell production was delivered and installed in 2023.
"Alongside Salzgitter, a second cell 
factory is being built in Valencia, Spain."
"In 2023, PowerCo also took the decision to build another cell factory in 
St."
"Each factory is to operate on renewable power and be designed for future closed-loop 
recycling."
Vertical integration of value creation is a major component of the battery strategy.
"By building up its own cell 
production, Volkswagen will progressively take charge of further stages of the value chain so that it can exercise 
greater influence over the availability, cost and sustainability of key raw materials and other items."
"The supply of 
raw materials is being safeguarded using a three-part strategy: long-term supply contracts, investment with 
partners, and procurement on the commodity spot market, backed up by financial hedging."
"Cathode materials have a key role to play in the transformation to e-mobility as a driving cost factor and main 
component in batteries."
"PowerCo and the Belgian materials technology group Umicore have formed the joint 
venture IONWAY, which aims to supply cathode and primary materials to the European cell factories starting in 
2025."
The partners aim to be producing materials for 160 GWh of cell capacity per year by the end of the decade.
The planned cathode factory will be built in Nysa/Poland.

Charging and Energy 
Since 2021, the Charging and Energy area has played a key role in the Volkswagen Group’s e-mobility strategy 
with the aim of becoming a leading provider of a smart charging and energy ecosystem."
"As part of the strategic alignment, the Group is focusing on two key areas."
"Firstly, sales of electric vehicles are 
being underpinned by the development of a global fast-charging infrastructure."
"In Europe, the Group and its 
brands are involved in the pan-European joint venture IONITY, the Ewiva joint venture in Italy and other 
partnerships."
"By 2025, the number of public fast-charging points in Europe is to increase to 18,000."
"At the same 
time, both the North American charging network Electrify America – already one of the largest public charging 
networks in the USA – is to be expanded to 8,000 fast-charging points and CAMS in China is to be enlarged to 
17,000 fast-charging points."
"Secondly, the Group is opening up new business models involving smart charging 
and energy solutions."
"The Group operates as one of the largest vehicle-charging subscription providers in Europe 
with its charging and energy brand Elli."
"Its charging network offers access to over 600,000 charging points 
Europe-wide with approximately 35,000 fast-charging points in 27 countries."
"In addition, Elli’s product portfolio 
also includes the full range of charging solutions for private customers and companies, from the Company’s own 
wall box to the flexible fast-charging station Flexpole and smart charging solutions."
"As part of a pilot project 
involving the smart control of stationary batteries, Elli also began trading electricity in 2023."
"This makes 
Volkswagen the first automotive group to trade on the EPEX Spot power exchange."
"Volkswagen Group Components 
The independent corporate entity Volkswagen Group Components, under the umbrella of Volkswagen AG, forms 
the third pillar of the “Technology” Board function."
"Some 70,000 staff with expertise in developing and manufac-
turing vehicle components work worldwide in more than 60 plants at 45 sites."
"The product portfolio is focused on technical components such as chassis, axle systems, steering, transmis-
sion, electric drives, thermal management systems in the electric drivetrain and battery systems."
"With its entry into e-mobility, Volkswagen Group Components were able to work systematically on optimizing 
the electric drivetrain thanks to close cooperation between product management and development."
"In 2023, it 
debuted the new, highly efficient APP550 electric drive, which features both higher performance and improved 
efficiency."
"The new powertrain was developed by Volkswagen Group Components together with Technical 
Development at Volkswagen Passenger Cars and is being used for the first time in the Volkswagen ID.7."
"It is 
produced at Volkswagen’s site in Kassel."
"Platform Business 
The fourth pillar of the “Technology” Board function is Platform Business (third-party business), which pools 
Group-wide responsibility for the sale of platforms and components to external companies."
"This organizational 
unit is responsible for the successful initiation, acquisition (including contract design) and support of customer 
projects including the related order processing (logistics, billing)."
"In the cooperation project with Ford, the 
necessary cross-brand structures and processes have been created within the Volkswagen organization so that 
other external customers can also be efficiently served in the future."
"Ford plans to produce approximately  
1.2 million MEB-based vehicles for the European market by the end of the decade."
"In 2023, the automaker 
presented the Ford Explorer, the first model based on the MEB."
"Volkswagen is also continuing to explore a supply 
agreement with Indian automaker Mahindra for MEB components such as electric motors and battery cells."

PRODUCTION 
Our international cross-brand production network covers all stages in the process from the supplier to the fac-
tory and assembly line, and from the factory to dealers and customers."
"Its enduring efficiency is a prerequisite for 
our competitiveness."
"To be able to meet the challenges of the future, we rely on holistic optimizations, forward-
looking innovations, robust supply streams and structures, and flexibility in the production network."
"At 9.31 
million vehicles, the Volkswagen Group’s global vehicle production in fiscal year 2023, including the Chinese 
joint ventures, was 6.8% up on the prior-year figure."
"Productivity, including the Chinese joint ventures, increased 
by 2.5% compared with the previous year."
"Both the parts shortages and the disruption of supply chains, most recently caused by the flooding in 
Slovenia, restricted production in the Volkswagen Group in 2023."
"The supply and production situation eased 
toward the end of the reporting year."
"one.PRODUCTION production strategy 
Production is supporting the NEW AUTO Group strategy with its one.PRODUCTION functional area strategy."
"We 
are sharpening our focus in the transformation of our production and logistics, whereby our aim is to minimize 
expenditure, streamline processes and strengthen the team."
The overarching aim is to increase productivity and profitability.
"This will enable us to manufacture high-
quality products at our sites that give customers maximum benefit at competitive prices."
"We are adopting a 
cross-brand approach for the thematic focus of our activities in order to pool the strengths and potential of our 
global production and logistics across brands and take advantage of the resulting synergies."
Our strategy process is based on a scenario methodology.
"As part of this, the strategic orientation of pro-
duction is checked at regular intervals to verify that it is up to date."
"This provides the thematic framework for the 
topics being focused on in the year in question."
"These range from people-related subjects such as skills fore-
casts, to efficient and resilient processes, safeguarding the achievement of cost targets, digitalization and the 
environment, and the production and logistics network."
"Global production network 
The Group’s production network encompasses 115 production sites, including our Chinese joint ventures."
"70 of 
these sites are vehicle production plants."
"Standardizing production with uniform product concepts, plants, 
operating equipment and production processes within a product family is a key factor in our forward-looking 
production."
"We are constantly enhancing our production concepts and aligning them with new technologies to 
achieve ambitious targets in the individual projects."
"In a challenging environment, the Volkswagen Group 
succeeded in starting up 44 vehicle projects in 2023, 16 of which were new products or successor products and 
28 were product upgrades and derivatives."
"The flexible production capacities provided by our platforms allow us to respond to changing market require-
ments, make needs-based use of the production network, and leverage synergies across brands through multi-
brand sites."
"Of the 45 vehicle production plants for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, almost half are 
already multibrand sites."
Models for this approach within the Group are the Bratislava and Zwickau sites.
"In 
Bratislava, vehicles of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Škoda, Audi and Porsche brands are produced on the 
joint Modular Longitudinal Toolkit (MLB) and Modular Transversal Toolkit (MQB) platforms."
"At present, we are 
manufacturing vehicles of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi and CUPRA brands on the joint Modular Electric 
Drive Toolkit (MEB) platforms in Zwickau."
"The focus here is on mobility solutions that are innovative, efficient, 
sustainable and customer-oriented, as well as geared towards profitable growth."
"The introduction of the MEB 
served as a basis for this, and complements our portfolio with additional battery-electric vehicles."
"We have been 
manufacturing battery-electric vehicles based on the MEB in Zwickau, the Volkswagen Group’s first fully 
electrified car factory, since 2019."
One example is the ID.3 from the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand.
"From 
2021, the portfolio of the MEB platform in Zwickau was expanded through the addition of the CUPRA Born, the 
Audi Q4 e-tron and the ID.5 from Volkswagen Passenger Cars."
"Since 2023, Volkswagen has also been manu-
facturing the ID.7 on the MEB platform in Emden."
"Furthermore, we use the all-electric platform for premium and 
sports brands – the Premium Platform Electric (PPE) – to leverage synergies in production across the brands."
"This meant that electric vehicles were manufactured at 18 sites across the global production network as of year-
end 2023."
"New technologies and digitalization  
As part of the one.PRODUCTION strategy, the Group has developed the “Operating System 2030+” approach – a 
cross-brand vision for the factory of the future."
"An important dimension of this, and a prerequisite for achieving it, 
is digitalization towards autonomous factories."
"The digital transformation is thus shaping the future devel-
opment of our process landscape and data ecosystem."
"The corresponding switch to value stream- and product-
oriented software development within the Group is bringing greater focus and speed to the implementation of 
solutions."
"Overall, more than 69 new applications are already available for use in the production and logistics 
processes."
"Examples range from virtual training courses for new vehicle start-ups to the identification and 
implementation of potential energy savings and the use of artificial intelligence for parts supply by the Sched-
uling departments."
"The applications are now being rolled out to over 40 plants via the Digital Production 
Platform (DPP) jointly developed with our strategic partner Amazon Web Services (AWS)."
"In 2023, Volkswagen continued its commitment to Catena-X, the first open and collaborative data space for 
the automotive industry."
"With Catena-X, Volkswagen is shaping the future of the automotive supply chain in

conjunction with other manufacturers and suppliers worldwide."
"The aim is to build a global data ecosystem for 
the automotive industry with shared values regarding collaboration, data sovereignty, trust and cooperation."
"Material traceability along with overarching demand and capacity management and comprehensive bottleneck 
management are some examples of how we intend to increase the efficiency of our plants and meet future 
supply chain requirements at the same time."
"We began using the first applications for partner data management 
in the supply chain in 2023."
"Further solutions, for instance for quality cycles and managing shortages of 
materials, are to follow in 2024."
"In the Volkswagen Group, digital and innovative technologies are systematically validated and their use for 
production and logistics is piloted and rolled out."
"This is to enable the Group to exploit potential for cost savings 
in the value chain and realize more flexible implementation options, as well as quality improvements."
"The goal of 
the digital transformation in production and logistics is to simplify the entire process chain, make the best 
possible use of new technologies and establish autonomous processes."
"Fields of innovation in 2023 included 
computer vision, augmented reality, process mining, AI robotics and what is known as generative artificial intel-
ligence (GenAI)."
"For example, artificial intelligence is being used on Volkswagen’s proprietary computer vision 
platform to perform tasks such as complex image evaluations within the operational production process, and is 
continuously transferred to other sites across the brands."
"Opportunities to use GenAI are also being evaluated 
and tested across departments and brands."
"Zero Impact Factory 
We are planning the production of tomorrow with our one.PRODUCTION functional area strategy."
"The use of 
resources and emission levels at Volkswagen Group sites require particular attention."
"In the Zero Impact Factory 
program, we are developing specific steps towards more sustainable production, guided by the vision of a 
factory that has no adverse environmental impact."
"The brands have been using the measurement methods and 
management tools developed for this since 2022."
"These enable us to record and reduce the quantitative 
environmental impact of our production sites, particularly in the areas requiring action of climate protection and 
energy, emissions, water and waste."
A further important milestone was reached in 2023.
"This makes it possible to compare the environmental impacts with one another 
and means we can implement reduction measures targeted at precisely those areas in which the greatest 
positive impact for the environment can be achieved."
"We use a site checklist to continuously review the status of 
implementation of a further 143 environmental criteria."
"Examples of these include projects and measures geared 
towards maintaining biodiversity, establishing environmentally friendly employee mobility, and promoting the 
circular economy."
"From 2025, the Zero Impact Factory method is to replace the existing KPI system, which measures the reduc-
tion of the environmental impact of production (UEP)."
"This represents a shift away from steering based on indi-
cators that are purely performance-based and vehicle-specific to a reduction in the environmental impact of our 
production in absolute terms."
"Our goal is to achieve Zero Impact status for all of our manufacturing plants for 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 2050."
"To support programs such as these, a management system developed in-house started being introduced at 
all production sites worldwide in mid-2019, linking the main compliance issues with key environmental 
management issues."
"This environmental compliance management system (ECMS) provides the foundation for 
compliance with all external and internal rules and regulations relating to the environment."
"ECMS implementation was initially concentrated on the major production and development locations, and 
was extended in a second step to include Group companies whose business activities entail a lower environ-

mental risk."
"We continued to actively support, monitor and track the rollout and advisory process in the reporting 
year."
"We are encouraging networking and communication between the brands worldwide in order to leverage 
synergies."
Our environmental experts meet regularly in working groups.
"In addition, we provide our managers 
and employees with specific training on the topic of environmental protection."
"We record and catalog measures in an IT system and make these available for a Group-wide exchange of best 
practices."
"In the reporting year, approximately 1,540 implemented measures in the area of environment and 
energy were tracked and documented via the Maßnahmen@Web system."
"They serve to improve infrastructure 
and production processes for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles and are incorporated into the 
decarbonization index (DKI), for example."
"These activities may have a positive effect on the Group’s environ-
mental indicators and are often beneficial from an economic perspective."
"Zero Impact Logistics 
In the joint Zero Impact Logistics initiative, the Group and brand logistics departments work together to achieve 
the goals of the goTOzero environmental mission statement."
"By continuously optimizing the transport network 
and logistics processes – for example by means of digitalization – we can avoid unnecessary shipments and 
reduce emissions."
"In addition, the use of new low-emission technologies for transporting production materials 
and vehicles is examined, piloted and accelerated."
"Volkswagen 
also transports high-voltage batteries for electric vehicles in an environmentally conscious and efficient manner, 
for example at the Volkswagen component site in Braunschweig."
"Here, the batteries are loaded fully auto-
matically onto trains that run on renewable power, which then take them to the Volkswagen plant in Zwickau."
"Group Logistics uses two roll-on/roll-off charter ships powered by low-pollution liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
to transport vehicles across the North Atlantic."
"At the end of 2023, it started the gradual introduction of four 
more LNG-powered car freighters, and is thus progressively replacing conventionally operated ships."
"Compared 
to other LNG-fueled marine engines, Group Logistics’ charter ships are more climate-friendly because the high-
pressure technology of the two-stroke engines from MAN Energy Solutions allows almost no methane to escape."
"In principle, the dual-fuel engines will also enable non-fossil fuels – such as biogas (bio-LNG), e-gas (synthetic 
gas) from renewables and biofuel – to be used in future."
"This will allow carbon emissions to be reduced even 
further."
"In the long term, Group Logistics also sees further potential to reduce the level of CO2 with other 
alternative fuels."
Group Logistics permanently operates two charter ships powered by biofuel on European sea routes.
"This fuel 
produces less CO2 than conventional fossil fuels, it is made from used cooking oils and fats."
"These waste and 
residual materials that stem, for example, from the catering and food industries, cannot be used for further 
processing into food or animal feed."
"Together with their sales partners and importers, our passenger car brands agreed on a procedure for 
integrating state-of-the-art products and services into the sales network."
"The priority thereby is the safe and 
legally compliant handling of customer data and the way in which this is processed for digital products and 
services or in connection with the vehicle purchase."
"The legal requirements for handling customer data have 
been tightened in many countries."
"At the same time, the Group is launching a growing number of vehicles that 
are connected to the internet where available and depending on a vehicle’s features."
"We are increasingly 
investing in distribution systems and processes with the goal of further digitalizing and improving the individual 
customer experience in all distribution channels."
"The Volkswagen Group’s financial strength and profitability is 
attributable to an extensive portfolio of strong brands."
"We want to continuously sharpen the brand profiles and 
to distinguish as clearly as possible between the customer segments served by the brands, supplementing them 
as required with tailored solutions."
"Our aim is to achieve high market saturation with great efficiency and a low 
level of brand cannibalization."
"To this end, we have established automobile-specific customer segmentation to 
steer and improve the positioning of our brands, which we consistently apply throughout the strategy and 
product process."
"As part of our NEW AUTO strategy, we have introduced strategic base initiatives for China as the largest 
single market and North America as the market with the greatest growth potential due to their considerable 
strategic importance for the Volkswagen Group."
"We have used the Group strategy as the foundation for our new 
functional area strategy called NEW SALES 2030, which forms the basis for transforming our sales activities in 
the direction of a mobility provider."
"The aim of NEW SALES 2030 is to enable us to provide an even more flexible 
and targeted response to our customers’ wishes and leverage additional revenue potential, for example through 
digital business models."
"With regard to its NEW AUTO strategy, Volkswagen hit another milestone as part of the “Volkswagen Group 
Mobility” tech initiative in July 2022 with the closing of the transaction with Europcar."
"This successful joint 
acquisition with two consortium partners is important in helping to drive the growth of the Volkswagen Group in 
vehicle-on-demand (VoD) services."
"Europcar is to become a cornerstone of a product portfolio that will cover 
customers’ mobility needs from vehicle sharing for a few hours to subscription for multiple months."
"Our 
expectation is that most people will still prefer individual mobility by 2030 but the focus will be more on using 
and less on owning vehicles."
"The Volkswagen Group is aiming to participate in the global market for mobility 
services, which is expected to grow rapidly."
"Also in the area of sales and marketing, we are aware of our responsibility towards the climate and the 
environment."
"In addition to the broad range of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models, we kicked off the 
goTOzero retail project that is focused on decarbonizing our entire sales network and increasing its ESG 
performance, helping our sales partners to move over to a climate-neutral business model."
"As a result, the 
carbon footprint of our sales network is to be reduced by at least 30% by 2030 compared with 2020."
"In order to 
identify and successfully implement the right measures, we have produced manuals, training courses and 
marketing materials for our partners."
"In addition, a certification model has been established for the entire sales 
network in response to both regulatory requirements and customer expectations."
"Customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and customer conquest 
The Volkswagen Group aims its sales activities at exciting its customers."
"This is our top priority, as satisfied 
customers remain loyal to our brands and recommend our products and services to others."
"For this we measure 
customer satisfaction with our brands at different customer contact points and make it a subject of discussion at 
Board committee meetings."
"In addition to satisfaction with our products and services, we value our customers’ 
emotional connection to our brands."
It is important for us to retain customers and win new ones.
"Thanks to their faithful customers, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Porsche brands have remained in 
the upper loyalty rankings of the core European markets in comparison with their competitors for a number of 
years."
Audi and Škoda also have above-average customer loyalty ratings.
"Compared to other manufacturer 
groups, the Volkswagen Group continues to hold a top spot in the core European markets in terms of loyalty."
"The 
conquest rate shows the share of newly acquired passenger car customers as a proportion of a brand-specific 
selection of competitors."
"The Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Audi brands improved their conquest rates in 
2023, while the figures for Škoda and Porsche were on a level with the previous year."
"In the core European markets, brand image and confidence in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand 
stabilized above the level for the market as a whole in 2023."
"Audi and Porsche continue to occupy top places in 
the image ranking."
"E-mobility and digitalization in Group Sales 
As part of our electrification campaign, we aim to offer our customers worldwide around 50 completely battery-
electric vehicles by 2030."
"This campaign will be complemented by vehicle-related, customer-focused offerings, 
such as customized charging infrastructure solutions and mobile online services."
"The Volkswagen Group is thus 
transforming from an automotive manufacturer into a mobility service provider."
"This poses new challenges for 
Sales."
"Digitalization provides many opportunities for Sales, including improved customer contact."
"Our actions are 
guided by a clearly defined strategy that requires extensive cooperation between the brands and markets to 
achieve the greatest possible synergies."
"Our aim here is to create a completely new product experience for the 
customers of our brands – one which impresses with a seamless communication process, from the initial interest 
in purchasing a vehicle, to servicing and ultimately to the sale of the used car."
"In doing so, we are opening up 
new business models relating to the connected vehicle – in particular with regard to mobility and other services."
Vehicles are becoming an integral part of the customer’s digital world of experience.
"We also align our internal processes and structures to the methods and new forms of working created by 
digital innovation."
"Car subscription 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG expanded the portfolio of mobility services offered by the Volkswagen Group 
and its brands in 2023."
"Progress has been made particularly in the collaboration with the Europcar Mobility 
Group (EMG)."
"Numerous joint projects worldwide are currently being worked on, from mobility services for fleet 
customers to cooperation on the marketing of used vehicles."
"The Volkswagen Financial Services AG mobility platform is continuously enlarging its portfolio of mobility 
services for the Group brands."
Its solutions offer the use of vehicles for anything from minutes to years.
"Particularly noteworthy is the expansion of flexible subscription products, which progressed as planned in 2023."
"In Germany, the portfolio was expanded to include the Škoda brand."
"September 2023 saw the launch of the 
Volkswagen Abonnement, a subscription service also offered through EMG for the Volkswagen Passenger Cars 
brand in France."
"Fleet customer business 
Business relationships with fleet customers are often long-term partnerships."
"In a volatile environment, this 
customer group provides greater stability for sales of well-equipped, profitable vehicle models than the private 
customer segment."

Group Management Report 
The Volkswagen Group has an established base of business fleet customers, especially in Germany and the rest 
of Europe."
Our extensive product range enables us to satisfy their individual mobility needs from a single source.
"In an overall passenger car market in Germany that grew by 7.3% in the reporting year, business fleet 
customers accounted for 21.4 (18.8)% of total registrations."
"The Volkswagen Group’s share of this customer 
segment increased to 47.0 (43.5)%."
"Outside Germany, the Group’s share of registrations by fleet customers in 
Europe was 27.6 (25.7)%."
This shows that fleet customers’ confidence in the Group remains at a high level.
"We 
were able to consolidate our strong market position in the fleet customer business in Europe."
"After Sales and Service  
In the after-sales business, we regard ourselves as a complete provider of all products and services relevant to 
customers."
"Together with our partners, our mission is to ensure lifelong mobility for our customers and vehicles."
"We are therefore continuously expanding our portfolio of tailor-made offers and services with the aim of 
improving customer experience and the satisfaction of our customers."
"The partner businesses also offer a com-
prehensive portfolio of services in all vehicle classes."
"In After Sales, we are supporting the changing world of mobility and our systematic focus on e-mobility by 
developing new services and innovative concepts."
"As the Group transforms from vehicle manufacturer to a 
leading, global provider of sustainable mobility, our software company CARIAD is working on the development of 
the future software architecture for our vehicles."
"With the resulting connectivity services, we will also be able to 
generate synergies in After Sales across all the Volkswagen Group’s brands and take advantage of new 
opportunities to boost customer loyalty."
"In addition to individual service, the timely provision of genuine parts is essential to assure passenger car 
customer satisfaction in After Sales."
"The genuine parts supplied by our passenger car brands and the expertise of 
the service centers stand for the quality, safety and value retention of our customers’ vehicles."
"With our global 
after sales network including more than 130 of our own warehouses, we are creating the prerequisites to supply 
almost all our authorized service facilities around the world within 24 hours."
"Owing to disruptions in supply 
chains we were unable to fully guarantee in-time delivery of replacement parts in certain cases during the

"In the Digital After Sales project, we are modernizing processes and IT systems in After Sales."
"In addition, innovative digital after-sales 
services will improve the customer experience."
"Around the world, our commercial vehicles business also prides itself on products of quality and on customer 
focus."
"Our range of trucks, buses and engines is complemented by services that aim to guarantee fuel efficiency, 
reliability and wide vehicle availability."
"By offering vehicles equipped with an all-electric or hybrid drive system, 
we take into account both customers’ wishes and our responsibility to contribute to emission-free transport-
tation."
"Workshop service and service contracts are intended to offer customers a high degree of certainty, in 
addition to a high level of quality."
"We are reducing servicing times and costs with a view to the vehicles’ total 
operating costs."
"In the Power Engineering segment, we help our customers to secure the availability of machinery with MAN

QUALITY 
The quality of our products and services plays a key role in maintaining customer satisfaction."
"Customers are 
satisfied and loyal particularly when their expectations of a product or service are met or even exceeded."
"Appeal, 
reliability and service determine quality as it is perceived by the customer throughout the entire product expe-
rience."
"Our objective is to positively surprise our customers and inspire enthusiasm in all areas, and thus to win 
them over with our quality."
"Digitalization was once again the beating heart of our work in the past fiscal year: we are continuously 
sharpening our focus on software-based system development, which is a critical factor for success in respect of 
customer satisfaction."
"Consistent application of the “Automotive SPICE” process assessment model that we use 
to improve our processes is particularly important in our activities."
"It is a key building block for meeting the 
requirements of our customers, as well as those of the regulatory and legislative bodies."
Volkswagen has been implementing cybersecurity measures across the Company for some time now.
"For 
example, we have an independent cybersecurity network in place across all regions and Group brands and 
monitor potential cyber risks."
This enables us to act fast when potential threats arise.
"Since June 2022, the 
UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) has provided for corresponding certification and 
homologation to ensure that companies can guarantee that these aspects are dealt with properly so as to 
protect the users of our vehicles from potential attacks."
"Our Group pursues the goal of implementing standards 
in the areas of both accident prevention and security."
"We are continuously refining the established processes 
within the framework of an Automotive Cyber Security Management System in keeping with the requirements of 
the UNECE regulation."
"In this context, Volkswagen is implementing comprehensive measures across depart-
ments throughout the Group."
"Strategy of Group Quality 
We review our functional area strategy New Quality periodically and coordinate it with the brands."
"We align our 
activities with our goal expressed in the new motto: “We strive for outstanding products, services and customer 
satisfaction.” The NEW AUTO Group strategy sets new parameters for transforming the Group into a software-
oriented mobility provider."
"Based on this, our quality strategy focuses primarily on achieving maximum levels of 
customer satisfaction throughout the entire customer experience – from ordering through to the digital eco-
system and up to the product as well as aftersales and customer service."
"Group Quality and the brands’ quality 
organizations play an active role at all stages of product emergence and testing, making an important contri-
bution to successful product launches, high customer satisfaction and low warranty and ex gratia repair costs."
"We have defined “warranty and ex gratia repair payments per vehicle after 12 months in service” as a strategic 
indicator at the top level of consideration for the major passenger car-producing brands."
"This shows all warranty 
and ex gratia repair payments for the vehicles produced worldwide in each production year, expressed in euros 
per vehicle."
"All vehicles from the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Škoda, 
SEAT/CUPRA, Audi and Porsche brands are included in this figure."
"Extraordinary items resulting from initiatives 
such as recalls to assure product safety or comply with laws are not taken into account."
"While the figures 
starting from the 2017 production year remained at a constant low level, they have increased since the 2020 
production year due to the growing use of new technologies in the vehicle and rising complexity."
"Actions were 
taken to reduce these figures and have proven effective."

Legal and regulatory compliance 
The legal and regulatory compliance of our products is paramount in our work."
"In our processes we employ the 
principle of multiple-party verification, which involves mutual support and control between the business units."
"Among other things, software development is accompanied by quality milestones at all brands."
"This principle 
applies to all systems, components and parts that directly influence a vehicle’s safety, type approval and func-
tioning and therefore require particular vigilance."
"At the series production stage, we see to it that the conformity 
checks on our products are carried out and assessed with the participation of all business units involved."
"This 
applies particularly to checks related to emissions and fuel consumption."
"We are also dedicating attention to our quality management system, reinforcing the interdisciplinary, pro-
cess-driven approach throughout the Group."
"The quality management system in the Volkswagen Group is based 
on the ISO 9001 standard and the official type approval requirements."
"These standards and requirements must 
be complied with for us to obtain type approval for the manufacture and sale of our vehicles."
"We conducted 
numerous system audits in the reporting year to verify that our sites and brands continue to comply with these 
requirements."
Particular focus was placed on assessing the risk of non-compliance with defined processes.
"Our 
quality management consultants pay attention to ensuring that these and other new requirements, as well as 
official regulations, are implemented and complied with; they are coordinated and supported in this endeavor by 
a central office in Group Quality."
"Observing regional requirements 
We use a variety of feedback instruments, such as specific customer surveys, to collect information on region-
specific customer requirements."
"In addition, we monitor relevant internet forums and social media postings 
worldwide to obtain direct customer feedback and identify sentiment and trends at an early stage."
"In order to be able to make the perceived quality of our vehicles commensurate with that of our competitors, 
we take the needs of our regional customers into account in our vehicle audits."
"Every brand works together with 
the individual regions to decide how its product is to be positioned there."
"In this way, we strengthen the brands’ 
responsibility."
"Consistent quality benchmarks apply across all brands and regions to ensure that we obtain 
comparable results from the vehicle audit."
We are continually adapting these in line with changing requirements.
"For more than 40 years now, we have been deploying auditors around the world to assess, from the customer’s 
perspective, the vehicles that are ready for delivery and to ensure that these vehicles comply with the 
benchmarks defined."

EMPLOYEES 
The Volkswagen Group is one of the world’s largest private employers."
"On December 31, 2023, we employed a 
total of 684,025 people, which includes the Chinese joint ventures."
"This figure represents a 1.2% increase com-
pared with the end of 2022."
"The ratio of Group employees in Germany to those abroad remained largely stable 
over the past year; at the end of 2023, 298,687 (293,862) employees worked in Germany."
"Human resources strategy and principles of the human resources policy  
For the Volkswagen Group the transformation of the workforce is defined as a focus topic in the Group’s NEW 
AUTO strategy."
We have also embedded the topic in our Group-wide “People & Transformation” initiative.
"The 
Group People Strategy Transform to Tech will play a key role in this context for our three brand groups – Core, 
Progressive and Sport Luxury."
"This strategy also enables the Volkswagen Group to continue with key, successful 
approaches in human resources policy."
"These include the pronounced stakeholder focus in corporate gover-
nance, comprehensive participation rights for employees, forward-looking training opportunities, the principle of 
long-term service through systematic employee retention and remuneration that is fair and transparent."
"At the same time, the Group People Strategy is setting innovative trends."
"Employee experience is to be 
improved systematically, the teams strengthened as the most important units in the company’s organization, and 
modern forms of working, such as agile methods, are to be developed."
"Our aim is to become more attractive as 
an employer and take the performance of our organization to the next level."
"In our Group People Strategy we have identified different dimensions with which we aim to address employ-
ees’ needs and expectations in a holistic manner."
"Together, these four dimensions make up the work experience, 
job satisfaction and, ultimately, the success of the work and the Group’s integration into society."
"1) “Me” (Me@Volkswagen): We strive to systematically improve the employee experience and ensure that all 
employees have the best possible conditions in which to do their job."
"2) „My team“ (Teams@Volkswagen): As our transformation takes shape, the way in which teams in the Volks-
wagen Group collaborate changes fundamentally."
"Hybrid, digital and agile forms of collaboration become more 
important."
"They require office environments and working methods to adapt and facilitate collaborative, flexible 
work."
The same applies to opportunities for digital collaboration.
"Our corporate culture aims to create 
a sense of belonging for our workforce – an important aspect that is gaining in significance particularly in 
times of change and in an increasingly diverse environment."
"We believe in the importance of fair remuneration, 
which underscores our image of ourselves as an attractive employer."
"It is designed to motivate and to express 
our appreciation for the performance of each individual."
"In addition, we need to empower our leaders to 
support the transformation in a goal-oriented way and act as role models."
"Group-wide activities such as team 
dialogue and the role model program are designed to encourage employees to discuss the Group Essentials 
and incorporate them into all work processes."
"In the role model program, managers from all brands strive to 
improve the corporate culture together with their staff."
We see our employees as representatives of the Volkswagen Group who communicate our values to society.
"Together with them, we also assume responsibility above and beyond our core business – such as through 
foundation work and corporate volunteering (employee engagement)."
"The topics of our social commitment 
range from education to culture, diversity, a culture of remembrance, climate action and environmental protec-
tion, and various local commitments."
The transformation has put us on a long-term path of change and renewal.
"It is important for us to regularly 
review whether we are maintaining the course we have set and achieving our objectives."
The opinion survey is conducted for the majority of our Group workforce.
"The target for 2025 is 89.1 out of a 
possible total of 100 index points."
"A score of 86.0 index points was achieved in the reporting year, meaning 
that the target for 2023 of 88.8 index points was missed."
86.6 points were achieved in the previous year.
"For 
Volkswagen AG, the score for 2023 was 84.7 (87.1) index points."
"In particular, this indicator underpins the objective of the Group People Strategy, which is aimed at 
contributing to an exemplary leadership and corporate culture."
"The proportion of women in management, 
comprised of management, senior management and top management (including Group Board of Management 
members), amounted to 19.2% in 2023 and was 1.9 percentage points up on the prior-year level."
"We aim to 
raise this figure to 20.2% by 2025."
"Our goal is to increase the level of internationalization in top management, 
the uppermost of our three management tiers, to 25.0% by 2025; in the past fiscal year this was 25.6 (23.4)%."
"The figures for the proportion of women in management and the internationalization of top management are 
placed equally weighted in the diversity index and the figures for the year 2016 set to an index value of 100."
For 2023 we had planned to increase this index to 142.
This target was exceeded with a score of 154 (140).

> Implementation status of strategic HR planning: Strategic HR planning supplements operational HR planning 
by adding a qualitative, long-term and strategic planning perspective."
"It allows business units to identify 
qualitative and quantitative surpluses and shortfalls at an early stage and develop necessary qualification, 
training and restructuring requirements designed to help support the transformation."
"To map progress in 
strategic HR planning, we measure the percentage of the active workforce considered in the strategic HR 
planning from 2023."
"The data collected showed a coverage of 34.3%, which was just under the target of 35%."
"> Number of training hours per employee: Due to the transformation in the automotive industry, we are facing the 
biggest process of expertise and cultural change in the history of the Group."
"As a result, individual oppor-
tunities for change for employees are becoming an increasingly important success factor."
"Through economies 
of scale in connection with digitalization and through use of the learning platform Degreed, which is to be 
gradually rolled out across the Group, Volkswagen is improving the access to training opportunities."
"The goal 
is to increase the average number of training hours per employee in the Volkswagen Group – based on the 
active workforce (excluding employees in the withdrawal phase of their time asset bonds) – by 35% by 2030 to 
30 hours per year."
"The baseline value is 22.3 hours and represents the average for the base years 2015 to 
2019."
"These years were chosen as the baseline due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which tempo-
rarily curtailed training activities in 2020 and 2021."
The target figure for the reporting year was 24.0 hours.
"With an average of 22.1 hours per employee, the target has not been met."
"Training and professional development 
At Volkswagen, our capacity for innovation and our competitive position largely depend on the commitment and 
knowledge of our employees, particularly during the transformation."
"Volkswagen Group employees have access to a wide range of training measures organized according to 
vocational groups."
"These comprise all employees whose tasks are based on similar technical skills and who 
require related expertise in order to perform their jobs."
"A skills profile lays down the specialist and interdisci-
plinary skills for each job and serves as a guide for training measures."
"Formats range from further training in 
general Company-related topics to specific training or personal development programs."
"Thanks to these oppor-
tunities, Volkswagen employees are able to further develop and steadily deepen their knowledge throughout 
their working lives."
The range of learning opportunities is being expanded continuously.
"Degreed, the innovative learning platform that we have implemented, opens up diverse training opportunities 
for our employees."
"The platform creates a simple, customized learning experience and is aimed at supporting the 
results of strategic HR planning with appropriate training programs."
"Another focus is developing important and 
specific skills, for example in areas such as data analytics, software development, leadership, machine learning 
and artificial intelligence."
"In addition, Volkswagen’s Faculty 73 program is providing in-house training for the 
software developers who are needed for the digital transformation."
"The graduates from this program largely 
work in departments at Group IT, brand IT, Technical Development and CARIAD."
"The fifth year of this innovative 
transformation program started in November 2023."
"The program is designed for employees and also external 
applicants with an affinity for IT and an interest in software development."
"Volkswagen AG, CARIAD and Škoda are also supporting the innovative programming schools in Wolfsburg, 
Berlin and Prague in cooperation with the non-profit École 42."
"In 2023, an average of 882 students in Berlin, 
Wolfsburg and Prague were learning from and with each other in this innovative training approach."

Vocational training and cooperative education 
The core components of training at Volkswagen are vocational training and cooperative education (dual study 
programs combining university studies with on-the-job training)."
"As of the end of 2023, the Volkswagen Group 
trained 17,081 young people."
"We have introduced the principle of dual vocational training at many of the Group’s 
international locations over the past few years and are continuously working on improvements."
"Once a year, 
Volkswagen honors its highest-achieving vocational trainees in the Group with the Best Apprentice Award."
"Even 
after their vocational training has been completed, young people at the start of their careers are encouraged to 
continue their professional development in our Company."
"Development of university graduates 
Volkswagen offers two structured entry and development programs for university graduates and young profess-
sionals."
"In the StartUp Direct trainee program, graduate trainees gain an overview of the Company while working 
in their own department and also take part in supplementary training measures."
"University graduates interested 
in working internationally can participate in the StartUp Cross program."
"The aim here is to get to know the Com-
pany in all its diversity and to build up a broad network."
"During their participation in the program, young pro-
fessionals become familiarized with several locations in Germany and other countries by working in various 
departments."
Both programs also include several weeks’ experience working in production.
"Increasing attractiveness as an employer and development programs for specific target groups  
A human resources policy that promotes a work-life balance is a major component of Volkswagen’s attract-
tiveness as an employer; in particular, it contributes to greater gender equality."
"We are working continuously to 
develop family-friendly working time models and to increase the number of women in management positions."
"For Volkswagen AG, we have also set targets for the proportion of women in management in accordance with 
German legislation."
"As of December 31, 2023, the proportion of women in the active workforce (excluding employees in 
the withdrawal phase of their time asset bonds) at the first level of management was 15.3% and at the second 
level of management it was 21.5%."
"The Group Board of Management and Supervisory Board are regularly informed 
of the figures achieved and the current target paths."
"This approach is supported by many different measures ranging from cross-brand mentoring 
programs to agreement on target quotas for the management selection procedure and targets for the share of 
women among external hires."
"The Group also has a large number of collective regulations in place to make it easier for employees to 
balance the demands and needs of work and home life and allow staff to arrange their own individual working 
model."
"“Meine AusZeit” is a program offered by Volkswagen AG that 
allows employees to take a self-financed leave of absence with an upfront payment from the Company."
"Hybrid working – a combination of remote working and working onsite – gives employees greater flexibility in 
terms of when and where they work and is increasingly becoming the norm for the Volkswagen Group."
"To 
strengthen collaboration between teams in this changed environment, we offer accompanying knowledge trans-
fer and training formats on the topic of virtual and hybrid collaboration."
The use of hybrid collaboration also poses new requirements for the design of office spaces.
"Against this 
backdrop, we are currently testing desk-sharing models in various office environments (for example at 
Volkswagen AG, Audi and Porsche) with the aim of designing more modern workplaces at Volkswagen."
"At 
production sites, too, we are investing in contemporary working environments."
"At our Wolfsburg site, for 
example, we are gradually modernizing several hundred social spaces, including with financial support from the 
modernization fund."
"Plants and departments can apply to the modernization fund, which distributes an average 
of €25 million each year."
"The fund has a total volume of €125 million, spread over five years."
"The Volkswagen Group attaches particular importance to its employees being able to act with agility and 
entrepreneurial drive."
"Together with 30 publicly traded large companies from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, 
we developed a skills matrix for training and professional development in the area of agile business processes 
under the umbrella of the DACH30 initiative."
"As part of these endeavors, the Volkswagen Group Academy set up 
an agility training portfolio."
"Preventive healthcare and occupational safety 
In addition to complying with legal requirements, we aim to protect and promote physical and mental health, 
taking into account psychosocial risks and their effects."
"We believe in providing employees with health care that 
is above the standard set by law in the country in question."

Employee participation 
Codetermination and employee participation are important pillars of our human resources strategy."
"Volkswagen 
aims to promote high levels of expertise and a strong sense of team spirit."
"This includes employees’ opinions, 
assessments and criticism being heard."
"We brief our employees extensively on upcoming changes so as to involve them in strategic decision-making 
as early as possible."
"When shaping labor relations to embody cooperation and social peace, we are guided by 
universal human rights and the standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO)."
"Building on these prin-
ciples, we have agreed various charters and declarations with the European and Global Group Works Council 
which set out the principles of labor policy in the Volkswagen Group as well as employee rights."
"Employee participation in the Company’s success through the issuance of treasury shares in the form of an 
employee share program is not currently offered."
"By means of the opinion survey (Stimmungsbarometer), the Company regularly gathers information regarding 
employee satisfaction and also surveys employees on our corporate culture."
"Based on the results, follow-up 
processes are implemented in which measures are developed and executed."
"The 2023 opinion survey covered 
129 companies in 48 countries."
"Of the 588,072 employees in the companies surveyed, 464,749 participated."
This was a participation rate of 79%.
"The sentiment rating calculated from 22 questions is the main parameter of 
the opinion survey and is used to help determine Board of Management remuneration, among other things."
"It is 
calculated from the total of all the related answers in the survey and, in 2023, stood at 82.5 out of a possible 
total of 100 index points."
"The score achieved in 2023 was thus just above the previous year’s figure, which 
amounted to 82.4 points."
"In addition, we also encourage employee involvement by means of Idea Management."
"Employees have the 
opportunity to put their creativity and knowledge to use by contributing their ideas for making improvements, 
thus contributing to streamlining workflows, further enhancing ergonomics in the workplace, reducing costs and 
continuously increasing efficiency."
The system also provides monetary incentives by offering set rewards.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT)  
The Volkswagen Group is continuing to drive its transformation into a provider of sustainable mobility."
"IT is playing 
an ever more important role in this – used in our vehicles, across the Company and in opening up new business 
models."
"Digitalized supply chains, automated and AI-optimized production processes, data-driven management of 
the sustainability targets and a seamless integration of analogue and digital customer experience are elements 
of this transformation."
"> Through agile development, the customer-centric development of IT products and digital services will facili-
tate continuous improvement and refinement and lead more swiftly to measurable business benefit."
"> The systematic use and provision of data across the entire organization to optimize products, processes and 
corporate governance."
"Data is set to become a value driver for innovations, new business models, personalized 
customer contact and better corporate management across all brands and companies, whilst adhering to the 
relevant and applicable data protection requirements."
"With the NEW IT strategy, the IT and data organization have been geared to the requirements of the coming 
years."
Sprints focused on business impact and speed will drive the IT strategy in a consistent direction.
"The 
introduction of a new agile product organization will significantly accelerate the development and provision of 
digital products."
"IT and the Board functions will work together on new digital products in cross-functional teams, 
taking an agile and customer-centric approach with short development cycles."
"Systematically modularizing 
large IT programs using such sprints will significantly reduce the complexity of these projects."
"This will not only 
make the projects more efficient and faster to implement but deliver results and business benefits sooner."
"The system-
atic identification and Group-wide sharing of best practices – projects that have already been successfully 
implemented at individual brands or companies – provides for effective knowledge transfer within the Company, 
conserves resources and generates greater speed and efficiency."
"Creating transparency around IT costs across 
the brands and therefore throughout the Group is an essential factor in making strategic decisions for the future."
A 50% reduction in the IT committee landscape also serves to accelerate this decision-making.
The availability of the IT infrastructure for all brands and companies is a high priority.
"The provision of state-
of-the-art IT applications for digital collaboration and the expansion of options for conducting business on 
mobile devices are designed to improve productivity in the long term."
"Building on the rollout of Microsoft 365, 
even more functions for simple, digital collaboration throughout the Group were implemented in the reporting 
year."
"Furthermore, the implementation of a comprehensive Group-wide data strategy enables the generation of 
overarching benefits through data-based solutions and artificial intelligence."
"The expansion of strategic IT 
partnerships and cross-brand partner and resource management also secures external capacity."

Software development 
The “IT” Board function is responsible for swiftly developing software and IT solutions for the Group based on the 
Group’s needs."
"Part of this development work takes place in the Software Development Centers (SDCs) around 
the world."
"The strategic goal is to safeguard and successively increase the proportion of in-house services relating 
to software products for critical business processes."
"The optimization of processes and the definition of standards for software development remain at the 
forefront of our activities."
"Among other things, this entails international, data-driven management of activities in 
the SDCs, strategic alignment of the business-critical enterprise systems in accordance with the NEW IT strategy 
and safeguarding intellectual property in the form of software product source codes."
"Use of digitalization and IT solutions  
The Board of Management continuously monitors and supports the digital transformation."
"The Group Board of 
Management Committee for Digital Transformation addresses the digital transformation of business processes 
across brands and business units."
"It manages the IT project portfolio and fosters the digital cultural change as 
well as innovations and synergies between the Group and the brands."
"Volkswagen embraces digitalization in the Company; its in-house Software Innovation Centers (SICs) are just 
one example of this."
"They act as centers of innovation and expertise, piloting new technologies with their know-
how to fulfill the requirements of the different business areas in the Group, developing applications relevant for 
the Company and making these available for productive use within the organization."
"Here, Group IT, research 
institutes, educational institutions (such as universities), technology partners and policymakers work closely 
together on future trends in information technology."
"The SICs also use their network with start-ups to adapt 
innovative solutions to Volkswagen’s needs."
"This allows the experience and strategic expertise of a large com-
pany like Volkswagen to be combined with the pragmatism, the innovative ideas for new areas of business and 
the speed of young start-ups."
"Highly specialized experts at the Data:Lab in Munich and Wolfsburg are involved in machine learning and AI 
solutions that have great potential, for example in production, logistics and quality assurance."
"The objective is 
improved human-machine collaboration to optimize processes, minimize errors and automate possible repetitive 
tasks, freeing up capacity for more valuable work."
"In the medium and long term, the aim is to enable cost 
savings, increased product quality and improved competitiveness."
"The focus is on innovation projects such as Smart Quality Analytics (SQA) – an IT system used among other 
things to digitalize the analysis of field data."
"For quality assurance purposes, SQA records and analyzes the data 
from connected customer vehicles."
"This includes data from control units as well as error messages from 
workshops."
"Other projects are working on optimizing the order of individual working steps in vehicle 
manufacture (for example a painting sequence) to reduce production times and improve the use of resources."
"In the field of machine learning, work is being carried out on smart management of energy use to generate 
sustainable energy savings and CO2 reductions, for example in compressed air control systems."
"In addition, the 
SDCs are used to transfer knowledge throughout the entire Company on topics such as advanced data analytics 
(process for the systematic analysis of data in electronic form) and block chain (distributed ledger technologies) 
to make these new technologies available to the Group."
"Advanced data analytics are helping to optimize the 
storage of replacement parts in the after-sales business, for example."
"Likewise, numerous bot projects are being 
implemented to automate business processes (robotic process automation)."

Production processes are also safeguarded by artificial intelligence and camera systems (computer vision)."
"The 
systems and equipment in the factories are linked together in an integrated overall system."
"In conjunction with 
the different departments, Group IT is also contributing its expertise to the field of research and development, 
one example being EU projects."
"Digitalized work tools such as the “virtual concept vehicle” make the product 
development process faster, more efficient and more cost-effective, for example by replacing physical compo-
nents with virtual components generated on the computer."
"IT security 
Safeguarding data and information throughout the Volkswagen Group worldwide is one of the main tasks of IT 
and was continued in fiscal year 2023 with the Group Information Security Program."
"The objective of the pro-
gram is to create uniform processes and solutions across the Group to further enhance information security."
"The 
findings and solutions are being implemented within the Group successively."
"The main focus is on topics that 
could one day pose information security risks for the Group and that need to be specially safeguarded as part of 
the Group’s digital transformation strategy."
"The program’s content and orientation are reviewed annually and 
updated if necessary."
"We are one of the first vehicle manufacturers to require our suppliers to have passed TISAX (Trusted Infor-
mation Security Assessment Exchange) certification."
"This sends out a signal regarding the security of cross-
company information and data."
"TISAX certification is an assessment method developed by the German Associ-
ation of the Automotive Industry and is based on the international industry standard and the requirements of the 
automotive world."
The aim is for sensitive data and information to be dealt with securely by our suppliers.
"The task of automotive cybersecurity is to avert cyberattacks on our vehicles throughout the entire product 
life cycle, as well as on the digital vehicle ecosystem."
"The Group policies in the Volkswagen Group based on the 
legal requirements of the UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) regulation have been imple-
mented."
"Brand-specific organizational guidelines are being specified and implemented on this basis, taking the 
organizational circumstances into account."
"To protect our customers against cyberattacks, and to implement our solutions in conformity with national 
and international legislation, we have established integrated, cross-brand, cross-regional security management 
systems for information and cybersecurity."
"The cybersecurity management system required by UNECE Regula-
tion 155 received UNECE CSMS certification in 2021 and undergoes annual monitoring audits (most recently in 
mid-2023)."
"Safeguarding the complete life cycle of our vehicles and digital mobility services has been part of 
standard operations since 2022."
"Key central information security processes have been audited and certified in line with the international ISO 
27001 framework."
"This is the most important cross-sectoral standard for information security and is our basis for 
building an appropriate information security management system for handling all sensitive information in the 
Group."
This information security management system is being gradually expanded.
"It is audited annually and 
recertified at required intervals."
"In recent years, the introduction of the data protection management system and the data protection manage-
ment organization has thus established the infrastructure for implementing and complying with data protection 
requirements at Volkswagen AG in the long term."
"Continuously raising awareness among the workforce and further standard-
izing and automating processes remain the focus of activities."
"Compliance requirements are already being 
integrated into the design of IT solutions and infrastructure decisions."
"REPORT ON POST BALANCE SHEET DATE EVENTS 
There were no significant events after the end of fiscal year 2023."
The finance sector is expected to make an important contribution to realizing this objective.
"In this 
context, the EU published the “Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy” in 2021."
"Aimed at 
supporting the financing of the transition to a sustainable economy, the published strategy contains proposals 
relating to transition finance, inclusiveness, resilience and contribution of the financial system, and global ambi-
tion."
It is based on the EU’s action plan on Financing Sustainable Growth of 2018.
"In addition to “Disclosures” 
and “Tools”, another key module is the EU Taxonomy (Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and associated delegated acts)."
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system for sustainable economic activities.
"An activity is only considered environmentally sustainable, i.e."
"taxonomy-aligned, if it meets all three of the fol-
lowing conditions: 
> The activity makes a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives by meeting the screening 
criteria defined for this economic activity, e.g."
"level of CO2 emissions for the climate change mitigation environ-
mental objective."
> The activity meets the Do-No-Significant-Harm (DNSH) criteria defined for this economic activity.
"These are 
designed to prevent significant harm to one or more of the other environmental objectives, e.g."
"from the pro-
duction process or by the product."
"> The activity is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards, which apply to all economic activities 
and relate primarily to human rights and social and labor standards."
"EU Taxonomy 
Doing business in an environmentally sustainable way is one of the central challenges  
of our time."
"The EU has defined criteria for determining the degree of a company's 
environmental sustainability."
"With our taxonomy-aligned investments in development 
activities and in property, plant and equipment, we are today already shaping the future  
in an environmentally sustainable way as envisaged by the EU Taxonomy."
"197 
EU Taxonomy
Group Management Report 
The Volkswagen Group supports the EU’s overarching goal."
"We are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement 
and align our own activities with the 1.5 degree goal."
We aim to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050.
"REPORTING FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 
The Volkswagen Group is required by the EU Taxonomy to report on all of the environmental objectives for the 
first time in fiscal year 2023."
"The figures reported on sales revenue, capital expen-
diture and operating expenditure relate to the companies consolidated in the Volkswagen Group’s financial 
statements."
Volumes and financial data for our Chinese joint ventures are therefore excluded.
"The wording and terminology used in the EU Taxonomy are still subject to some uncertainty in interpretation, 
which could lead to changes in the reporting when it is subsequently clarified by the EU."
"Ultimately, there is a 
risk that the key performance indicators presented as taxonomy-aligned would need to be assessed differently."
Our interpretation is set out below.
"ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
With the Group strategy “NEW AUTO – Mobility for generations to come”, we are preparing ourselves for the 
global changes in mobility and thus playing a substantial role in driving Volkswagen’s transformation into a 
provider of sustainable mobility."
"In this context, we pay particular attention to the use of resources and the emis-
sions of our product portfolio, as well as those of our sites."
"The Volkswagen Group’s activities in its vehicle-related business with passenger cars, light commercial 
vehicles, trucks, buses and motorcycles cover the development, production and sale of vehicles and extend to 
our financial services and other vehicle-related products and services."
"Activities in these areas are suited under 
the EU Taxonomy to making a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of climate change miti-
gation by increasing clean or climate-neutral mobility."
"The Volkswagen Group’s activities in the Power Engineering Business Area comprise the development, 
design, production, sale and servicing of machinery and equipment."
"These activities also fall under the environ-
mental objective of climate change mitigation."
"An analysis of our economic activities in the context of the EU Taxonomy has not revealed any activities that 
contribute specifically to one of the other five environmental objectives."
"The table below sets out the allocation of our activities in the vehicle-related business and in Power Engi-
neering to the economic activities listed in the EU Taxonomy under the environmental objective of climate 
change mitigation."
"Changes may be made to the economic activities in future as the rules around the EU 
Taxonomy dynamically evolve."

substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions 
in other sectors of the economy, where those 
technologies do not fall under other economic 
activities in the manufacturing sector."
"Power Engineering 
3.18 Manufacture of automotive and mobility 
components 
Manufacture, repair, maintenance, retrofitting, 
repurposing and upgrade of automotive and 
mobility systems and components that are 
essential for delivering and improving the 
environmental performance of the vehicle."
"Vehicle-related business 
9."
"This includes all pas-
senger cars, light commercial vehicles, trucks, buses and motorcycles manufactured by us, irrespective of their 
powertrain technology, and also includes genuine parts."
"In our vehicle-related business, we have detailed the vehicles manufactured by us by model and powertrain 
technology and analyzed the CO2 emissions associated with them in accordance with the current regulations."
"In 
this way, we have identified those vehicles among all of our taxonomy-eligible vehicles that meet the screening 
criteria and with which the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation is measured."
"These include all 
of the Volkswagen Group’s all-electric vehicles (BEVs)."
"Until December 31, 2025, they also include passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles with CO2 emissions of less than 50 g/km in accordance with the WLTP."
"This encom-
passes the majority of our plug-in hybrids."
"Buses meeting the Euro 6 standard (Stage E) were also included until 
December 31, 2022."
"Economic activity 3.18 Manufacture of automotive and mobility components 
This economic activity was added to the EU Taxonomy in the reporting period to enable those components that 
play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions also to be taken into account."
"To this activity, we allocate 
the sale to third parties of motors and powertrains produced by us for all-electric vehicles; this primarily com-
prises the sale of these components to our Chinese joint ventures."
"This is because, as the rules of the EU Taxonomy currently stand, it is 
still unclear where to record them in accordance with the EU Taxonomy."
"These activities particularly include the 
sale of additional engines and powertrains, as well as parts deliveries, the sale of non-Group products and 
production under license by third parties."
"This approach has 
been verified for some first projects by an independent third party and will be extended to other applications in 
future."
"Economic activity 3.2 Manufacture of equipment for the production and use of hydrogen 
Our activities in relation to the manufacture of equipment for the production of hydrogen are taxonomy-eligible: 
they include the electrolyzers we manufacture and the complete hydrogen systems we build."
"To meet the 
substantial contribution criteria, evidence of the life-cycle GHG emissions of the hydrogen later produced by the 
equipment’s user must also be provided."
This depends on the source of the energy used for electrolysis.
"The manufacture of equipment for the use of hydrogen, which is required for a hydrogen-based supply of 
energy and raw materials, makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation."
"This equipment includes 
the compressors we manufacture for the transport, compression, or liquefaction of hydrogen, tanks and equip-
ment for the storage of hydrogen, and reactors and equipment for processing hydrogen into hydrogen-based 
synthetic fuels."
"Economic activity 3.6 Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies 
The description of this economic activity means that only those technologies manufactured for the purpose of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions substantially in other sectors of the economy are taxonomy-eligible."
"At 
Volkswagen, this comprises all new-build activities that enable the use of gas and climate-neutral synthetic 
fuels (e.g."
"manufacturing of gas and dual-fuel engines), all industrial solutions for energy storage and sector 
coupling (e.g."
"heat pumps) and all carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology."
"These activities are 
rounded off by the service and after-sales business, comprising the upgrading and modernization of existing 
equipment."
"For example, we retrofit existing maritime fleets with technology that makes it possible to reduce 
CO2 emissions."
"To count as a substantial contribution to economic activity 3.6, we must demonstrate that the use of the 
product reported here enables substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings compared to the best-performing 
alternative available on the market."
"Examining the life-cycle GHG emissions of the product itself does not 
suffice; the difference from the emissions of the alternative technology must also be calculated and evaluated."
"For this purpose, we apply the systematic method based on parameters that is used to calculate life-cycle GHG 
emissions to the CCUS industrial solutions, large-scale heat pumps, energy storage systems and paper industry 
applications manufactured by us."
"200 
EU Taxonomy
Group Management Report 
Economic activity 9.1 Close to market research, development and innovation 
The description of this economic activity includes applied research in technologies for the reduction or avoid-
ance of greenhouse gas emissions."
We allocate our licensing business to this economic activity.
"In the course of 
such business we provide our development services in the form of production documents, based on which our 
licensees are authorized to manufacture corresponding gas and/or dual-fuel engines."
"Of the approximately 40 sites 
included, the majority are located in the EU, with some in the United Kingdom, Türkiye, South Africa, the USA, 
Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, China and India."
"We also included the sites that manufacture specific components for 
electric vehicles."
"These comprise five sites in Germany, one in Switzerland and one in Sweden."
The wording and terminology used in the EU Taxonomy are subject to some uncertainty in interpretation.
"To 
some extent, the Taxonomy goes beyond the regulations to be applied in regular business operations."
"In addition, 
the application of the EU Taxonomy to sites outside the EU leads to particular challenges due to the possibility of 
diverging legislation."
"Below, we set out our interpretation and describe the main analyses we used to examine 
whether there was any significant harm to the other environmental objectives."
"Climate change adaptation  
We performed a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify which production sites may be affected by 
physical climate risks."
"The physical climate risks we identified were assessed on the basis of the lifetime of the 
relevant fixed asset."
"Volkswagen’s climate-based DNSH assessment is based on the Representative Concentration Pathway 
(RCP8.5) and on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP5-8.5) scenario to the year 2050 and thus assumes the 
highest concentration of CO2 according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."
"The relevance 
of the identified threats was assessed for the local environment and, if appropriate, the measures needed to 
mitigate the risk were developed."
"Risks identified in an EIA are examined during the 
approval process and, if relevant, result in measures and regulatory requirements."
"We based the analysis pri-
marily on ISO 14001 certificates, information from site approvals and other external data sources related to sites 
with a high risk exposure."
"Transition to a circular economy  
Environmentally compatible waste management in the manufacturing process, reuse and use of secondary raw 
materials and a long product lifespan are major aspects of Volkswagen’s environmental management system."
"Volkswagen defines guidelines on the circular economy in its environmental principles, in its overall factory 
white paper and in its goTOzero strategy."
"The product-related requirements for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are taken into account 
through implementation of the statutory end-of-life vehicle requirements in conjunction with the type approval 
of the vehicle models."
"In addition to this, each brand has targets and measures for the use of recycled materials 
in new vehicles."
"For trucks and buses, a review was conducted at the level of each brand to establish the extent to which local 
legislation or internal rules and regulations cover the specific requirements."
"In the Power Engineering Business Area, a major lever for the circular economy can be found particularly in a 
long product lifespan, supported among other things by our retrofitting business."
"Pollution prevention and control  
To be considered environmentally sustainable, an economic activity may not significantly increase air, water or 
soil pollutant emissions as compared with the situation before the activity started."
"Overall, the automotive sector is already tightly regulated, as demonstrated for example by the publicly 
accessible Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL)."
"Approval and monitoring processes have 
been implemented with the aim of ensuring compliance with the legal requirements and internal rules and 
regulations applicable to regular business operations."
"In this context, we also already consider the use of alter-
native substances in our analyses and assessments."
"In July 2023, the European Commission revised the DNSH criterion of the EU Taxonomy."
"There is room for 
interpretation as to the effect that the changed requirements will have on internal processes related to the 
assessment of substitution options for substances of very high concern (SVHC) in the 2023 reporting year."
"In the vehicle-related business, standards and processes stipulating in principle that SVHCs should be 
avoided and substituted are already in place."
"We use pilot projects to test the processes 
and documentation for assessing substitution options in accordance with the amended EU Taxonomy require-
ments."
"It has not yet been possible to verify whether the sites of the truck and bus brands that operate only 
outside the European Economic Area comply with the new regulations due to factors such as the inadequate 
lead time for implementation."
"In the Power Engineering Business Area, the corresponding processes include surveys relating to the substi-
tution assessments and guidelines for performing these assessments."
"202 
EU Taxonomy
Group Management Report 
Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems."
"In order to verify adherence to the requirements on biodiversity and ecosystems, the relevant areas were 
identified."
"Where biodiversity-sensitive areas are located close to a production site, we checked whether a 
nature conservation assessment had been performed and whether nature conservation measures had been 
defined in the environmental approvals and subsequently implemented."
"We also checked whether changes had 
occurred in an area’s conservation status."
"MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS 
The minimum safeguards consist of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) and the International Bill of Human Rights."
"The assessments confirm that we meet the 
requirements of the minimum safeguards in the reporting year."
"As a business with a global presence, the Volkswagen Group accepts its corporate responsibility for human 
rights, fully recognizes these conventions and declarations and reaffirms its agreement with the contents and 
principles stated therein."
"In 2022, the Volkswagen Group appointed a Human Rights Officer, whose duties relate 
primarily to monitoring, checking and advising within the meaning of the Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz 
(LkSG – German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act)."
"The LkSG imposes certain due diligence obligations designed to avoid risks associated with human rights 
and the environment."
"These obligations include the performance of risk analyses, the integration of preventive 
measures, remedial measures and the provision of a complaints mechanism."
"The due diligence obligations apply 
both to the Volkswagen Group's own business area and to the Group's supply chain."
"In the reporting year, the 
departments responsible performed a risk analysis using questionnaire-based surveys of the Group companies 
of the Volkswagen Group's own business area; this included all sites that were also examined under the DNSH 
criteria."
"The companies were given risk-specific measures to counteract the risks identified in the analysis, and 
were required to implement these."
"For risks that are already known, we have begun to revise and initiate 
preventive measures and to supplement these with other measures where appropriate."
"The status of 
implementation of the respective measures is continuously monitored by the Group."
"If infringements of the 
frameworks are identified, remedial measures must be initiated and checked for their effectiveness."
"Relationships with our business partners are based on agreements such as the Code of Conduct for Business 
Partners."
"We review compliance by the relevant suppliers with the binding requirements defined in the Code 
using sustainability ratings."
"We address existing sustainability risks and violations of sustainability principles by 
systematically defining and allocating packages of measures to correct the violations; we also apply this 
approach to the upstream supply chain."
"In addition, we also conducted training for suppliers and on-site audits 
at suppliers with a high risk exposure in the reporting period."
"We implemented a Human-Rights-Focus-System in 
2022 to comply with international frameworks and requirements and specifically the LkSG."
"The system aims to 
identify particularly high risks in our supply chain in connection with human rights violations and the 
environment and to manage these appropriately."
"KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EU TAXONOMY REGULATION 
The EU Taxonomy defines sales revenue, capital expenditure and operating expenditure as the key performance 
indicators that must be reported on."
"The tables required by the EU Taxonomy are 
included at the end of the section."
"The financial figures relevant for the Volkswagen Group are taken from the IFRS consolidated financial state-
ments for fiscal year 2023."
"As we differentiate between economic activities, we have avoided double counting."
"Where possible, the figures within an economic activity have been allocated directly."
"In our vehicle-related 
business, for example, we compiled the financial figures based on the vehicle model and powertrain technology."
"This applies both to the vehicles themselves and to the corresponding financial services and other services and 
activities."
"Only where this was not possible for capital expenditure and operating expenditure were allocation

formulas used based on the planned vehicle volumes."
"In the Power Engineering Business Area, we used allo-
cation formulas based on planned sales revenue."
"This data and planning form part of the medium-term financial 
planning for the next five years on which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board have passed a 
resolution."
"Sales revenue 
The definition of turnover in the EU Taxonomy corresponds to the sales revenue reported in the IFRS consoli-
dated financial statements."
"This amounted to €322.3 billion in fiscal year 2023 (see also note on “Sales revenue” 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements; the prior-year figures were adjusted – see disclosures on 
IFRS 17)."
"Of this total, €294.0 billion, or 91.2% of Group sales, was attributable to economic activity 3.3 Manufacture of 
low-carbon technologies for transport, and was classified as taxonomy-eligible."
"Economic activity 3.18 Manufacture of automotive and mobility components accounted for taxonomy-
eligible sales revenue of €165 million or 0.1% of Group sales."
"This includes the sale of all-electric vehicle motors 
and powertrains to third parties."
"Of the taxonomy-eligible sales revenue from economic activity 3.3 Manufacture of low-carbon technologies 
for transport, €36.6 billion met the screening criteria used to measure the substantial contribution to climate 
change mitigation."
This includes all of our all-electric vehicles and a large proportion of our plug-in hybrids.
"In 
2023, there were 799 thousand such vehicles, around one third more than in the previous year."
"Their share of the 
relevant sales volume – excluding the vehicles from the Chinese joint ventures – rose to 12.7 (11.1)%."
"Passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles made up the bulk at 797 thousand vehicles; trucks and buses were down 
compared with the previous year, when buses that met the requirements of the Euro-6 E standard were still 
counted."
Sales of all-electric vehicles (BEV) increased very sharply compared with the prior year.
"In addition, the 
taxonomy-eligible sales revenue from economic activity 3.18 Manufacture of automotive and mobility compo-
nents met the screening criteria used to measure the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation."
"Taking into account the DNSH criteria and minimum safeguards, €36.5 (26.1) billion of the sales revenue 
generated from our vehicle-related business, equating to 11.3 (9.4)% of consolidated sales revenue, was 
taxonomy-aligned."
"Of this figure, €165 million related to economic activity 3.18 Manufacture of automotive and 
mobility components, which is being reported for the first time, while €27.8 billion or 8.6% of consolidated sales 
revenue was attributable to our BEV models."
"In the Power Engineering Business Area, our activities that fall under economic activity 3.2 Manufacture of 
equipment for the production and use of hydrogen generated completely taxonomy-aligned sales revenue of 
€28 million (previous year: €18 million)."
"The increase in taxonomy-aligned sales revenue is attributable to the 
expansion of the business."
"Most of our taxonomy-eligible sales revenue in the Power Engineering Business Area 
was attributable to economic activity 3.6 Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies (€3.1 billion), 
€68 million of which is taxonomy-aligned."
"In the reporting year, the complex evidential requirements were 
fulfilled for a portion of the activities for the first time."
"A further €58 million was contributed to taxonomy-eligible 
sales revenue by economic activity 9.1 Close to market research, development and innovation."
"Of the Volkswagen Group’s total sales revenue in fiscal year 2023, 
> €297.4 (256.9) billion, or 92.3 (92.0)%, was taxonomy-eligible sales revenue and 
> €36.6 (26.1) billion, or 11.4 (9.4)%, was taxonomy-aligned sales revenue."

"These are reported in the notes to the 2023 consolidated financial state-
ments in the notes on “Intangible assets”, “Property, plant and equipment” and “Lease assets and investment prop-
erty”."
"Additions from business combinations, each of which is reported under “Changes in consolidated Group”, 
are also included."
"By contrast, additions to goodwill are not included in the calculation."
"In fiscal year 2023, additions in the Volkswagen Group as defined above amounted to 
> €12.3 billion from intangible assets,
> €14.8 billion from property, plant and equipment and
> €33.0 billion from lease assets (mainly vehicle leasing business) and investment property."
"Other additions to be included resulted from changes in the consolidated Group, amounting to €1.4 billion in
fiscal year 2023."
"Total capital expenditure to be included in accordance with the EU Taxonomy therefore came to
€61.5 billion."
"All capital expenditure attributable to our vehicle-related business is associated with economic activity 3.3 
Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport."
"Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure for the vehicle-
related business amounted to €61.1 billion, or 99.4% of the Group’s capital expenditure."
"To determine the substantial contribution in the vehicle-related business, we compiled the financial figures 
based on the vehicle model and powertrain technology in the same way as for sales revenue."
"Where possible, 
capital expenditure was directly attributed to vehicles."
"It was included if the vehicles in question make a 
substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective."
"Any capital expenditure directly attributable 
to vehicles that do not meet the screening criteria was not included."
"Capital expenditure that was not clearly 
attributable to a particular vehicle was taken into account on a proportionate basis using allocation formulas."
"In 
our vehicle-related business, we developed allocation formulas based on planned vehicle volumes for the Group 
companies."
"In the sales companies, for example, we used allocation formulas related either to individual brands 
or to all brands, depending on the primary business activity, while site-based allocation formulas were used for 
production companies."
"This means that capital expenditure was counted in full via the allocation formulas for 
sites that according to our medium-term planning will produce only vehicles meeting the screening criteria for 
the substantial contribution in the next five years."
"In contrast, capital expenditure on sites that only produce 
vehicles not meeting the screening criteria was not counted under the allocation formula."
"Calculated in this way, 
capital expenditure relating to vehicles that meet the screening criteria for the substantial contribution 
amounted to €20.1 billion."
"Taking into account the DNSH criteria and minimum safeguards, capital expenditure of €20.0 (16.9) billion 
was taxonomy-aligned."
This represented 32.6 (34.5) % of the Group’s total capital expenditure.
"Of this figure, 
€5.9 billion was attributable to intangible assets, €6.3 billion to property, plant and equipment and €7.9 billion to 
lease assets and investment property."
"The figure includes additions to capitalized development costs of 
€4.9 billion and additions to property, plant and equipment of €6.1 billion for our all-electric vehicles (BEV)."
"The 
increase in taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure of €3.1 billion is attributable to the growing number of environ-
mentally sustainable vehicle projects under the EU Taxonomy."
"In the reporting period, we refinanced taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure from fiscal years 2021 and 2022 
based on the Green Finance Framework updated in October 2022 by issuing green bonds in the amount of 
€3.5 billion."
Only capital expenditure in connection with all-electric vehicles was included here.
"206 
EU Taxonomy
Group Management Report 
In 2022, Scania issued a green bond totaling SEK 3.0 billion to finance research and development activities 
relating to all-electric vehicles."
"The remaining €91 million was used in the reporting period; of this amount, 
€46 million was attributable to taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure."
"Adjusted for this figure, taxonomy-aligned 
capital expenditure attributable to the vehicle-related business accounted for 32.5 (34.3)% of total capital 
expenditure in accordance with the EU Taxonomy."
"For the latter, capital 
expenditure was broken down based on planned sales revenue."
"Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure for the manufacture of equipment for the production and use of 
hydrogen was disclosed in the amount of €37 million, half of which was attributable to intangible assets and half 
to property, plant and equipment."
"Capital expenditure amounting to €24 million for the manufacture of other 
low-carbon technologies was disclosed as taxonomy-aligned, more than 90% of this was attributable to 
property, plant and equipment."
"Of the Volkswagen Group’s total capital expenditure in fiscal year 2023,

"the sum of capital and operating expenditures expected to be incurred in the reporting 
period and during the five-year medium-term planning in order to expand taxonomy-aligned economic activities 
or allow taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become taxonomy-aligned."
"For the vehicle-related business, the CapEx plan drawn up under the EU Taxonomy relates to economic activity 
3.3 Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport within the climate change mitigation environmental 
objective."
"Additions from lease assets (mainly vehicle leasing business) are based on existing environmentally sustain-
able activities and have therefore not been included in the CapEx plan."
"As a result, €8 (9) billion of the taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure and €3 (3) billion of the taxonomy-
aligned operating expenditure in the reporting period is attributable to the CapEx plan under the EU Taxonomy."

Group Management Report 
In the following, we describe the expected development of the Volkswagen Group and the general framework for 
its business activities."
"Risks and opportunities that could represent a departure from the forecast trends are 
presented in the Report on Risks and Opportunities."
Our assumptions are based on current estimates by third-party institutions.
"These include economic research 
institutes, banks, multinational organizations and consulting firms."
"DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
Our planning is based on the assumption that global economic output will grow overall in 2024 compared with 
2023, albeit at a slower pace."
"The persistently high inflation in major economic regions and the resulting restric-
tive monetary policy measures taken by central banks are expected to continue to dampen consumer demand."
"We continue to believe that risks will arise from protectionist tendencies, turbulence in the financial markets and 
structural deficits in individual countries."
"In addition, continuing geopolitical tensions and conflicts are weighing 
on growth prospects; risks are associated in particular with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in 
the Middle East."
"We assume that both the advanced economies and the emerging markets will show positive 
momentum on average, but with below-average growth in gross domestic product (GDP)."
We also expect the global economy to recover in 2025 and continue a path of stable growth until 2028.
"Europe/Other Markets 
In Western Europe, we expect a comparatively low rate of economic growth in 2024."
"The relatively high overall 
level of inflation, albeit projected to taper off further as the year goes on, poses a major challenge for consumers 
and companies alike, as do the relatively high interest rates."
"It is therefore possible that the European Central 
Bank (ECB) might make the first cuts in key rates of interest as early as 2024 to support the eurozone economy."
"We likewise anticipate a higher growth rate compared with the prior year in Central Europe in 2024 with 
continuing but less dynamic price increases."
"Meanwhile, economic output in Eastern Europe should recover 
further following the heavy slump in 2022 as a result of the Russia Ukraine conflict and the relatively strong 
increase in 2023."
"For Türkiye we expect positive, albeit slower GDP growth than in the reporting year given high inflation and a 
weak local currency."
"The South African economy will probably be characterized by political uncertainty and

social tensions again in 2024 resulting from high unemployment, among other factors."
"Growth is expected to be 
higher than in the previous year but remain at a low level."
"Germany 
We expect only low growth in GDP in Germany in 2024."
"Meanwhile, averaged over the year, we anticipate that 
inflation will fall further but remain relatively high."
The labor market situation is likely to deteriorate.
"North America 
We anticipate subdued economic growth in the USA in 2024, accompanied by a worsening labor market 
situation."
"Similarly to the ECB, it is possible that the US Federal Reserve might start cutting its key interest rate 
as early as 2024."
"Further inflationary trends will play a decisive role in possible adjustments to the key rate, as 
will developments in the labor market and in the general economic situation."
"Economic growth in Canada is 
likely to be at a relatively low level, while economic output in Mexico is expected to expand at a somewhat faster 
pace by comparison."
"South America 
In all probability, the Brazilian economy will record a slightly positive rate of growth in 2024."
"In Argentina, 
economic output is likely to deteriorate further with very high and rising inflation levels and depreciation of the 
local currency."
"Asia-Pacific 
The Chinese economy is expected to grow at a relatively high level in 2024, albeit at a somewhat lower rate than 
in the reporting year."
"We likewise expect a relatively high rate of positive GDP growth for the Indian economy in 
2024."
Japan is expected to post only low growth in economic output.
"TRENDS IN THE MARKETS FOR PASSENGER CARS AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES 
The trend in the automotive industry closely follows global economic developments."
"We assume that competi-
tion in the international automotive markets will intensify further."
"Crisis-related disruption to the global supply 
chain and the resulting impact on vehicle availability may weigh on the volume of new registrations."
"Uncertainty 
may also arise from shortages of intermediates and commodities."
"These may be further exacerbated by the con-
sequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle East and may, in particular, lead to 
rising prices for materials and a declining availability of energy."
"We predict that trends in the markets for passenger cars in the individual regions will be mixed but pre-
dominantly positive in 2024."
"Overall, the global volume of new car sales is expected to be slightly higher than in 
the previous year."
"We are forecasting growing demand for passenger cars worldwide in the period from 2025 to 
2028."
"Trends in the markets for light commercial vehicles in the individual regions will be mixed; on the whole, we 
expect the sales volume for 2024 to be slightly above the previous year’s figure."
"For the years 2025 to 2028, we 
expect demand for light commercial vehicles to increase globally."
"Europe/Other Markets 
For 2024, we anticipate that the volume of new passenger car registrations in Western Europe will be slightly 
higher than that recorded in the reporting year."
"Limited vehicle availability as a result of the shortages of inter-
mediates and commodities may continue to weigh on the volume of new registrations."
"For the major individual 
markets of France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain, we expect growth in 2024 to varying degrees between 
slight and noticeable."
"Report on Expected Developments

For light commercial vehicles, we expect the volume of new registrations in Western Europe in 2024 to be 
noticeably up on the previous year’s level."
"Limited vehicle availability as a result of the shortages of intermedi-
ates and commodities may continue to weigh on the volume of new registrations."
"We expect a noticeable to 
significant increase in France and the United Kingdom."
"In Italy, we anticipate that registrations will fall slightly, 
whereas we expect slight growth in Spain."
"Sales of passenger cars in 2024 are expected to significantly exceed the prior-year figures overall in markets 
in Central and Eastern Europe – subject to the further development of the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
"We expect a 
mixed development in the major markets of this region."
"Subject to the further development of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, registrations of light commercial vehicles 
in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe are expected to fall slightly short of the prior-year figures in 2024."
"The volume of new registrations for passenger cars in Türkiye in 2024 is projected to fall considerably short of 
the previous year’s high level."
"In South Africa, the market volume is likely to be up noticeably year-on-year."
"The volume of new registrations for light commercial vehicles in 2024 is expected to fall very sharply in 
Türkiye but to be noticeably above the prior-year figure in South Africa."
"Germany 
In the German passenger car market, we expect the volume of new registrations in 2024 to be slightly up on the 
prior-year level."
"We anticipate that the number of registrations of light commercial vehicles in 2024 will also be slightly up on 
the previous year’s figure."
"North America 
The sales volume in the markets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (up to 6.35 tonnes) in North 
America overall and in the USA in 2024 is forecast to be slightly higher than the level seen in the previous year."
Demand will probably remain highest for models in the SUV and pickup segments.
"New registrations of all-
electric vehicles are also expected to increase strongly."
"In Canada, too, a slight increase is expected in the 
number of new registrations compared to the previous year."
"For Mexico, we also expect a slight increase in new 
registrations compared with the reporting year."
"South America 
Owing to their dependence on demand for raw materials worldwide, the South American markets for passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles are heavily influenced by developments in the global economy."
"We anticipate 
a slight increase overall in new registrations in the South American markets in 2024 compared with the previous 
year."
The market volume in Brazil is expected to increase noticeably compared with 2023.
"We anticipate that the 
volume of new registrations in Argentina will be slightly lower year-on-year."
"Asia-Pacific 
The passenger car markets in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to be slightly up on the prior-year level in 
2024."
"We estimate that the market volume in China will also be slightly higher than the comparative figure for 
2023."
Plug-in hybrid models with long ranges are likely to be increasingly in demand.
"A weaker than expected 
economic recovery or worsening geopolitical tensions may have adverse effects."
"In particular, the trade dispute 
between China and the United States is likely to continue to weigh on business and consumer confidence, as 
long as there is no resolution in sight."
"We project that the Indian and Japanese markets will remain at the prior-
year level."
"The volume of new registrations for light commercial vehicles in the Asia-Pacific region in 2024 will probably 
be slightly higher than the previous year’s figure."
"We are expecting demand in the Chinese market to be slightly 
lower than the prior-year level."
"For India, we are forecasting that the volume in 2024 will be on a level with the 
reporting year."
"In the Japanese market, we estimate that volumes will be slightly lower year-on-year."
"A noticeable decline in the market is expected in the 27 EU countries excluding Malta, but plus the United 
Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland (EU27+3)."
"A large part of the pent-up demand for trucks from recent years 
was already met in the reporting year, meaning that demand will return to normal in 2024."
"We anticipate that 
Türkiye will see a significant drop in demand."
"In South Africa, we expect demand to be on a level with the 
previous year."
The truck market in North America is divided into weight classes 1 to 8.
"We expect a noticeable 
decrease in new registrations in the segments relevant for Volkswagen – Class 6 to 8 (8.85 tonnes or heavier)."
"After a weak 2023 impacted by new emissions legislation, we estimate that demand in Brazil will pick up again 
and be noticeably higher than in the previous year."
"On average, we anticipate that the relevant truck markets will remain at a steady level for the years 2025 to 
2028."
"A noticeable year-on-year increase in demand is anticipated for 2024 in the bus markets relevant for the 
Volkswagen Group, whereby this will vary depending on the region."
"In the EU27+3 region, we expect demand on 
a level with the previous year."
"We forecast a significant increase in demand for school buses in the USA and 
Canada."
"For the bus market in Mexico, we anticipate a significant decline in volumes on account of the very strong 
trend in the reporting year."
New registrations in Brazil will probably be on a level with the prior-year figure.
"Overall, we expect demand for buses to be steady on average across the relevant markets for the period from 
2025 to 2028."
"TRENDS IN THE MARKETS FOR POWER ENGINEERING 
For 2024, we generally expect the market environment in the Power Engineering Business Area to remain chal-
lenging."
"The current geopolitical situation and the development of energy and commodity prices will continue to 
generate uncertainty in virtually all markets."
"The market volume in merchant shipping in 2024 is expected to remain at a stable level compared with the 
reporting year."
"Rising demand for new bulk carriers and tankers is anticipated, while demand for container ships 
and LNG tankers is expected to be at a lower level."
"The areas outside merchant shipping are likely to reach a 
higher level than in 2023."
"We expect to see an improvement in the cruise ship business due to the renewed rise 
in demand for travel activities."
The passenger ferry market is also expected to grow.
"We continue to anticipate a 
stable high level of demand for government vessels."
"In the offshore sector, further new order volumes for special 
applications are expected, such as for special offshore ships for wind turbines."
"Overall, we predict that the 
marine market will reach a similar level to that seen in the 2023 reporting year, with sustained competitive and 
price pressure."
"The general focus will continue to be on building new highly efficient ships that meet future 
emissions targets."
The market for power generation will remain in upheaval in 2024.
"Uncertainty in relation to sustainable and 
future-proof power generation will be prevalent, particularly in countries that have established clear climate-
neutrality targets."
"In these countries, the framework conditions required to expand the infrastructure for carbon-
neutral fuels are often not yet fully developed."
This remains a reason for cautious investment behavior.
"In the 
core business, we see a need for decentralized, hydrogen-ready power plants, primarily in Europe."
"Outside 
Europe, demand for ammonia-capable engines will increase."
"With an increasing proportion of renewable energy 
in the distribution networks, a further rise in demand for balancing facilities is expected around the world."
"These 
are used to meet power requirements if darkness and lack of wind mean that the share of renewables is not 
sufficient to ensure security of supply."
"A positive trend in demand for large electrolyzers as well as for power-to-
methane and power-to-methanol plants continues to be expected."
"We see a very dynamic global competitive 
environment in these areas with new providers and international partnerships."
"Alongside the risks posed by a 
continued lack of price stability in the markets and by bottlenecks in supply chains, we expect strong competi-
tion and price pressure – both in the core business and for power-to-X solutions."
"Report on Expected Developments  
 
217 
Group Management Report 
In turbomachinery, we expect sustained demand in 2024 for new applications relating to the energy transition 
and climate protection."
"Our traditional business will decline somewhat from a high level, primarily in oil and gas 
production."
"We nevertheless expect that the production plants will continue to be well utilized, assuming the 
level of competition seen to date is sustained."
"Both in the after-sales market for engines in the marine and power plant business and in the after-sales 
market for turbomachinery, we anticipate continued robust demand in 2024 albeit below the level of the 
reporting year, with the fraught geopolitical situation generating uncertainty."
"For the period 2025 to 2028, we expect to see growing demand in the power engineering markets."
"However, 
the extent and timing of this growth will vary in the individual business fields."
"It also remains to be seen how long 
the markets will be adversely affected by the major influential factors of global conflicts and energy sector 
trends."
"TRENDS IN THE MARKETS FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 
We assume that automotive financial services will prove highly important to global vehicle sales in 2024."
"The 
continuing shortages of intermediates and commodities may generate uncertainty, exacerbated by the conse-
quences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle East."
"Furthermore, the increased 
interest rates could put pressure on the demand for financial services."
"We expect demand to rise in emerging 
markets where market penetration has so far been low."
"Regions with established automotive financial services 
markets will probably see a continuation of the trend towards achieving mobility at the lowest possible total 
cost."
"The shift from financing to lease contracts that has begun in the European financial services business with 
individual customers will continue."
"Integrated end-to-end solutions, which include mobility-related service 
modules such as insurance and innovative packages of services, are likely to become increasingly important."
"Additionally, we expect that demand will increase for new forms of mobility, such as rental and car subscription 
services, and for integrated mobility services, for example parking, refueling and charging."
"We anticipate an 
increase in the importance of direct business between manufacturers and customers."
"The seamless integration 
of financial services into the online vehicle offering will become increasingly important in the promotion of this 
type of business."
We estimate that this trend will also persist in the years 2025 to 2028.
"In the mid-sized and heavy commercial vehicles category, we are seeing rising demand for financial services 
products in the emerging markets."
"In these countries in particular, financing solutions support vehicle sales and 
are thus an essential component of the sales process."
"In the developed markets, we expect to see increased 
demand for telematics services and services aimed at reducing total cost of ownership in 2024."
"This trend is also 
expected to persist in the period 2025 to 2028."

EXCHANGE RATE TRENDS 
In 2023, the euro appreciated slightly against the US dollar on an annual average."
"This followed a prior year in 
which the euro had been relatively weak due to the high uncertainty surrounding developments in the global 
economy."
The euro also appreciated slightly against sterling on an annual average basis.
"Changes in the euro 
against the currencies of the emerging markets were mixed."
"In particular, the Argentinian peso and Turkish lira 
lost value against the European single currency due to the persistent, extremely high rates of inflation."
"Against 
the Brazilian real, the euro’s value was virtually unchanged on an annual average."
"By contrast, the Mexican peso 
was on average significantly stronger against the European single currency than in the year 2022."
"The Chinese 
renminbi, the currencies of several emerging markets in Asia, and the South African rand depreciated against the 
euro year-on-year."
"For 2024, we expect the euro to appreciate slightly against the US dollar and to remain at a 
similar level against sterling as in the reporting year."
"We assume that the Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, 
Mexican peso, South African rand and Turkish lira will depreciate to varying degrees."
"Due to the difficult eco-
nomic situation in Argentina and the uncertainty following the presidential election, the Argentinian peso is 
expected to depreciate sharply."
"For 2025 to 2028, we expect that the euro will be stable against the key cur-
rencies, while the comparative weakness of the currencies in the aforementioned emerging markets will 
probably continue."
"However, there is still a general event risk, defined as the risk arising from unforeseeable 
market developments."
"INTEREST RATE TRENDS 
The turnaround in monetary policy, which began in many countries in 2022 due to the persistently high inflation 
rates – partly as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict – continued in the reporting year."
"Global interest rates 
rose further in fiscal year 2023."
"National central banks in nearly all of the major Western industrialized nations 
made corresponding adjustments to their key interest rates to further moderate the in some cases persistent and 
comparatively high rates of inflation."
Interest rates were also raised in many emerging markets.
"Whether there 
will be further changes in key interest rates in 2024 in the respective countries will depend firstly on the devel-
opment of inflation and secondly on the scale of a possible economic downturn."
"Overall, we expect a relatively 
slight increase in interest rates on average in 2024 compared to 2023."
"For the years 2025 to 2028, we estimate 
that interest rates will persist at a relatively high level."
"COMMODITY PRICE TRENDS 
Following a year of relatively high volatility and price increases for many raw and input materials in 2022 due to 
the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the commodity markets largely eased in fiscal year 2023."
"Overall, commodity prices 
were at a lower level compared with 2022."
"Compared with the previous year as a whole, the average prices for 
the commodities coking coal, cobalt, lithium, crude oil, nickel, aluminum and natural rubber fell significantly."
"The 
average decline in prices for the commodities copper and lead were less pronounced by comparison."
"Averaged 
over the year, the prices of the precious metals rhodium and palladium also recorded a significant decline, while 
the price of platinum remained stable compared with the prior year."
"For 2024, we expect prices for some com-
modities to continue to fall due to the technological transformation and as a result of surplus supplies."
"For the 
majority of commodities, however, we expect prices to rise given the anticipated recovery in the global economy."
We anticipate continued volatility in the commodity markets for the period from 2025 to 2028.

have significantly expanded our activities by launching the new Scout brand."
"Attention will also be directed 
towards a growing presence in the Chinese market, where we will also increase our local activities."
"Besides capex, investing activities will also cover additions to capitalized development costs."
"Like capex, 
they reflect, among other things, upfront expenditures in connection with updating and electrifying the model 
range as well as for digitalization and technologies of the future."
"Also included are the services of CARIAD, which 
is the company synergistically developing the software architecture of the future for Group brand vehicles."
"With the investments in our facilities and models, as well as in the development of electrified drives, plat-
forms and in digitalization, we are laying the foundation for profitable, sustainable growth at Volkswagen."
"These 
investments also include commitments arising from decisions taken in previous fiscal years."
"The Automotive 
investment ratio is expected to be between 13.5% and 14.5% in 2024."
"We aim to finance the investments in our Automotive Division from our own capital resources and expect 
cash flows from operating activities to exceed the Automotive Division’s investment requirements."
"We expect 
net cash flow for 2024 to be between €4.5 and €6.5 billion."
"This will include in particular investments for the 
future and cash outflows from mergers and acquisitions for the battery business field, which represent a vital 
pillar of the Volkswagen Group’s transformation."
"Net liquidity in the Automotive Division in 2024 is expected to 
be between €39 billion and €41 billion."
These plans are based on the Volkswagen Group’s current structures.
Our equity-accounted joint ventures in China are not included in the figures above.
"For 2024, these joint 
ventures plan to invest in e-mobility, further optimization of the model portfolio, the development of new mobility 
solutions and digitalization."
"Their capex will probably exceed the 2023 level and be financed from the com-
panies’ own funds."
"In the Financial Services Division, we are planning lower investment in 2024 than in the previous year."
"We 
expect the development of lease assets and of receivables from leasing, customer and dealer financing to lead to 
funds tied up in working capital, of which almost half will be financed from the gross cash flow."
"As is common in 
the sector, the remaining funding requirements will be met primarily through unsecured bonds on the money and 
capital markets, the issuing of asset-backed securities, customer deposits from the direct banking business, and 
through the use of international credit lines."
"SUMMARY OF EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS 
Our planning is based on the assumption that global economic output will grow overall in 2024 compared with 
2023, albeit at a slower pace."
"The persistently high inflation in major economic regions and the resulting restric-
tive monetary policy measures taken by central banks are expected to dampen consumer demand."
"We continue 
to believe that risks will arise from protectionist tendencies, turbulence in the financial markets and structural 
deficits in individual countries."
"In addition, continuing geopolitical tensions and conflicts are weighing on 
growth prospects; risks are associated in particular with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in 
the Middle East."
"We assume that both the advanced economies and the emerging markets will show positive 
momentum on average, but with below-average growth in gross domestic product (GDP)."
The trend in the automotive industry closely follows global economic developments.
"We assume that 
competition in the international automotive markets will intensify further."
"Crisis-related disruption to the global 
supply chain and the resulting impact on vehicle availability may weigh on the volume of new registrations."
Uncertainty may also arise from shortages of intermediates and commodities.
"These may be further exacerbated 
by the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle East and may, in 
particular, lead to rising prices for materials and a declining availability of energy."

"In the German passenger car market, we expect 
the volume of new registrations in 2024 to also be slightly up on the prior-year level."
"Sales of passenger cars in 
2024 are expected to significantly exceed the prior-year figures overall in markets in Central and Eastern 
Europe – subject to the further development of the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
"The volume of sales in the markets 
for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (up to 6.35 tonnes) in North America in 2024 is forecast to be 
slightly higher than the level seen the previous year."
"We also anticipate a slight increase in new registrations in 
the South American markets in 2024 compared with the previous year."
"Likewise, the passenger car markets in 
the Asia-Pacific region are expected to be slightly up on the prior-year level in 2024."
"Trends in the markets for light commercial vehicles in the individual regions will be mixed; on the whole, we 
expect the sales volume for 2024 to be slightly above the previous year’s figure."
"For 2024, we expect to see a noticeable downward trend in new registrations for mid-sized and heavy trucks 
with a gross weight of more than six tonnes compared with the previous year in the markets that are relevant for 
the Volkswagen Group, with variations from region to region."
"A noticeable year-on-year increase in demand is 
anticipated for 2024 in the bus markets relevant for the Volkswagen Group, whereby this will vary depending on 
the region."
We assume that automotive financial services will prove highly important to global vehicle sales in 2024.
"In a challenging market environment, we anticipate that deliveries to customers by the Volkswagen Group in 
2024 will increase by up to 3% compared to the previous year."
"Challenges will arise in particular from the economic situation, the increasing intensity of competition, vola-
tile commodity, energy and foreign exchange markets, and more stringent emissions-related requirements."
"We expect the sales revenue of the Volkswagen Group and the Passenger Cars Business Area to exceed the 
previous year’s figure by up to 5% in 2024."
"The operating return on sales for the Volkswagen Group and the Pas-
senger Cars Business Area is likely to be between 7.0% and 7.5%."
"For the Commercial Vehicles Business Area, we 
anticipate an operating return on sales of 8.5% to 9.5%, also amid a year-on-year increase of up to 5% in sales 
revenue."
"In the Power Engineering Business Area, we expect sales revenue to be up to 2% above the prior-year 
figure and operating profit to be in the low three-digit-million euro range."
"For the Financial Services Division, we 
forecast an increase of 3–7% in sales revenue compared with the prior year and an operating result in the range 
of €4.0 billion."
"In the Automotive Division, we are assuming an investment ratio of between 13.5% and 14.5% in 2024."
"We 
expect net cash flow in 2024 to be between €4.5 billion and €6.5 billion."
"This will include in particular invest-
ments for the future and cash outflows from mergers and acquisitions for the battery business field, which are a 
vital pillar of the Volkswagen Group’s transformation."
"Net liquidity in the Automotive Division in 2024 is expected 
to be between €39 billion and €41 billion."
"Our goal remains unchanged, namely, to continue with our robust 
financing and liquidity policy."
We then outline the main risks and opportunities arising in our business activities.
"OBJECTIVE OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM 
Only by promptly identifying, accurately assessing and effectively and efficiently managing the risks and oppor-
tunities arising from our business activities can we ensure the Volkswagen Group’s long-term success."
"The aim 
of the RMS and the ICS is to identify potential risks at an early stage so that suitable countermeasures can be 
taken to avert the threat of loss to the Company, and any risks that might jeopardize its continued existence can 
be ruled out."
"Assessing the likelihood of occurrence and extent of future events and developments is, by its nature, subject 
to uncertainty."
"We are therefore aware that even the best RMS cannot foresee all potential risks and even the 
best ICS can never completely prevent irregular acts."
"STRUCTURE OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM 
The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s RMS and ICS is based on the internationally recognized 
COSO framework for enterprise risk management (COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread-
way Commission)."
"The purpose of structuring the RMS/ICS in accordance with the COSO framework for enter-
prise risk management is so that potential risk areas are covered in full."
"Uniform Group principles are used as the 
basis for managing risks in a standardized manner."
Opportunities are not recorded in the RMS processes.
"Report on Risks and Opportunities 
(CONTAINS THE REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 289(4) OF THE HGB) 
Promptly identifying the risks and opportunities arising from our business activities and 
taking a forward-looking approach to managing them is crucial to our Company’s long-term 
success."
"A comprehensive risk management system and an internal control system help 
the Volkswagen Group deal with risks in a responsible manner."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities

Group Management Report 
THE VOLKSWAGEN THREE LINES MODEL 
 
Another key element of the RMS and ICS at Volkswagen is the Three Lines Model, which is required by, among 
other bodies, the European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA)."
"In line with this model, the 
Volkswagen Group’s RMS and ICS has three lines designed to protect the Company from significant risks 
occurring."
"The minimum requirements for the RMS and ICS, including the Three Lines Model, are set out in guidelines for 
the entire Group and are regularly reviewed and refined."
"In addition, regular training is offered on the RMS and 
ICS."
"A separate Group Board of Management Committee for Risk Management deals with the key aspects of the 
RMS and ICS every quarter."
"First line: Operational risk management and ICS 
The first line comprises the operational risk management and internal control systems at the individual Group 
companies and business units."
"The RMS and ICS are integral parts of the Volkswagen Group’s structure and 
workflows."
"Events that may give rise to risk are identified and assessed locally in the divisions and at the Group 
companies."
"Countermeasures are introduced, the remaining potential impact is assessed, and, if necessary, the 
information incorporated into the planning in a timely manner."
"Material risks are reported to the relevant com-
mittees on an ad hoc basis."
"The results of the operational risk management process are incorporated into plan-
ning and financial control on an ongoing basis."
"The targets agreed in the planning rounds are therefore con-
tinually reviewed in revolving planning updates."
"At the same time, the results of risk mitigation measures are 
promptly incorporated into the monthly forecasts regarding further business development."
"This means that the 
Board of Management also has access to an overall picture of the current risk situation via the documented 
reporting channels during the year."
"Supervisory Board/Board of Management
Management
Internal Audit
2nd line
Risk Management, 
Compliance, etc."
"The risks are identified 
and approved in a multiple-party verification process and then checked for plausibility by Group Risk Man-
agement."
"A score is calculated for each risk by multiplying the likelihood of occurrence (Prob) by the potential extent of 
the damage."
This enables comparison of the risks.
"The extent of the damage is calculated from the criteria of 
financial loss (Mat) and reputational damage (Rep) and the potential threat to adherence to external legal 
requirements (Req)."
A score between 0 and 10 is assigned to each of these criteria.
"The measures taken to 
manage and control risk are taken into account in the risk assessment (net perspective)."
"The score for a likelihood of occurrence of more than 50% in the analysis period is classified as high; for a 
medium classification, the likelihood of occurrence is at least 25%."
"For the criterion of financial loss, the score 
rises in line with the loss; the highest score of 10 is reached when the potential loss is upwards of €1 billion."
"The 
criterion of reputational damage can have characteristics ranging from local erosion of confidence and loss of trust 
at local level to loss of reputation at regional or international level."
"The potential threat to adherence to external 
legal requirements is classified based on the potential impact on the local company, the brand or the Group."
"In addition to strategic, operational and reporting risks, risks arising from potential compliance violations 
(compliance risks) and from sustainability issues (ESG) are also integrated into this process."
"Volkswagen Financial Services AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH have implemented their own RMS and ICS 
processes and regularly report to Group Risk Management."
"To review the Volkswagen Group’s risk-bearing capacity, Group Risk Management uses the risk reports for a 
regular comparison of the aggregated risk situation and risk-bearing capacity."
"A simulation is used to check 
whether individual risks might become a going-concern risk if they are aggregated."
"There were no indications of 
insufficient risk-bearing capacity at the Volkswagen Group in the 2023 fiscal year."
Risk reporting to the committees of Volkswagen AG depends on materiality thresholds.
"Risks with a risk score 
of 40 or more or potential financial loss of €1 billion or more are presented quarterly to the Board of Management 
and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG."
"In addition, the reporting includes all risks 
from the QRP with a risk score of 20."
"This is necessary if the risk may lead to 
potential financial loss of €1 billion or more and the likelihood of occurrence is estimated at greater than 50%."
"In recent years, a standardized ICS to better protect against process risks has also been developed and put in 
place in significant companies."
It continues to be introduced at further companies each year.
"The ICS thereby 
goes significantly beyond the requirements for the accounting-related ICS."
"In 25 catalogs of controls, the Group 
companies within its scope are presented with requirements in respect of the process risks and control objec-
tives to be covered in order to protect the value chain in a standardized manner."
"In addition to financial reporting issues, for example, they address process risks in development or produc-
tion, as well as in the areas of compliance and sustainability."
"The catalogs of controls are checked at regular 
intervals to verify that they are up to date and are regularly expanded."
"Key controls to cover process risks and control objectives are also tested for their effectiveness; any signifi-
cant weaknesses identified are reported to the responsible bodies at Volkswagen AG and resolved in the 
departments."
"Like the QRP, the standardized ICS is supported by the Risk Radar IT system."
We regularly optimize the RMS and ICS as part of our continuous monitoring and improvement processes.
"In 
the process, we give equal consideration to both internal and external requirements."
"As a component of the RMS, 
our Compliance Management System (CMS) is also subject to these control and adjustment mechanisms."
"Exter-
nal experts assist in the continuous enhancement of our RMS, CMS and ICS on a case-by-case basis."
"Third line: Review by Group Internal Audit 
Group Internal Audit helps the Board of Management to monitor the various divisions and corporate units within 
the Group."
"It regularly checks the risk early warning system and the structure and implementation of the RMS, 
ICS and compliance management system (CMS) as part of its independent audit procedures."
"The audit plan 
adopted by the Board of Management includes the first and second lines, i.e."
"the risk-mitigating functions in 
addition to the operational units."
"RISK EARLY WARNING SYSTEM 
The requirements for a risk early warning system are met by means of the RMS and ICS elements described 
above (first and second line)."
"The Company’s risk situation is ascertained, assessed and documented and 
therefore also complies with legal requirements."
"Independently of this, the external auditors check both the 
processes and procedures implemented in this respect and the adequacy of the documentation on an annual 
basis."
"The plausibility and adequacy of the risk reports are examined via spot checks in detailed interviews with 
the divisions and companies concerned."
"In addition, scheduled examinations as part of the audit of the annual financial statements are conducted at 
companies in the Financial Services Division."
"As part of the scheduled supervisory process and unscheduled audits, 
the competent supervisory authority assesses whether the requirements, strategies, processes and mechanisms 
ensure solid risk management and solid risk cover."
"Furthermore, the Prüfungsverband deutscher Banken 
(Auditing Association of German Banks) audits Volkswagen Bank GmbH from time to time."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities

Group Management Report 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG operates a risk early warning and management system."
"Its aim is to ensure 
that the locally applicable regulatory requirements are adhered to and at the same time to enable appropriate 
and effective risk management at Group level."
"Important components of it are regularly reviewed as part of the 
audit of the annual financial statements."
"On this basis, an overall conclusion is reached once a year on the adequacy and effectiveness of our RMS, 
CMS and ICS at a Volkswagen AG Board of Management meeting."
"The Board of Management has received no 
information to indicate that our RMS or ICS as a whole were inadequate or ineffective in fiscal year 2023."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limits to the effectiveness of any risk management, compliance management 
and control system."
"Even a system judged to be adequate and effective cannot, for example, ensure that all 
actually materializing risks will be identified in advance or that any process disruptions will be ruled out under all 
circumstances."
"These measures are designed to minimize the risk of material mis-
statement in the accounts and in external reporting."
"Main features of the Risk Management and integrated Internal Control System in the context of the  
financial reporting process 
The Volkswagen Group’s accounting is essentially organized along decentralized lines."
"For the most part, 
accounting duties are performed by the consolidated companies themselves or entrusted to the Group’s shared 
service centers."
"In principle, the financial statements of Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries prepared in accor-
dance with the IFRSs and the Volkswagen IFRS Accounting Manual are transmitted to the Group in encrypted 
form."
A standard market product is used for encryption.
"The aim of the Volkswagen IFRS Accounting Manual, which has been prepared taking into consideration 
external expert opinions, is to ensure the application and assessment of uniform accounting policies based on the 
requirements applicable to the parent."
"In particular, it includes more detailed guidance on the application of legal 
requirements and industry-specific issues."
"Components of the reporting packages that are required to be 
prepared by the Group companies are also set out in detail there, and requirements have been established for the 
presentation and settlement of intragroup transactions and the balance reconciliation process that is based on 
these."
"These 
discussions address both the plausibility of the single-entity financial statements and specific significant issues 
at the subsidiaries."
"Alongside plausibility checks, other control mechanisms applied during the preparation of 
the single-entity and consolidated financial statements of Volkswagen AG include the clear delineation of areas 
of responsibility and the application of the ""four eyes"" principle."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
227 
Group Management Report 
The effectiveness of the Internal Control System in the context of the accounting process is systematically 
assessed in significant companies as part of the standardized ICS."
"This begins with a risk analysis and definition 
of controls with the aim of identifying significant risks for the financial reporting process."
"Regular tests based on 
samples are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls."
"These form the basis for a self-evaluation of 
whether the controls are appropriately designed and effective."
"The combined management report of the Volkswagen Group and Volkswagen AG is prepared – in accordance 
with the applicable requirements and regulations – centrally but with the involvement of and in consultation 
with the Group units and companies."
"In addition, the accounting-related Internal Control System is independently reviewed by Group Internal Audit 
in Germany and abroad."
"Integrated consolidation and planning system 
The Volkswagen consolidation and corporate management system (VoKUs) enables the Volkswagen Group to 
consolidate and analyze both Financial Reporting’s backward-looking data and Controlling’s forward-looking 
data."
"VoKUs offers centralized master data management, uniform reporting, an authorization concept and the 
required flexibility with regard to changes to the legal environment, providing a technical platform that benefits 
Group Financial Reporting and Group Controlling in equal measure."
"To verify data consistency, VoKUs has a 
multi-level validation system that primarily checks content plausibility between the balance sheet, the income 
statement and the notes."

AVERAGE SCORES OF THE RISK CATEGORIES 
 
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
In this section, we outline the main risks and opportunities arising in our business activities."
"In order to provide a 
better overview, we have grouped the risks and opportunities into categories."
"At the beginning of each risk 
category, we state the most significant risks in order of their importance as identified using the risk score from 
the QRP."
We then describe the individual risks in no particular order.
"Unless explicitly mentioned, there were no 
material changes to the specific risks and opportunities compared with the previous year even though the 
weighting of individual risks has changed."
"The assessment of the Volkswagen Group’s risk categories and the reports to the Board of Management 
include amongst other items all risks reported to the Group Risk Management department with a risk score of 20 
or more for the units included from the QRP."
The risk categories are plotted based on the average scores.
"In the 
reporting year, no risks with such scores were reported for the “Risks from mergers & acquisitions and/or other 
strategic partnerships/investments” risk category."
"Where they can be assessed, 
risks and opportunities that we expect to occur are already reflected in our medium-term planning and our 
forecast."
"The following therefore reports on internal and external developments as risks and opportunities that, 
based on existing information, may result in a negative or positive deviation from our forecast or targets."
"The most significant risks from the QRP arise from a negative influence on markets and unit sales driven 
among other factors by restrictions on trade and increasingly protectionist tendencies."
"These risks also arise from increasingly protectionist tendencies and structural deficits 
which pose a threat to the performance of individual advanced economies and emerging markets."
"In addition, 
there are increasing environmental challenges that affect individual countries and regions to varying degrees."
"The worldwide transition from an expansionary to a more restrictive monetary policy together with persistently 
high inflation also presents risks for the macroeconomic environment."
"High private- and public-sector debt in 
many countries is clouding the outlook for growth and may likewise cause markets to respond negatively."
"Demo-
graphic change may also inhibit growth."
"A decline in growth in key countries and regions often has an immediate 
impact on the state of the global economy and therefore poses a central risk."
"The economic development of some emerging economies is being hampered primarily by dependence on 
energy and commodity prices and capital inflows, but also by socio-political tensions."
"Corruption, ineffective 
government structures and a lack of legal certainty can also pose risks."
"Geopolitical tensions and conflicts, along with signs of fragmentation in the global economy, are a further 
major risk factor to the performance of individual countries and regions."
"In light of the existing, strong global 
interdependence, local developments could also have adverse effects on the world economy."
"Any escalation of 
the conflicts in the Middle East or Africa, and particularly of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine since 
February 2022, for example, could cause upheaval on the global energy and other commodity markets and 
exacerbate migration trends."
"An aggravation of the situation in East Asia could also put a strain on the global 
economy."
"The same applies to violent conflicts, terrorist activities, cyberattacks and the spread of infectious 
diseases, which may suddenly result in unexpected market reactions."
"Overall, we expect the world economy to grow with a weaker momentum in 2024."
"However, due to the risk 
factors mentioned, as well as cyclical and structural aspects, a slump in global economic growth or a period of 
below-average growth rates is also possible."
"The macroeconomic environment may also give rise to opportunities for the Volkswagen Group if actual 
developments turn out to be more positive than expected."
"Sector-specific risks and market opportunities/potential 
Western Europe, especially Germany, and China are our main sales markets."
"A drop in demand in these regions 
due to the economic climate would have a particularly strong impact on the Company’s earnings including 
financial services."
"We counter this risk with a clear, customer-oriented, innovative and synergistic product and 
pricing policy."
"To diversify our main sales markets, we are pursuing a long-term growth strategy in the USA."
"Outside the current main sales markets, delivery volumes are spread widely across the key regions: Central 
and Eastern Europe, North America and South America."
"In addition, we either already have a strong presence in 
numerous existing and developing markets or are working systematically towards this goal."
"Particularly in  
 
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
230 
Group Management Report 
smaller markets with growth potential, we are increasing our presence with the help of strategic partnerships in 
order to cater to local requirements."
"The growth markets of Central and Eastern Europe, South America and Asia are particularly important to the 
Volkswagen Group."
"These markets harbor considerable potential; however, the underlying conditions in some 
countries in these regions make it difficult to increase unit sales figures there."
"Examples of these are customs 
regulations regarding the proportion of local production and minimum requirements (homologation, registra-
tions), as well as various trade barriers."
"At the same time, wherever the economic and regulatory situation 
permits, there are opportunities above and beyond current projections."
"These arise from faster growth in the 
emerging markets where vehicle densities are currently still low."
"Price pressure in established automotive markets for new and used vehicles as a result of high market satu-
ration is a further risk for the Volkswagen Group as a supplier of volume and premium models."
"Competitive 
pressures are also likely to remain high in the future."
"Individual manufacturers may respond by offering incen-
tives in order to meet their sales targets, putting the entire sector under additional pressure."
"There is a risk that excess capacity in global automotive production may lead to a rise in inventories and 
therefore an increase in tied-up capital."
"With a decline in demand for vehicles and genuine parts, automotive 
manufacturers may adjust their capacities or intensify measures to promote sales."
"This would lead to additional 
costs and greater price pressure."
"Supply chain disruption may give rise to the risk of underutilization of capacity in global automobile pro-
duction, meaning that existing demand can in some instances not be met and instead moves on."
"The demand that built up in individual established markets in times of crisis could result in a significant 
recovery if the economic environment eases more quickly than expected."
"In Europe, there is a risk that further municipalities and cities will impose a driving ban on vehicles with com-
bustion engines in order to comply with emission limits."
"China imposed a so-called “new energy vehicle quota” 
in 2019, which means that battery-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles will have to account 
for a certain proportion of a manufacturer’s new passenger car fleet."
"In the United States, California has for some 
years imposed a regulation followed by other US states that tightens the legal requirements on manufacturers 
each year for the sale of zero-emission vehicles."
"To ensure compliance with emissions standards, we contin-
uously tailor our range of vehicle models and engines to the conditions in the relevant markets."
"These require-
ments may lead to higher costs and consequently to price increases and declines in volumes."
Economic performance may vary from region to region.
"The resulting risks for our trading and sales com-
panies, such as in relation to efficient inventory management and a profitable dealer network, are substantial 
and are being responded to with appropriate measures on their part."
"However, financing business activities 
through bank loans remains difficult."
"Our financial services companies offer dealers financing on attractive 
terms with the aim of strengthening their business models and reducing operational risk."
"We have installed a 
comprehensive liquidity risk management system so that we can promptly counteract any liquidity bottlenecks 
at the dealership end that could hinder smooth business operations."
Volkswagen maintains a selective distribution system.
"Within the European Union, dealers and service part-
ners are selected – where permissible – using qualitative and quantitative-qualitative criteria in accordance with 
the provisions of EU Regulations 461/2010 and 720/2022."
"The previously relevant EU Regulation 330/2010 
was revised by the European Commission and replaced by the new, successor EU Regulation 720/2022, which 
  
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
231 
Group Management Report 
entered into force on June 1, 2022."
"As things stand at present, this revised EU regulation does not require any 
changes to be made to the current distribution system of Volkswagen AG."
"On April 17, 2023, the European Commission adopted Regulation (EU) 2023/822, which extends the block 
exemption for the vehicle sector technically expiring on May 31, 2023 (MVBER – Regulation (EU) 461/2010) by 
five years."
"In the updated guidelines, the European Commission no longer focuses solely on “technical infor-
mation”, but refers only in general terms to “input”, which in addition to technical information will in future 
include tools, training and vehicle-generated data."
"The guidelines also expressly clarify that if vehicle manu-
facturers unilaterally withhold a particular input, including vehicle-generated data, this may be considered abuse 
under Article 102 of the TFEU."
"It is not yet possible to predict whether and to what extent Volkswagen AG will be 
affected by these types of claims from independent operators and what economic impact these claims may 
have."
"Competition law requirements, including the Block Exemption Regulation 461/2010 and EU Regulations 
2018/858 and 2021/1244, aim to ensure and promote effective competition in the motor vehicle aftermarket."
"Volkswagen AG, too, is exposed to this competitive pressure and associated risks in respect of its servicing and 
maintenance offering."
"In Germany, legislation entered into force on December 2, 2020 to restrict or abolish design protection for 
repair parts through the introduction of a repair clause."
"In addition, the European Commission is evaluating the 
market with regard to existing design protection and has presented a draft to amend the directive on the legal 
protection of designs and models."
"A possible restriction or abolition of design protection for visible replacement 
parts, including at European level, could adversely affect the Volkswagen Group’s genuine parts business."
The automotive industry is facing a process of transformation with far-reaching changes.
"Electric drives, con-
nected vehicles and autonomous driving are associated with both opportunities and risks for our vehicle sales, 
our after-sales business and our dealerships."
"There is uncertainty 
regarding the widespread use of electric vehicles and the availability of the necessary charging infrastructure."
"There is also a risk of freight deliveries worldwide being shifted from trucks to other means of transport, and 
of demand for the Group’s commercial vehicles falling as a result."
"Below, we outline the regions and markets with the greatest growth potential for the Volkswagen Group."
"> China  
Demand for vehicles is expected to increase in the coming years due to the need for individual mobility."
"This 
also affects e-mobility, a market that is already dominated by high-volume domestic manufacturers, among 
others."
"It is also expected that demand will shift from the coastal metropolises to the country’s interior and 
that competitive pressure from local manufacturers will generally increase."
"We are increasingly forging partnerships and 
further expanding our production capacity in this growing market, for example with the new plants for electric 
vehicles in Anhui and Changchun."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
232 
Group Management Report 
> India  
The demand for new vehicles is likely to increase over the coming years in this important future market, partly 
due to demographic change."
"The Volkswagen Group has consolidated its activities in India and launched a 
model initiative with new models tailored to customers’ needs: the Taigun from the Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars brand and the Škoda Kushaq and Slavia."
"> USA  
In the saturated US market, the proportion of light trucks (particularly SUVs and pickups) is likely to further 
increase slightly in the coming years."
"In addition, the electrification of mobility is expected to accelerate due to 
support measures and legally prescribed fleet emission and fuel consumption targets."
"The latter factors still 
depend, however, on which administration is in office."
"In the USA, Volkswagen Group of America is steadfast in 
its pursuit to become a full-fledged volume supplier and expand its market share."
"The expansion of local pro-
duction capacity – including production for electric vehicles since 2022 – will allow the Group to better serve 
the market in the North America region."
"We are also working intensively on offering additional products 
specifically tailored to the US market."
"By developing and producing an all-electric pick-up and a robust SUV, 
the Volkswagen Group plans to tap into the electric vehicle market with the US brand icon Scout."
"> Brazil  
Due to the need for individual mobility, demand for vehicles in Brazil is expected to increase in the coming 
years, particularly in the low-price, small-vehicle segments."
"Given existing trade barriers, local production is an 
important factor in ensuring competitiveness."
"The growing number of automobile manufacturers with local 
production has resulted in a sharp increase in price pressure and competition."
"To strengthen our competitive 
position in Brazil, we offer vehicles tailored specially to this market that are locally produced, such as the 
Saveiro and the Nivus."
"> Middle East 
Political and economic uncertainty in the region are increasingly taking their toll on the passenger car markets."
"In spite of this volatility, the Middle East region offers short-term and long-term growth potential."
"We aim to 
leverage the potential for growth with a range of vehicles that has been specifically tailored to this market, 
without having our own production facilities there."
"Power Engineering 
Global economic trends such as digitalization and the increasing interest in emissions-reducing technologies 
associated with decarbonization will continue."
"Growing global energy needs call for innovation in the industry 
and a growing willingness on the part of governments to invest in line with the global climate policy."
"The development of the marine market continues to carry risk given the current uncertainty regarding future 
fuel and emissions regulations."
"The continuing uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic situation holds addi-
tional risks, but also offers opportunities, for example in the navy and offshore wind energy business."
"In turbomachinery, there is the risk that planned projects and orders will be scaled back or postponed due to 
negative developments in sales markets or individual applications."
"These risks are countered by constantly monitoring the markets, focusing on less strongly affected market 
segments, working closely with all business partners such as customers and licensees, and introducing new and 
improved technologies."
"Moreover, significant 
potential can be leveraged in the medium term by enhancing our after-sales business through the introduction of 
new digital products and the expansion of our service network."
"Digital service solutions, for instance for remote plant surveillance, offer further 
growth potential."
"As part of the capital goods industry, the Power Engineering business is affected by fluctuations in the 
investment climate."
"Even minor changes in growth rates or growth forecasts, resulting from geopolitical uncer-
tainties or volatile commodities and foreign exchange markets, for example, carry the risk of significant changes 
in demand or the cancellation of already existing orders."
"The measures we use to counter the substantial economic and extraordinary risks include flexible production 
concepts and cost flexibility by means of temporary external personnel, working time accounts and Kurzarbeit 
(short-time working), and the necessary structural adjustments."
"Sales risks  
There is a risk that the Volkswagen Group could experience decreases in demand, possibly exacerbated by media 
reports or insufficient communication."
"Other potential consequences include lower margins in the new and used 
car businesses and a temporary increase in funds tied up in working capital."
"The Volkswagen Group’s multibrand strategy may weaken individual Group brands if there are overlaps in 
customer segments or the product portfolio."
"This effect may be reinforced by the Volkswagen Group’s common-
parts strategy, as this strategy means that, in some cases, the differences in product substance between the 
brands are small."
"As a result, there could be a risk of internal cannibalization between the Group brands, higher 
marketing costs, or repositioning expenses."
"By sharpening the brand identities, we are working to minimize these 
risks."
"The fleet customer business continues to be characterized by increasing concentration and internationali-
zation, accompanied by the risk that the loss of individual fleet customers may result in relatively high volume 
losses."
"Viewed over an extended period, the fleet customer business is more stable than the business with retail 
customers."
"The Volkswagen Group is well positioned with its broad portfolio of products and drive systems, as 
well as its target-group-focused customer care, and counteracts a concentration of default risks at individual 
fleet customers or markets."
"The consistently high market share in Europe shows that fleet customers still have 
confidence in the Group."
"Consumer demand is shaped not only by real factors such as disposable income, but also by psychological 
factors that cannot be planned for."
"For example, households’ worries about the future economic situation may 
lead to unexpected buyer reluctance."
"This is particularly the case in saturated automotive markets such as 
Western Europe, where demand could drop as a result of owners holding on to their existing vehicles for longer."
"We are countering the risk of buyer reluctance with our attractive range of models and our strict policy of cus-
tomer orientation."
"A combination of buyer reluctance in some markets as a result of the crisis, and increases in some vehicle 
taxes based on CO2 emissions – which have already been observed in many European countries – may shift 
demand towards smaller segments and engines, for example."
"We counter the risk that such a shift will negatively 
impact the Volkswagen Group’s financial situation by constantly developing new, fuel-efficient vehicles and 
alternative drive technologies, based on our drivetrain, fuel and mobility strategies."
"Automotive markets around the world are exposed to risks from government intervention such as tax 
increases, which curb private consumption, and from restrictions on trade and protectionist tendencies such as 
tariffs and sanctions."
"Furthermore, there are future risks from the sale of electrified vehicles if the minimum 
requirements for local content under free trade agreements cannot be achieved."
"Sales incentives may lead to 
shifts in the timing of demand."
"Furthermore, government regulations aimed at protecting human rights are putting increased pressure on 
companies to create greater transparency in their international supply chains."
"While companies are implementing 
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
234 
Group Management Report 
extensive measures in this regard, there is still a risk that complete transparency cannot be achieved."
"This may 
even lead to restrictions on imports of products suspected of being linked to human rights violations – either the 
products themselves or constituent parts."
"Commercial vehicles are capital goods: even minor changes in growth rates or growth forecasts may sig-
nificantly affect transport requirements and thus demand."
"The resulting risk of production fluctuations calls for a 
high degree of flexibility from the manufacturers."
"Although production volumes are significantly lower, the com-
plexity of the trucks and buses range does in fact significantly exceed the already very high complexity of the 
passenger cars range."
"Key factors for commercial vehicle customers are total cost of ownership, vehicle reli-
ability and the service provided."
"Furthermore, customers are increasingly interested in additional services such 
as freight optimization and fleet utilization, which we offer in the commercial vehicle segment through the digital 
brand RIO, for example."
"Power Engineering’s two-stroke engines are produced exclusively by licensees, particularly in South Korea, 
China and Japan."
"There is a slight uptrend in global demand for merchant ships; however, the volatility in new 
shipbuilding orders poses the risk of declining license revenues."
"Due to changes in the competitive environment, 
especially in China, there is also the risk of losing market share."
The Volkswagen Group does not have any material subsidiaries or equity investments in these regions.
"In relation to the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the Volkswagen Group, the busi-
ness activities of the Volkswagen Group in these regions are insignificant."
"Other factors 
In addition to the risks outlined in the individual risk categories, there are other factors that cannot be predicted 
and whose repercussions are therefore difficult to control."
"Should these transpire, they could have an adverse 
effect on the further development of the Volkswagen Group."
"Research and development risks 
For this risk category, the likelihood of occurrence is classified as high (previous year: high) and the potential 
extent of damage is classified as medium (previous year: medium)."
"The most significant risks from the QRP result from the inability to develop products in line with demand and 
requirements, especially with regard to e-mobility and digitalization."
"Risks arising from research and development 
The automotive industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation process."
"For multinational corporations 
like Volkswagen, this means risks in the areas of customer/market, technological advancements and legislation."
"One risk posed is the implementation of ever more stringent emission and fuel consumption regulations, such as 
C6 in China or Euro-7 in Europe from 2025."
New test procedures and test cycles (e.g.
"the Worldwide Harmonized 
Light Vehicles Test Procedure, WLTP), and their progressive tightening, as well as compliance with approval 
processes (homologation) are becoming increasingly complex and time-consuming."
"The test specifications and 
homologation procedures also vary greatly from country to country."
"There is therefore a risk of non-conformity in the 
manufacture, procurement and introduction of products such as automobiles or replacement parts."
"The economic success and competitiveness of the Volkswagen Group depend on how swiftly we are able to 
tailor our portfolio of products and services to changing conditions."
"Given the intensity of competition and speed 
of technological development, for example in the fields of digitalization and automated driving, there is a risk of 
failing to identify relevant trends early enough to respond accordingly."
We use the latest findings from the world of physics and other areas of science to plot our course.
"In addition, 
we conduct research such as trend analyses and customer surveys and examine the relevance of the results for 
our customers."
"To reduce the risk of patent infringements, we conduct thorough analyses of third-party industrial property 
rights; increasingly also in relation to communication technologies."
"We regularly compare the results of all these analyses with the respective project targets; in the event of any 
discrepancies, we introduce appropriate countermeasures."
"Our end-to-end project organization fosters cooper-
ation across all of the departments involved in the process, ensuring that specific requirements are incorporated 
into the development process as early as possible and that their implementation is planned in good time."
"Risks and opportunities from the modular toolkit strategy 
We are continuously expanding our modular toolkits, focusing on future customer requirements, legal require-
ments and infrastructural requirements."
"However, with higher volumes there is a higher risk that supply chain disruption – for example due to parts 
supply shortages – or quality problems may affect an increasing number of vehicles."
"The Modular Transverse Toolkit (MQB) is an extremely flexible vehicle architecture that was created to allow 
conceptual dimensions – such as the wheelbase, track width, wheel size and seat position – to be harmonized 
throughout the Group and utilized flexibly."
"Other dimensions, for example the distance from the pedals to the 
middle of the front wheels, are always the same, ensuring a uniform system in the front end of the car."
"Thanks to 
the resulting synergies, we are able to reduce both development costs and the necessary one-time expenses, as 
well as manufacturing times."
"The toolkits also allow us to produce different models from different brands in 
varying quantities, using the same equipment in a single plant."
"This means that our capacities can be used with 
greater flexibility throughout the entire Group, enabling us to achieve efficiency gains."
"We have also transferred this principle of standardization with maximum flexibility to the Modular Electric 
Drive Toolkit (MEB) and Premium Platform Electric (PPE) concepts developed for all-electric drives."
"The syner-
gies and efficiency gains offered by the modular toolkit strategy are enabling us to bring e-mobility into mass 
production worldwide with the MEB- and PPE-based vehicles."
"In future, we aim to reinforce these synergistic 
effects by combining the MEB and PPE in the Scalable Systems Platform (SSP)."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
236 
Group Management Report 
Operational risks and opportunities  
For this risk category, the likelihood of occurrence is classified as medium (previous year: high) and the potential 
extent of damage is classified as medium (previous year: medium)."
"The most significant risks from the QRP lie particularly in cybersecurity and new regulatory requirements 
regarding IT, as well as in volatile procurement markets, here primarily in relation to the supply of parts, and in 
quality problems."
"As a consequence, bottlenecks or 
even outages in production may occur, thus preventing the planned production volumes from being achieved."
Early warning systems help to identify supply risks and prevent assembly line stoppages.
"We keep global and 
local risks under constant observation so as to be able to respond quickly to effects throughout the entire supply 
chain."
"In addition, measures to counteract further risks include comprehensive safety and emergency response 
concepts such as fire prevention, property protection, hazardous goods management and task forces, and we 
take out corresponding insurance coverage where this makes economic sense."
"Countermeasures may include finding alternatives where suppliers are unavailable and organizing special 
processes."
"Procurement, in collaboration with all Group departments and the supplier network, was able to put 
these measures to the test in 2023, particularly in securing purchased parts from flooded areas of Slovakia."
"Risks and opportunities from Procurement and Technology  
Current trends in the automotive industry such as e-mobility and automated driving are resulting in an increased 
need for financing among suppliers, presenting them with considerable challenges."
"These are being exacerbated 
by the current commodity price situation and the limited availability of semiconductors."
"The supplier risk 
management department in Procurement at the Volkswagen Group evaluates in particular the financial situation 
of suppliers, before they are entrusted with the implementation of projects."
"Procurement takes into account the 
recommendations of the supplier risk management department."
"The risk of supply shortages and disruption to supply continues to exist, particularly given the current global 
geopolitical and macroeconomic situation."
"Examples include the continuing constraints in the supply of 
semiconductor components and the direct and indirect effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including potential 
temporary interruptions to the energy supply."
"Supply risks are identified in Procurement by means of early warning systems and task force and mitigation 
structures have been created to reduce these risks."
"In addition, strategic measures are to be taken to avoid future 
impacts in the long term."
"The sharp increase in commodity and energy prices resulting from the global economic trends and crises of 
recent years plus the significant rise in personnel costs is impacting the financial situation of many suppliers."
"Furthermore, the rapid rise in financing costs combined with more restrictive lending is placing additional 
burdens on suppliers and limiting their ability to finance new projects and capacity adjustments."
"This, too, is 
giving rise to the risk of bottlenecks and disruptions in supplies."
"Demand for resources, possible speculations on the market and current trends in the automotive industry, 
such as the growing share of electrified vehicles, may affect the availability and prices of certain raw materials."
"Trends in raw materials and demand are continuously analyzed and assessed on an interdisciplinary basis to 
enable steps to be taken at an early stage in the event of potential bottlenecks."
"The risks in battery cell production relate particularly to the rising demand for battery cells and the resulting 
reliance on suppliers, from technological change and from the service life of battery cells."
"Additional risks may 
arise from long-term ties to cell manufacturers and the direct responsibility of Volkswagen in the supply chain."
"To counter these risks, the Volkswagen Group maintains multiple strategic supplier relationships while extending 
the scope of its own activities along the value chain (raw material extraction, cell production) at the same time."
Commodity risks can be partially mitigated through backward integration of the value chain.
"For example, 
partnerships and long-term supply agreements with commodity suppliers can be used to ensure the supply of 
the relevant material while also achieving competitive prices."
"Quality problems may necessitate technical intervention involving a substantial financial outlay if the cost 
cannot be passed on to the supplier or can only be passed on to a limited extent."
"We constantly analyze the conditions 
specific to each market and adapt our quality requirements to their individual needs."
"We counter the local risks 
we identify by continuously developing measures and implementing them locally, thereby preventing quality 
defects in the supply chain from arising."
"It is not possible at present to rule out the possibility of a further increase in recalls of various models pro-
duced by a variety of manufacturers in which certain airbags manufactured by Takata were installed."
"This could 
also affect Volkswagen Group models."
"Specialists in Procurement systematically investigate risks resulting from antitrust violations by suppliers and 
file claims for any losses that may arise."
"Risks in the supply chain may also arise from the non-fulfillment of statutory duty of care in respect of human 
rights and the environment, which might lead, for example, to supply shortages in production or to sanctions in 
sales."
"The requirements are compared with existing processes with the help of gap analyses, and processes are 
developed and implemented to fill in any gaps."
"In order to meet our duty of care in respect of human rights, and 
to identify, counteract and prevent the associated risks in the value chain, we developed and implemented a 
responsible supply chain system in 2022."
"Production risks 
Production risks for the Volkswagen Group arise in particular from the overarching framework, from supply risks, 
from internal, strategic and operational challenges and from sales risks."
"Countermeasures and precautions are 
taken in accordance with the principles of risk management so as to mitigate each of the risks identified."
"Risks arising from the overarching framework include in particular potential disruption to our own operating 
ability or to the supply of inputs crucial for operation that is caused by extreme weather events in the form of 
flooding and drought, severe storms or similar."
"These may lead to production stoppages with financial ramifi-
cations for the Group."
"The Group manages these risks by systematically analyzing the impacts of climate change 
 
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
238 
Group Management Report 
on its production sites and using the findings to develop specific countermeasures for the individual locations 
and risk type."
"Other overarching risks may arise as a result of social and political changes as well as from other failure of 
critical infrastructure – for example in the form of supply risks."
"Here the Volkswagen Group reduces its risk by 
taking measures to lower consumption and by making its use of raw materials more flexible, provided this is 
economically viable."
"In addition, we prepare compensatory measures between locations that reduce the 
economic effects of risks for the Group as a whole."
"Internally, the trend away from conventional vehicles with 
combustion engines and towards a higher share of electric vehicles is giving rise to production risks."
"In individual 
cases, an uneven transition to e-mobility may lead to temporary gaps in capacity utilization."
"In principle, the 
international production network enables us to respond flexibly at the sites and adjust capacity utilization 
between production facilities by means of “turntable concepts”."
"The diversity of our models, the reduced product 
life cycles and the use of complex processes and technical systems have increased the risk of a delay to the start 
of production of a vehicle in recent years."
"We address this risk by drawing on the experience of past production 
starts and identifying weaknesses at an early stage so as to ensure – to the highest degree possible – that 
production volumes and quality standards are met during the start of production of our vehicles throughout the 
Group."
"At an operational level, machine and system failures pose a risk in production."
"Our comprehensive pre-
ventive maintenance concepts and emergency response concepts can prevent these failures or mitigate their 
impact."
"In unit sales, risks arise from fluctuations in demand as regards volumes and vehicle characteristics."
"Pro-
duction risks arising from fluctuations in production volumes affecting vehicle models concern in particular 
utilization of production capacity."
"This is planned several years in advance based on long-term sales planning for 
all vehicle projects."
The risk is that market momentum and changes in demand will not be forecast correctly.
"If 
forecasts are too optimistic, there is a risk that capacity will not be fully utilized."
"However, forecasts that are too 
pessimistic pose a risk of undercapacity, as a result of which it may not be possible to meet customer demand."
"As a countermeasure, the initial investment can be focused on a certain minimum number of units so that the full 
planned number of units or a higher number of units can be covered with flexible additional investments."
"In 
addition, turntable concepts help us to adjust capacity utilization between production facilities."
"Flexible working 
time models allow us to stabilize employee productivity when the number of production units fluctuates."
"The 
availability of buildable orders for production poses another risk to unit sales."
"Legal changes, for instance in the 
context of the changeover to the WLTP test procedure or new cybersecurity requirements in accordance with the 
UNECE regulation, may impact production."
"For one thing, a temporary reduction in the range causes demand to 
focus on the available variants."
"For another, gaps in production can occur if model variants have not been 
approved."
"In such cases, until official approval is granted, production can be stabilized by producing and 
temporarily storing vehicles, including customer-specific vehicles."
"The resulting tied-up capital and the avail-
ability of storage areas are limiting factors, however."
"There is a risk that a backlog will be created due to the slow 
outflow of built vehicles, which will also limit the number of production units."
"We counteract this risk by taking 
specific measures to speed up the process up to the end customer and through early contractual commitment of 
transport capacity."
"Risks arising from long-term production 
In the case of large projects within the Power Engineering Business Area, risks may arise that are often only 
identified over the course of the project."
"The current disproportionate increases in commodity prices, energy 
prices and freight rates, and the limited availability of semiconductor products, may have a detrimental impact 
on production costs and revenue recognition."
"The aim is to identify these risks at an early stage and to take appropriate measures to eliminate or minimize 
them in advance, particularly during the bidding and planning phase of large upcoming projects."
"This is done by 
constantly optimizing the project control process across all project phases and by using a lessons-learned 
process and regular project reviews."
"Quality risks 
We strive to identify and rectify quality problems at an early stage during the development of our products to 
avoid, among other things, delays to the start of production."
"As we are using an increasing number of modular 
components as part of our platform strategy, it is particularly important when malfunctions do occur to identify 
the cause quickly and eliminate the faults."
"Nonconformity of internally or externally sourced parts, components 
or functions may necessitate time-consuming and cost-intensive measures, leading to recalls and therefore 
damage to the Volkswagen Group’s image."
"In addition, the resulting financial impact may exceed provisions."
"To 
meet our customers’ expectations and minimize warranty and ex gratia repair costs, we are continuously opti-
mizing the processes at our brands with which we can prevent these faults."
"If quality management is ineffective, there is a risk of losing ISO 9001 and KBA certification."
"This would lead 
directly to a loss of type approval from one or more authorities."
"We counter this risk by continuously training the 
Group’s system auditors, while our quality management system and process quality undergo internal audits."
"We also check the conformity of series products (CoP – conformity of production) in vehicle production plants 
as part of system audits with a CoP component."
"Further risks are associated with discrepancies identified in con-
formity of production measurements and in-service-conformity (ISC) measurements."
"We have established an 
effective system for monitoring the conformity of CoP and ISC measurements for manufactured vehicles."
"To 
ensure that the results of the emissions CoP and ISC measurements are analyzed systematically, we have imple-
mented an IT system throughout the Group."
"This is used for status reporting and documenting the results of the 
series of measurements."
"Vehicle registration and operation criteria are defined and monitored by national and, in some cases, inter-
national authorities."
"Furthermore, several countries have special – and in some cases new – rules aimed at 
protecting customers in their dealings with vehicle manufacturers."
"We have established quality processes so 
that the Volkswagen Group brands and their products fulfill all respective applicable requirements and local 
authorities receive timely notification of all issues requiring reporting."
"By doing so, we reduce the risk of 
customer complaints or other negative consequences."
"With the increasing technical complexity of vehicles due to their internal and external connectivity, and the 
platforms and toolkit systems in use across brands, the quality of the parts and software components supplied 
must be assured."
This is lending ever greater importance to cybersecurity.
"To better monitor and manage the risk 
of cyberattacks on our vehicles in the future, we continuously optimize the Automotive Cyber Security Man-
agement Systems in all Group brands and exchange information about processes and products across the 
brands."
"In addition to mastering the complexity resulting from ever-increasing cybersecurity requirements, the 
focus here is primarily on protecting customers and our products."
"Harmonized processes across the Group, such 
as the car security incident process, enable a fast reaction speed across the brands in the event of an attack so 
that any weaknesses in our products can be promptly eliminated."
"The Automotive Cyber Security Management 
System is an integral part of our quality management system, which helps us leverage synergies with already 
existing structures."
"This approach serves to fulfil the legal requirements of the UNECE regulation on cyber-
security."
"The Group brands and companies implement these policies in 
the form of in-house regulations."
"In the event of safety defects, doubts about compliance with legal require-
ments, or quality issues relating to the brand image, the APS examines the matter concerned and decides on an 
appropriate response."
"In this context, the APS is also responsible for managing related inquiries from authorities."
The cross-divisional Car Security Board (CSB) provides support with regard to cybersecurity issues.
"We have also created and established central units within the organization, which are responsible for man-
aging incoming information on APS- and CSB-related topics."
"We have established a universal, transparent man-
agement and tracking system to follow up on all such information across the Group without employee involve-
ment, right through to the APS decision."
"In addition, numerous events and training courses are held to improve 
awareness of safety risks and products’ legal conformity among all employees."
"These activities aim to avoid risks 
from delayed, lacking, or incomplete reporting and preliminary analyses."
"The entire APS process is, moreover, 
subject to regular review in the form of internal and external audits aimed at ensuring compliance with the require-
ments and thus also minimizing risks arising from the decision-making process on the part of the APS or CSB."
"IT risks 
At Volkswagen, a global provider of sustainable mobility, the information technology (IT) used in all business 
units Group-wide is assuming an ever more important role."
"Proper handling of data is a key factor for 
data integrity, and for the functionality of error-free systems."
"The high standards we set for the quality of our products also apply to the way in which we handle our cus-
tomers’ and employees’ data."
"There is a risk of cyberattacks, particularly on our digital offerings."
"Legal regu-
lations including the UNECE cybersecurity regulation (R155) define the requirements for our vehicle and soft-
ware development."
These also have a large impact on our IT systems.
"We therefore work on an interdisciplinary 
basis to protect our connected vehicles and mobility services."
"Our guiding principles are data security, trans-
parency, informational self-determination and the safety and security of the customer when using our services."
"We counter the risk of unauthorized access to, modification or extraction of corporate and customer data 
through risk-based use of IT security technologies such as modern security systems for detecting malware and 
malicious behavior."
"We achieve additional protection by restricting the allocation of access rights to systems and central adminis-
tration, including periodic identity checks."
"Based on business impact analyses, we counter data destruction or 
disruption to operation by designing systems with redundancy and implementing backup strategies."
"Identified IT-related risks are regularly assessed using the methodology specified by the Group and reported 
to the Board of Management."
Risk mitigation is followed up at top management level.
"This includes, for example, 
business-critical IT systems used across the Group or sensitive data such as vehicle or customer data."
"An overarching committee with members from Information Security, Data Protection, Group Security, Legal 
Affairs and other parties involved handles interdisciplinary information security and reports directly to the Group 
Board of Management."
This enables a rapid response and the efficient coordination of measures.
"This tactical 
set-up has proven valuable in practice, as demonstrated, among other things, by the rapid management of a 
major incident that occurred in September 2023."
"We use market-leading technologies that are customary on the market and state of the art to protect our IT 
landscape, adhering to standards applicable throughout the Company."
"We future-proof our IT through continual 
standardization and updates."
"Continuously increasing automation enhances process reliability and the quality of 
processing."
"The further development and Group-wide use of IT governance processes, particularly the further standardi-
zation of the risk management process for IT and information security, also help to identify weaknesses at an 
early stage and to reduce or avoid risks effectively."
"Another focus is the continuous advancement of Group-wide security measures to detect, avert and deal with 
cyberthreats."
Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in this context.
"Risks from media impact 
The image of the Volkswagen Group and its brands is one of the most important assets and forms the basis for 
long-term business success."
"Our policy and strategic orientation on issues such as integrity, ethics, sustain-
ability and climate protection are in the public focus."
"One of the basic principles of running our business is 
therefore to continuously check and pay particular attention to compliance with legal requirements and ethical 
principles."
"However, we are aware that misconduct or criminal acts by individuals and the resulting reputational 
damage can never be fully prevented."
"In addition, media reactions can have a negative effect on the image of the 
Volkswagen Group and its brands."
"This impact also depends significantly on the effectiveness of our communi-
cation during times of crisis."
"Environmental and social risks 
For this risk category, the likelihood of occurrence is classified as high (previous year: medium) and the potential 
extent of damage is classified as medium (previous year: high)."
The most significant risks from the QRP arise from non-fulfillment of CO2-related requirements.
"Personnel risks 
We use a range of instruments to counter economic risks as well as changes in the market and the competitive 
situation and shortages of supplier components."
"These help the Volkswagen Group to remain flexible in terms of 
staff deployment when faced with a fluctuating order situation – whether orders are in decline, or there is an 
increase in demand for our products."
"The use of temporary workers also allows us to 
be more flexible in our planning."
"All of these measures help the Volkswagen Group to generally maintain a stable 
permanent workforce, even when orders fluctuate."
"The technical expertise and individual commitment of employees are indispensable prerequisites for the 
success of the Volkswagen Group."
"We counter the risk of not being able to develop sufficient expertise in the 
Company’s different vocational groups with our strategically oriented and holistic human resource development, 
which gives all employees attractive training and development opportunities."
"By boosting our training programs, 
particularly at our international locations, we are able to adequately address the challenges of technological 
change and the structural transformation of the automotive industry."
"To counter the potential risk of a shortage of skilled specialists – especially in the areas of digitalization and 
IT – we continuously expand our recruitment tools."
"Our systematic talent relationship management, for example, 
enables us to make contact with talented candidates from strategically relevant target groups at an early stage 
and to build a long-term relationship between them and the Group."
"By systematically increasing our attractiveness as an employer, we are able 
to gain talented people in areas that are crucial for the future, such as electrical engineering, chemistry or infor-
mation technology."
"With tools such as these, we want to ensure that our demand for qualified new staff is 
covered, even amid a shortage of skilled labor."
"We counter the risks associated with employee fluctuation and loss of knowledge as a result of retirement 
with intensive, department-specific succession planning and training."
"The advancing digitalization of our human resources processes entails risks arising from the processing of 
personal data, but also system-based improvements so that Volkswagen can ensure compliance with data pro-
tection laws when processing personal data."
"Volkswagen is aware of its responsibility in the processing of this 
data."
"To make processing compliant with data protection requirements, we address risks as part of our data pro-
tection management system by implementing a wide range of measures."
"The basis of successful occupational health and safety is complying with legal requirements, identifying and 
assessing work-related risks, determining appropriate measures and monitoring their effectiveness."
"This makes 
a positive contribution to maintaining the health of our employees as part of society."
"Ensuring a safe and healthy 
working environment is an important element of corporate sustainability, particularly during our transformation."
"It is also a major component of employer attractiveness, as it helps to effectively reduce the associated risks and 
minimize process disruptions and production stoppages."
"Environmental protection regulations 
The specific emission targets for all new passenger car and light commercial vehicle fleets for brands and 
groups in the EU for 2020 and subsequent years are set out in Regulation (EU) No 2019/631."
"This regulation is a 
material component of the European climate protection policy and therefore forms the key regulatory framework 
for product design and marketing by all vehicle manufacturers selling in the European market."
"Adopted and published by the EU in 2019, the regulation states that, from 2021 onward, the average 
emissions of European passenger car fleets must be no higher than 95 g CO2/km."
"Up to and including 2020, 
European fleet legislation was complied with on the basis of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC)."
"From 
2021 onward, the NEDC target value was replaced by a WLTP target value through a process defined by law-
makers; this change has not led to additional tightening of the target value."
"A similar approach applies to light 
commercial vehicles, where a target of 147 g CO2/km has applied to the entire fleet since 2021."
"The targets will be tightened as from 2025: for new European passenger car fleets, a reduction of 15% in CO2 
emissions will therefore be required from 2025 and a reduction of 55% from 2030."
"For new light commercial 
vehicle fleets, the required reductions will be 15% from 2025 and 50% from 2030."
"For 2035, a CO2 reduction 
target of 100% will then apply to new passenger car and light commercial vehicle fleets."
"In each case, the 
starting point is the WLTP fleet value in 2021."
"These targets can only be achieved through a growing proportion 
of electric vehicles within the fleet."
"If the respective fleet-wide target is not fulfilled, the Commission may impose an excess emissions premium, 
amounting to €95 per excess gram of CO2 per newly registered vehicle."
"Fuel consumption 
regulations in China are being gradually tightened with a fleet average target of 4.6 l/100 km for 2025."
"More 
stringent rules are expected for the period after 2025."
"In addition to this legislation on fleet consumption, a new 
energy vehicle quota applies in China."
"This requires every manufacturer to increase the share of electric vehicles  
 
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
243 
Group Management Report 
in its total production or import volumes."
"For 2023, this quota was 18% and had to be fulfilled through battery-
electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, or fuel cell vehicles."
The quota will be increased further for 2024 and 2025.
There is no indication as to possible targets after 2025.
"In the USA, the annual CO2 and efficiency targets to be fulfilled by the fleet for new passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles are defined by the Greenhouse Gas legislation (GHG) and Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
legislation (CAFE)."
"In December 2021, the current administration published new CO2 fleet targets for the period 
from 2022 to 2026."
"The industry-wide fleet average for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles is to 
reduce from 137 g CO2/km in 2022 to 106 g CO2/km in 2026, reversing the relaxation of the targets by the pre-
vious government."
"The same applies to the CAFE efficiency targets for 2024 to 2026, which were announced in 
spring 2022."
"The fleet targets to be achieved will therefore become more stringent each year in the period up to 
2026."
The current government has set a goal for 50% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030.
"This is expected 
to be reflected in ambitious targets in future GHG and CAFE regulations."
"In addition to this, in California and the 
other user states in the US, the regulations of the Californian zero-emission vehicle mandate must be adhered to, 
which prescribes annually increasing electrification rates for the new vehicle fleet."
"The aim is to fully electrify 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 2035."
"The tightening of fleet-based CO2 emissions and fuel consumption regulations makes it necessary to use the 
latest mobility technologies in all affected markets."
"Above all, electrified and also purely electric drivetrains are 
becoming increasingly common."
"The Volkswagen Group closely coordinates technology and product planning 
with its brands so as to avoid breaches of fleet values, for example, which would entail severe payment obliga-
tions."
"Whether the Group meets its fleet targets depends crucially on its technological and financial capabilities, 
which are reflected in, for example, our drivetrain and fuel strategy."
"Alongside technical and portfolio electrification measures, it is also possible to use local statutory mecha-
nisms such as the creation of emission pools in Europe, for example, or the trading of emission credits in the 
United States and China."
Legislation provides further region-specific flexibility to aid target achievement.
"New, uniform limits for nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions in real road traffic 
have applied to new vehicle types across the EU since September 2017."
"This makes the RDE test procedure 
fundamentally different from the Euro-6 standard still in force, which stipulates that the limits on the chassis 
dynamometer are authoritative."
"The RDE regulation is intended primarily to improve air quality in urban areas 
and areas close to traffic, leading to stricter requirements for exhaust gas aftertreatment in passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles."
"Stricter RDE processes and requirements have resulted in certain challenges, for 
example relating to test criteria and homologation."
"The debate on successor emissions legislation (Euro-7) 
began at European level in late 2022 and ended in late 2023 with a compromise reached during the trilogue 
negotiations."
"The final regulation is not expected to be published in the Official Journal until the second quarter 
of 2024."
It is anticipated that this successor regulation will enter into force in the second half of the decade.
"Commercial vehicles are increasingly subject to ever stricter environmental regulations all around the world, 
particularly to regulations relating to climate change and vehicle emissions."
"With the revised Regulation (EU) 
2019/1242, the European Union set manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles with a permitted gross weight of over 
16 tonnes very ambitious targets for reducing CO2 emissions in Europe within the next decade."
"The target set for 
2025 of reducing CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles by 15% has been reaffirmed."
"The new CO2 emissions 
targets proposed for the same vehicle category nevertheless aim for a 45% reduction by 2030 (previously 30%) 
and a 65% reduction by 2035 based on a reference figure from the period July 2019 to June 2020."
"Furthermore, 
the European Commission intends to extend the targets to additional vehicle groups (all medium- and heavy-
duty vehicles over 5 tonnes, including buses; work vehicles and special-purpose vehicles have yet to be 
excluded)."
"The Commission has also proposed that all new city buses in Europe should be emission-free by 
2030."
"If emissions exceed these targets, fines amounting to €4,250 per excess gram of CO2/tonne-kilometer 
(tkm) per vehicle could be imposed from 2025 onwards."
"The European Council and the Parliament have finalized 
their positions on the Commission’s proposal to revise the Regulation setting CO2 emission performance stan-
dards for heavy-duty vehicles."
"The EU institutions hope to reach a compromise in the upcoming trilogue 
negotiations."
"In the European Green Deal, the Commission defined the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050."
"Targeting an ambitious reduction in EU CO2 emissions of at least 55% (previously 40%) compared to 1990 levels 
by 2030, this represents a big challenge for the entire transport sector."
"The revision of CO2 emission require-
ments for heavy-duty vehicles in 2023 and the compromise negotiated at the end of 2023 between repre-
sentatives of the European Parliament and the EU member states for a new Euro-7 standard on the usual air 
pollutants could further exacerbate these challenges."
"New regulations to reduce air pollutant emissions were introduced for commercial vehicle manufacturers in 
Brazil at the beginning of 2023."
"In the United States, emission regulations for CO2 and nitrogen oxide (NOx) are 
also likely to be tightened further for heavy-duty vehicles."
"CO2 reductions based on 2016 emission levels have 
already been defined for 2024 and 2027."
"The United States has also adopted a new NOx regulation that is due to 
enter into force in 2024 and 2027, respectively."
"In mid-2023, China set new targets for reducing CO2 emissions 
for all heavy-duty vehicles."
"Adapting commercial vehicles to new emission standards is complex and expensive, especially given the 
often contradictory regulations applicable to CO2 and other pollutant emissions from internal combustion engines."
"To meet the targets for the different markets, it is imperative to reduce CO2 and exhaust gas emissions through 
new technologies."
"This is why we are making substantial investments in climate-friendly alternative drive sys-
tems – especially battery-electric commercial vehicles and buses."
"The debate around driving bans for diesel vehicles in Germany has lost some of its heat given the strong 
improvements in air quality measurements."
"There were only two cities that failed to comply with the air pollutant 
limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) immissions in 2022."
"In some cases, these issues have been, and continue to be, 
the subject of legal proceedings."
"Individual cities throughout Germany have already imposed zonal traffic bans 
for older vehicles such as Euro-4/IV diesel."
"It is argued that only driving bans for diesel vehicles can bring about 
the necessary short-term reduction in NO2 immissions."
"The aforementioned debate could negatively affect sales 
of diesel vehicles and result in financial liabilities and possible official requirements."
"Local bans on the use of diesel vehicles are already also in place in a number of other countries, though these 
mainly affect older vehicles with lower emissions standards."
"Regulations in Belgium that successively ban older 
vehicles from larger cities are one example."
"In addition to major cities such as Paris and London, countries are 
also discussing future bans on vehicles with internal combustion engines."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
245 
Group Management Report 
A number of special environmental protection requirements apply to the Power Engineering segment."
"For example, 
the International Maritime Organization has issued the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution 
from Ships (MARPOL – MARine POLlution), which applies to ship engines."
"The permitted emissions are being 
lowered in phases under MARPOL ANNEX VI."
"A reduction of the sulfur content in marine fuel has been imple-
mented globally in recent years."
"Particularly stringent environmental regulations apply in emission control areas 
in Europe and the USA/Canada."
"Expansion to further regions such as the Mediterranean or Japan is being 
planned; other regions or territories such as the Black Sea, Alaska, Australia or South Korea are also in dis-
cussion."
"Moreover, emission limits are in force under Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 and in accordance with the 
regulations of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example."
"We are pushing for a maritime energy transition in specialist bodies and also promote this to the general 
public."
"In a first step, we are supporting the switch to liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel for maritime appli-
cations, and offer dual fuel and gas-powered engines for new and retrofitted vessels."
"For long-term, climate-
neutral operation of seagoing vessels, we advocate power-to-X technology, in which excess sustainably gene-
rated electricity is converted into carbon-neutral gas or liquid fuel, especially hydrogen, methanol or ammonia."
"As regards stationary equipment, there are a number of national rules in place worldwide that limit the 
emissions permitted in each case."
"On December 18, 2008, the World Bank Group set limits for gas and diesel 
engines in its Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Thermal Power Plants."
"These guidelines, which 
are currently being revised, are required to be applied in countries that have adopted no national requirements of 
their own or have requirements that are less stringent."
"In addition, the United Nations adopted the Convention 
on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution back in 1979, setting upper limits on total emissions as well as 
nitrogen oxide for the signatory states (including all EU states, other countries in Eastern Europe, the USA and 
Canada)."
These are also due for revision.
"Enhancements to the product portfolio in the Power Engineering seg-
ment focus on improving the efficiency and emissions reduction of equipment and systems."
"While adhering to 
current and future emissions requirements, we are advancing innovative energy solutions to actively shape the 
climate transition."
"Legal risks 
For this risk category, the likelihood of occurrence is classified as low (previous year: medium) and the potential 
extent of damage is classified as high (previous year: high)."
The most significant risks from the QRP are associated with the diesel issue.
"Litigation  
Volkswagen AG and the companies in which it is directly or indirectly invested are involved in a substantial 
number of legal disputes and governmental proceedings in Germany and abroad."
"Such legal disputes and other 
proceedings occur, among other things, in connection with products and services or in relation to employees, 
public authorities, dealers, investors, customers, suppliers, or other contracting parties."
"For the companies in 
question, these disputes and proceedings may result in payments such as fines or in other obligations or conse-
quences."
"In particular, substantial compensatory or punitive damages may have to be paid and cost-intensive 
measures may have to be implemented."
"In this context, specific estimation of the objectively likely consequences 
is often possible only to a very limited extent, if at all."
"Various legal proceedings are pending worldwide, particularly in the USA, in which customers are asserting 
purported product-related claims, either individually or in class actions."
"These claims are as a rule based on 
alleged vehicle defects, including defects alleged in vehicle parts supplied to the Volkswagen Group."
Compliance with legal or regulatory requirements is another area in which risks may arise.
"This is particularly 
true in gray areas where Volkswagen and the relevant public authorities may interpret the law differently."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
246 
Group Management Report 
In connection with their business activities, Volkswagen Group companies engage in constant dialogue with 
regulatory agencies, including the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA – German Federal Motor Transport Authority)."
"It is 
not possible to predict with assurance how government regulators will assess certain issues of fact and law in a 
particular situation."
"For this reason, the possibility that certain vehicle characteristics and/or type approval 
aspects may in particular ultimately be deemed deficient or impermissible cannot be ruled out."
"This is funda-
mentally a question of the regulatory agency’s specific evaluation in a concrete situation."
"A comparable challenge results from the tension between divergent national and international statutory or 
regulatory requirements regarding obligations to transfer information or documents, on the one hand, and 
privacy mandates under national and international data protection law on the other."
"Volkswagen is advised by 
outside law firms on these issues so as to preclude compliance violations as far as possible despite the some-
times unclear state of the law."
"Litigation may furthermore result from demands for more extensive climate protection measures or from 
allegedly incomplete disclosures regarding the impact of climate change."
"Risks may also result from actions for infringement of intellectual property, including infringement of patents, 
brands, or other third-party rights, particularly in Germany, before the Unified Patent Court and in the United 
States."
"Criminal acts by individuals, which even the best compliance management system can never completely 
prevent, are another potential source of legal risks."
"Appropriate insurance has been taken out to cover these risks where they were sufficiently definite and such 
coverage was economically sensible."
"Where necessary based on the information currently available, identified 
and correspondingly measurable risks have been reflected by recognizing provisions in amounts considered 
appropriate or disclosing contingent liabilities, as the case may be."
"As some risks cannot be assessed or can only 
be assessed to a limited extent, the possibility of material loss or damage not covered by the insured amounts or 
by provisions cannot be ruled out."
"This is, for instance, the case with regard to the legal risks assessed in 
connection with the diesel issue."
"Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the amounts disclosed for the litigation being reported on refer only to the 
respective principal claim."
"Ancillary claims, such as for interest and litigation expense, are generally not con-
sidered."
"In this context, Volkswagen AG 
announced that noticeable discrepancies between the figures recorded in testing and those measured in actual 
road use had been identified in type EA 189 diesel engines and that this engine type had been installed in 
roughly eleven million vehicles worldwide."
"On November 2, 2015, the EPA issued a “Notice of Violation” alleging 
that irregularities had also been discovered in the software installed in US vehicles with type V6 3.0 l diesel 
engines."
"This software function was developed and 
implemented from 2006 on without knowledge at the level of the Board of Management."
"Members of the Board 
of Management did not learn of the development and implementation of this software function until the summer 
of 2015."
"Rather, at the time the 2014 annual and 
consolidated financial statements were being prepared, the persons responsible for preparing these financial 
statements remained under the impression that the issue could be resolved with comparatively little expense."
"This culminated in Volkswagen's disclosure of a “defeat device” to the EPA and the California Air Resources 
Board (CARB), a department of the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of California, on September 3, 
2015."
"It 
therefore appeared to be manageable overall considering the business activities of the Volkswagen Group."
"This 
assessment by Volkswagen AG was based, among other things, on the advice of a law firm engaged in the USA 
for regulatory approval issues, according to which similar cases had in the past been amicably resolved with the 
US authorities."
"The EPA’s publication of the “Notice of Violation” on September 18, 2015, which the Board of 
Management had not expected, especially at that time, then presented the situation in an entirely different light."
"As a consequence of the diesel issue, numerous judicial and regulatory proceedings were initiated in various 
countries."
"Volkswagen has in the interim succeeded in making substantial progress and ending many of these 
proceedings."
"In the USA, Volkswagen AG and certain affiliates reached settlement agreements with various 
government authorities and private plaintiffs, the latter represented by a Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee in a 
multidistrict litigation in the US state of California."
"The agreements in question include various partial consent 
decrees as well as a plea agreement that resolved certain civil claims as well as criminal charges under US 
federal law and the laws of certain US states in connection with the diesel issue."
"Although Volkswagen is firmly 
committed to fulfilling the obligations arising from these agreements, a breach of these obligations cannot be 
completely ruled out."
"In the event of a violation, significant penalties could be imposed as stipulated in the 
agreements, in addition to the possibility of further monetary fines, criminal sanctions and injunctive relief."
"In agreement with the respective responsible authorities, the Volkswagen Group is making technical mea-
sures available worldwide for virtually all diesel vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"Following the studies carried out by AUDI AG to check all relevant diesel concepts for possible irregularities 
and retrofit potential, measures proposed by AUDI AG have been adopted and mandated by the KBA in various 
recall orders pertaining to vehicle models with V6 and V8 TDI engines."
"AUDI AG continues to anticipate that the 
total cost, including recall expenses, of the ongoing largely software-based retrofit program that began in July 
2017 will be manageable and has recognized corresponding balance-sheet risk provisions."
"AUDI AG has in the 
meantime developed software updates for many of the affected powertrains and, after approval by the KBA, 
already installed these updates in the vehicles of a large number of affected customers."
"KBA approval is still 
expected for the small number of software updates that are still pending."
"In connection with the diesel issue, potential consequences for Volkswagen’s results of operations, financial 
position and net assets could emerge primarily in the following legal areas: 
 
1."
"Criminal and administrative proceedings worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada) 
Criminal investigations, regulatory offense proceedings, and/or administrative proceedings have been com-
menced in some countries."
"Criminal investigations into the core factual issues are being conducted by the 
Offices of the Public Prosecutor in Braunschweig and Munich."
"Pursuant to a motion filed by the Braunschweig 
Office of the Public Prosecutor, the Braunschweig Regional Court reopened the proceedings against the former 
Chair of the Board of Management in December 2023."
"This case will move forward; the Braunschweig Regional 
Court has as yet set no date for commencement of the trial."
"In September 2020, the Braunschweig Regional Court allowed the indictment of the same former Chair of the 
Board of Management of Volkswagen AG to proceed on charges that include fraud in connection with the diesel 
issue involving type EA 189 engines."
"The proceedings against this former Chair of the Board of Management of 
Volkswagen AG have since been severed from the other cases."
"The trial of the other defendants began in 
September 2021."
"The Braunschweig Office of the Public Prosecutor conducted investigations on suspicion of fraud in connec-
tion with type EA 288 engines."
"The proceedings against the accused employees and against Volkswagen AG 
were terminated in late 2022 and early 2023, definitively against payment of a sum set by the court in the case 
of three of the accused persons and provisionally as regards four others."
"The trial before the Munich II Regional Court concluded in June 2023; the 
former Chair of the Board of Management of AUDI AG and the other two defendants were sentenced to prison 
terms, the enforcement of which was in each case suspended subject to probation."
"The conditions of probation 
include the payment of sums set by the court."
The judgment is not yet final.
"All three defendants have filed 
appeals on issues of law."
"The Office of the Public Prosecutor has likewise appealed the judgment against one of 
the defendants."
"In April 2023, the Munich II Regional Court had previously terminated the proceedings against 
an additional former defendant against payment of a sum set by the court."
"In August 2020, the Munich II Office of the Public Prosecutor issued a further indictment charging three 
former members of the Board of Management of AUDI AG and others with, among other things, fraud in 
connection with the diesel issue involving 3.0 l and 4.2 l TDI engines."
"The Munich II Regional Court has not yet 
decided whether to accept the indictment."
"As the type approval authority of proper jurisdiction, the KBA is moreover continuously testing Audi, Volks-
wagen, and Porsche brand vehicles for problematic functions."
"If certain functions are deemed impermissible by 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
249 
Group Management Report 
the KBA, the affected vehicles are recalled pursuant to a recall order or they are brought back into compliance by 
means of a voluntary service measure."
"In judgments rendered in July and November 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that a so-called 
thermal window (i.e."
"a temperature-dependent exhaust gas recirculation) in the range of 15°C and 33°C outside 
temperature represents a defeat device."
"In July and October 2023, the KBA issued two administrative rulings against AUDI AG in which 
it ruled that the originally incorporated thermal window version failed to meet the ECJ’s new vehicle engineering 
criterion in some of the affected vehicles."
"AUDI AG has appealed the rulings, and they are therefore not final."
"The 
KBA issued corresponding administrative rulings against Porsche AG in December 2023 and against Volks-
wagen AG in January 2024."
Porsche AG and Volkswagen AG have appealed the rulings.
"The Volkswagen Group 
had previously already begun rolling out software updates that modify the thermal window in accordance with 
the ECJ’s new vehicle engineering criterion and will continue to do so."
Altitude correction refers to altitude-dependent exhaust gas recirculation.
"The taxi switch modifies exhaust gas recirculation when a vehicle with a running engine stands motionless for a 
certain period of time."
Volkswagen AG is involved in the litigation as an interested party summoned.
"In late April 
2023, Volkswagen AG and the KBA filed appeals against the judgment of the Schleswig Administrative Court."
This decision is thus not legally final.
"DUH has filed two additional lawsuits with the Schleswig Administrative 
Court."
"The first action contests the notices of approval for further Audi and Porsche brand vehicles equipped 
with type EA 189 engines as well as with selected V-TDI engines; the second action is directed against all Group 
diesel vehicles with the Euro-5 and Euro-6b/c exhaust emission standard."
"In the first action, the Schleswig 
Administrative Court issued a judgment in January 2024 that extended its initial February 2023 decision to 
additional vehicles with type EA 189 engines and invalidated the KBA’s notices of approval for these vehicles."
The court granted both leave to appeal (on points of fact and law) and to leap-frog appeal (on points of law).
"This 
decision is thus not legally final."
"Moreover, additional administrative proceedings relating to the diesel issue are ongoing in other jurisdictions."
The companies of the Volkswagen Group are cooperating with the government authorities.
"Risks may furthermore result from possible decisions by the European Court of Justice construing EU type 
approval provisions."
"Whether the criminal and administrative proceedings will ultimately result in fines or other consequences for 
the Company, and if so what amounts these may entail, is currently subject to estimation risks."
"According to 
Volkswagen’s estimates, the likelihood that a sanction will be imposed is 50% or less in the majority of these 
proceedings."
"Contingent liabilities have therefore been disclosed where the amount of such liabilities could be 
measured and the likelihood of a sanction being imposed was assessed at not less than 10%."
"Product-related lawsuits worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada) 
A general possibility exists that customers in the affected markets will file civil lawsuits or that importers and 
dealers will assert recourse claims against Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group companies."
"Besides 
individual lawsuits, various forms of collective actions (i.e."
"assertion of individual claims by plaintiffs acting 
jointly or as representatives of a class) are available in various jurisdictions."
"Furthermore, in a number of markets 
  
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
250 
Group Management Report 
it is possible for consumer and/or environmental organizations to bring suit to enforce alleged rights to injunctive 
relief, declaratory judgment, or damages."
These actions asserted alleged rights to damages and other relief.
"The pending actions included in 
particular the following: 
Pending in Belgium is a class action filed by the Belgian consumer organization Test Aankoop VZW seeking 
repayment of the purchase price or damages in the alternative; an opt-out mechanism has been held to apply to 
this action."
"Given the opt-out rule, the class action potentially covers all vehicles with type EA 189 engines 
purchased by consumers on the Belgian market after September 1, 2014, unless the right to opt out is actively 
exercised."
The judgment is not yet final.
"In Brazil, two consumer protection class actions are pending."
"Following Volkswagen do 
Brasil’s appeal, the Superior Court of Justice vacated its own prior decision in its entirety."
"The case was 
remanded to the lower appellate court for rehearing of certain issues."
"Volkswagen do Brasil is permitted to intro-
duce new evidence."
"The judgment is enforceable, but remains non-final."
"In the second class action, which 
pertains to roughly 67 thousand later generation Amarok vehicles, the appeal filed by the plaintiff against the 
October 2021 trial court judgment dismissing its complaint was rejected by the appellate court in June 2023."
The plaintiff has appealed this decision to the Superior Court of Justice.
"Following the withdrawal of numerous motions for relief, approximately 
9 thousand claims are currently still pending."
"Provisions were recognized to account for the possibility that 
objectively valuable claims may again be raised in or out of court."
"These actions 
are in a very early procedural stage."
"No Group company has as yet been formally served with a complete state-
ment of the grounds of the complaint, and a number of the plaintiffs’ claims have yet to be specified in detail."
"This is an opt-in class action in which CLCV is primarily seeking rescission without 
compensation for use of the vehicle or, in the alternative, damages amounting to 20-30% of the purchase price."
"The judgment was largely overturned pursuant to the appeal filed 
by Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Group Italia."
"Per this decision, the consumers validly registered in the class 
action will receive merely €300 each."
"In the Netherlands, an opt-out class action is pending that was brought by Stichting Volkswagen Car Claim 
seeking declaratory rulings for up to 201 thousand customers."
"A declaratory judgment partially granting the 
relief sought was issued in July 2021."
"In the opinion of the court, Volkswagen AG and the other defendant Group 
companies acted unlawfully with respect to the original engine management software."
"The court moreover held 
that consumers are entitled to a purchase price reduction from the defendant dealerships."
"No specific payment 
obligations result from the declaratory judgment."
"Any individual claims would then have to be established 
afterwards in separate proceedings."
"Volkswagen AG and the other defendant Group companies appealed the 
decision."
"Furthermore, an opt-out class action lawsuit brought by the Diesel Emissions Justice Foundation 
(DEJF) seeking monetary damages on behalf of Dutch consumers is also pending; the action involves vehicles 
with type EA 189 engines, among others."
"The trial court rendered an interlocutory judgment in March 2022 
holding the new class action regime – which permits damage awards in addition to declaratory judgment on the 
existence of claims – to be inapplicable to the instant lawsuit."
"The interlocutory judgment further finds that the 
Amsterdam court lacks jurisdiction to hear lawsuits brought by consumers outside the Netherlands."
"The court 
suspended further trial level proceedings pending a decision by the appellate court."
"In Portugal, a Portuguese consumer organization had filed an opt-out class action potentially affecting up to 
approximately 70 thousand vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"In July 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed the 
class action as inadmissible because the plaintiff consumer organization lacked standing to sue."
"The judgment 
became final in September 2023."
"In South Africa, an opt-out class action seeking damages is pending; the action pertains to some 80 thou-
sand vehicles, including vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"Furthermore, individual lawsuits and similar proceedings are pending against Volkswagen AG and other 
Volkswagen Group companies in various countries; most of these lawsuits are seeking damages or rescission of 
the purchase contract."
"In Germany, roughly 25 thousand individual lawsuits relating to various diesel engine types are currently 
pending against Volkswagen AG or other Group companies, with the plaintiffs suing for damages or rescission of 
the contract in most cases."
"In 2020, the BGH issued a series of fundamental judgments deciding legal issues of major importance for the 
litigation still pending with regard to vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"The BGH held that buyers who had 
purchased vehicles prior to public disclosure of the diesel issue could return their vehicles to Volkswagen AG and 
receive a refund of the purchase price paid, less a deduction for the benefit derived from using the vehicle."
"How-
ever, buyers had no tort-based claim for damages if they purchased their vehicles after the ad hoc announce-
ment of September 22, 2015 or if they raise claims based solely on a temperature-dependent exhaust gas 
recirculation (so-called thermal window) in the engine."
"The BGH held 
that buyers must return their vehicles in order to claim payment and that such payment was reduced by the 
benefit derived from using the vehicle and by the dealer profit margin."
"In an additional fundamental judgment 
rendered in July 2022 concerning vehicles with EA 189 engines, the BGH held that buyers of new vehicles of 
other Group brands have no claim for residual damages against Volkswagen AG."
"The BGH held that the negligent use of an impermissible defeat device 
may in principle entitle plaintiffs to differential damages in tort amounting to 5% to 15% of their vehicle’s pur-
chase price."
Whether this claim is given in a particular instance is for the appeals courts to determine.
"The BGH 
stated that, when deciding whether a deactivation device was impermissible, it did not matter whether the limits 
in the NEDC testing procedure would be complied with even when system functioning was modified."
"The BGH 
held that liability does not arise where the manufacturer is not at fault, e.g."
"because the relevant public authority 
had approved the deactivation device in its specific configuration and taking account of identified combinations 
of deactivation devices, or would have done so upon request."
"Where a claim for differential damages exists in 
principle, the buyer must furthermore accept an offset for the benefit derived from using the vehicle and for the 
vehicle’s value to the extent these exceed the vehicle’s diminished value."
"An implemented software update may 
also potentially mitigate damages."
"Volkswagen estimates the likelihood that the plaintiffs will prevail to be 50% or less in the great majority of 
cases: customer class actions, complaints filed by consumer and/or environmental organizations, and individual 
lawsuits."
"Contingent liabilities are disclosed for these proceedings where the amount of such liabilities can be 
measured and the chance that the plaintiff will prevail was assessed as not remote."
"Given the early stage of the 
proceedings, it is in some cases not yet possible to quantify the realistic risk exposure."
"Furthermore, provisions 
were recognized to the extent necessary based on the current assessment."
"At this time, it cannot be estimated how many customers will choose to file lawsuits in the future in addition 
to those already pending and what prospect of success such lawsuits might have."
"Almost all investor lawsuits are now pending before the Braunschweig Regional Court or the Braunschweig 
Higher Regional Court."
"The investor lawsuits pending against 
Volkswagen AG in Germany are stayed pending resolution of the common issues, unless the cases can be 
dismissed for reasons independent of the common issues that are to be adjudicated in the model case pro-
ceedings."
"The resolution in the model case proceedings of the common questions of law and fact will be binding 
for the pending cases that have been stayed as described."
The model case plaintiff is Deka Investment GmbH.
"Oral argument in the model case proceedings before the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court began in 
September 2018."
"The Braunschweig Higher Regional Court issued several notification rulings stating its position 
on certain legal issues of fundamental importance for the litigation."
"In July 2023, the Braunschweig Higher 
Regional Court issued an order for the taking of evidence including the examination of numerous persons as well 
as the production and consultation of documents and records."
Volkswagen AG has the burden of proof on some issues.
"The taking of testimony commenced 
in September 2023."
"To date, none of the witnesses examined has testified to having personal knowledge or to 
knowledge on the part of persons with ad hoc disclosure responsibility."
"Several witnesses invoked a privilege 
against giving testimony."
"In some cases (not as to persons with ad hoc disclosure responsibility), the Braun-
schweig Higher Regional Court affirmed a comprehensive right to refuse to testify."
"The implications of the refusal 
to testify given Volkswagen AG’s burden of proof cannot be assessed abstractly."
"Pursuant to § 286 of the Code 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
253 
Group Management Report 
of Civil Procedure, the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court must decide at its discretion and conviction, taking 
account of the entire content of the hearings and the results of the evidence taken."
"Further investor lawsuits are pending before the Stuttgart Regional Court against Volkswagen AG, in some 
cases along with Porsche SE as joint and several debtor."
"An additional investor action for model declaratory 
judgment was filed with the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court against Porsche SE; Volkswagen AG is involved in 
this action as a third party intervening in support of a party to the dispute."
"The Wolverhampton City Council, 
Administrating Authority for the West Midlands Metropolitan Authorities Pension Fund, was appointed model 
case plaintiff."
The Stuttgart Higher Regional Court rendered a model declaratory judgment in late March 2023.
"Based on the determinations made in the model declaratory judgment and the current substantive status of the 
underlying actions, all of the suspended investor lawsuits against Porsche SE would in effect have to be dis-
missed."
The model declaratory judgment is not yet final.
"The model case plaintiff, several interested parties 
summoned, and Porsche SE petitioned the BGH for review on points of law."
"Volkswagen AG joined the pro-
ceedings as a third-party supporting the petition for review of Porsche SE."
"Excluding the United States and Canada, claims in connection with the diesel issue totaling roughly €9.2 bil-
lion are currently pending worldwide against Volkswagen AG in the form of investor lawsuits, judicial appli-
cations for dunning and conciliation procedures, and claims under the KapMuG."
"To date, claims in the high triple-
digit-millions range have been withdrawn or finally and conclusively dismissed."
"Volkswagen AG remains of the 
opinion that it duly complied with its capital market obligations."
"Therefore, no provisions have been recognized 
for these investor lawsuits."
"Contingent liabilities have been disclosed where the chance of success was 
estimated to be not less than 10%."
"In November 2023, Volkswagen reached a settlement agreement resolving the environmental claims brought 
by the Attorney General of the State of Texas and various Texas municipalities against Volkswagen AG, Volks-
wagen Group of America, Inc., and certain affiliates."
"The settlement agreement became final in January 2024 
after it was approved by the court."
"In November 2023, Volkswagen also finalized a settlement agreement 
resolving the environmental claims brought by two municipalities (Hillsborough County/Florida and Salt Lake 
County/Utah) against Volkswagen Group of America, Inc."
"In August 2020, the US District Court for the 
Northern District of California dismissed, among other things, all claims against VW Credit, Inc."
"relating to asset-
backed securities."
"In September 2020, the SEC filed an amended complaint that, among other things, removed 
the dismissed claims."
"In line with IAS 37.92, no statements have been made concerning estimates of financial impact or regarding 
uncertainty as to the amount or maturity of provisions and contingent liabilities in relation to proceedings in the 
USA/Canada."
This is so as to not compromise the results of the proceedings or the interests of the Company.
"Special audit 
In a November 2017 ruling, the Higher Regional Court of Celle ordered, upon the request of three US funds, the 
appointment of a special auditor for Volkswagen AG."
"Volkswagen AG had filed a constitutional complaint with the German Federal Constitutional 
Court against this decision, which was originally unappealable as formal matter."
"Volkswagen AG also filed a con-
stitutional complaint against the subsequent (and likewise formally unappealable) decision by the Higher 
Regional Court of Celle to appoint a special auditor other than the one initially appointed."
"Proceedings in the case concerning the 
replacement of the special auditor were suspended until the completion of the taking of evidence."
"Volks-
wagen AG had in addition previously filed an action before the Braunschweig Regional Court seeking to enjoin 
the special auditor from performing the audit as long as he had not furnished sufficient proof of his inde-
pendence."
"The Braunschweig Regional Court dismissed the action for injunctive relief in the summer of 2022; 
Volkswagen AG then appealed this decision to the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court."
"A second motion seeking appointment of a special auditor for Volkswagen AG to examine matters relating to 
the diesel issue was filed with the Regional Court of Hanover."
"The proceedings in this matter were resumed after 
initially being stayed pending the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in the first special audit case."
"Where adequately measurable at this stage, con-
tingent liabilities relating to the diesel issue have been disclosed in the notes in an aggregate amount of 
€4.0 (4.2) billion, whereby roughly €3.8 (3.6) billion of this amount results from lawsuits filed by investors in 
Germany."
"Should these legal or estimation risks materialize, this could result in further sub-
stantial financial charges."
"In particular, adjustment of the provisions recognized in light of knowledge acquired or 
events occurring in the future cannot be ruled out."
"In line with IAS 37.92, no further statements have been made concerning estimates of financial impact or 
regarding uncertainty as to the amount or maturity of provisions and contingent liabilities in relation to the diesel 
issue."
This is so as to not compromise the results of the proceedings or the interests of the Company.
"The damages being sought based on 
allegedly assigned rights currently amount to approximately €2.26 billion."
"In late September 2022 the 1st Anti-
trust Chamber of the Higher Regional Court of Celle issued a model case ruling by which all of the plaintiffs' 
objects of declaratory judgment were either dismissed or declared to be irrelevant."
"The legal positions of the 
model case defendants were thus upheld in their entirety."
"Two appeals alleging error of law in the model case 
ruling have been received, one of which is also directed against Volkswagen AG."
"In Brazil, the Brazilian tax authorities commenced tax proceedings against Volkswagen Truck & Bus (formerly: 
MAN Latin America); at issue in these proceedings are the tax consequences of the acquisition structure chosen 
for Volkswagen Truck & Bus in 2009."
"In December 2017, an adverse administrative appeal ruling was rendered 
against Volkswagen Truck & Bus."
Volkswagen Truck & Bus challenged this ruling before the regular court in 2018.
"Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
255 
Group Management Report 
Estimation of the risk in the event the tax authorities prevail on all points is subject to uncertainty because of 
differences in the amount of penalties and interest that might then apply under Brazilian law."
"However, a positive 
outcome for Volkswagen Truck & Bus remains the expectation."
"Should this not occur, a risk of about BRL 3.4 bil-
lion could result for the contested period from 2009 onwards; this amount has been included in contingent 
liabilities in the notes."
"In December 2023, the 
Brazilian dealership association Associação Brasileira Dos Distribuidores Volkswagen (Assobrav) and individual 
dealers, among others, filed lawsuits against Volkswagen do Brasil alleging that the dealers were at least 
partially entitled to the refunded amount."
Eight such actions are pending.
"The lawsuit brought by Assobrav with 
a provisionally estimated amount in dispute of roughly BRL 2.4 billion is by far the largest of these actions."
"In 
January 2024, the court dismissed the dealership association’s lawsuit in its entirety."
"Assobrav can appeal the 
dismissal; the judgment is not yet final."
"In 2011, the European Commission conducted searches at European truck manufacturers for suspected unlawful 
exchange of information during the period from 1997 to 2011; in November 2014, the Commission issued a 
statement of objections to MAN, Scania, and the other truck manufacturers concerned."
"In its settlement decision 
of July 2016, the European Commission assessed fines against five European truck manufacturers."
"MAN’s fine 
was waived in full as the company had informed the European Commission about the irregularities as a key 
witness."
"In September 2017, the European Commission fined Scania €0.88 billion."
"In a judgment rendered in 
February 2022, the European General Court (Court of First Instance) rejected in its entirety the appeal filed by 
Scania in this connection."
"Scania’s April 2022 appeal against this judgment was rejected in full by the European 
Court of Justice, the court of last resort, in February 2024."
"Furthermore, antitrust lawsuits seeking damages have 
been received from customers."
"As is the case in any antitrust proceedings, this may result in further lawsuits for 
damages."
"No provisions have been recognized for a large number of these legal disputes as they are not 
expected to result in final damage awards at the highest appeals level."
"For those actions in which, after re-
assessing the risks, the final outcome at the highest appeals level appears more likely than not to result in the 
payment of damages by MAN or Scania, provisions have been recognized in an amount of €89 million."
"Contin-
gent liabilities have not been disclosed as their quantification is not currently possible."
"This applies in particular 
to the proceedings that are currently in an early stage – including those as to which the process of expert 
assessment is still in an early stage."
"In July 2021, the European Commission assessed a fine totaling roughly €502 million against Volks-
wagen AG, AUDI AG, and Dr. Ing."
Porsche AG pursuant to a settlement decision.
"Volkswagen declined to 
file an appeal, hence the decision became final in 2021."
"The manufacturers are not charged with any other misconduct such as price fixing 
or allocating markets and customers."
"Following the European Commission’s July 2021 administrative fine 
decision, several class actions were filed in the United Kingdom beginning in late 2021 against Volkswagen AG, 
among others."
Service of the complaints is expected in the course of 2024.
"Neither provisions nor contingent 
liabilities have been stated as a realistic estimate of risk exposure is not possible at the present stage of the 
proceedings."
"After analyzing potential violations based on the facts of the EU case, the Korean competition 
authority KFTC issued its administrative fine decision in April 2023."
"No fine was imposed on Volkswagen AG,  
 
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
256 
Group Management Report 
and Porsche AG is not affected by the decision."
"A fine equaling just under €3 million was assessed against 
AUDI AG."
AUDI AG and Volkswagen AG have appealed the decision to the relevant court in Seoul/Korea.
"The written grounds of the final 
decision are not yet available."
"Volkswagen AG, AUDI AG, and Porsche AG have filed appeals."
"Based on com-
parable matters, the Chinese competition authority has instituted proceedings against Volkswagen AG, AUDI AG, 
and Porsche AG, among others, and issued requests for information."
"In March 2022, the European Commission and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the English 
antitrust authorities, searched the premises of various automotive manufacturers and automotive industry 
organizations and/or served them with formal requests for information."
"In the Volkswagen Group, the investi-
gation affects Volkswagen Group UK, which was searched by the CMA, and Volkswagen AG, which has received 
a Group-wide information request from the European Commission."
"Also 
alleged is an agreement to refrain from competitive use of ELV issues, that is, not to publicize relevant recycling 
data (recyclates, recyclability, recovery) for competitive purposes."
"The violation under investigation is alleged to 
have taken place in particular in the “ACEA” Working Group Recycling and related sub-groups thereof."
"Volks-
wagen AG is responding to the European Commission’s information requests."
"Volkswagen Group UK is cooper-
ating with the CMA."
"In this matter, CMA furthermore issued requests for information to Volkswagen AG."
"In 
July 2022, Volkswagen AG filed an action for judicial review challenging the CMA's requests for information in 
particular because Volkswagen AG believes that they exceed the CMA's jurisdiction."
"In February 2023, the court 
granted the claim."
"The CMA appealed this judgment in April 2023, and in January 2024 the appellate court ruled 
in the CMA’s favor."
Volkswagen AG is considering whether to appeal this decision.
"Concurrent therewith, Volks-
wagen AG continues to examine the possibilities for reasonable cooperation with the CMA."
"In addition, a few national and international authorities initiated antitrust investigations."
"Volkswagen is 
cooperating closely with the responsible authorities in these investigations."
"An assessment of the underlying 
situation is not possible at this early stage."
Porsche AG has discovered potential regulatory issues relating to vehicles for various markets worldwide.
"There 
are questions as to the permissibility of specific hardware and software components used in type approval 
measurements."
Differences compared with production versions may also have occurred in certain cases.
"Based 
on the information presently available, current production is not affected, however."
"The issues are unrelated to 
the defeat devices that were at the root of the diesel issue."
"A large number of the issues have already been 
completed."
"In November 2021, three claimants accompanied by Greenpeace filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen AG before 
the Braunschweig Regional Court."
"The lawsuit further sought to compel Volkswagen 
to exercise influence over Group companies, subsidiaries, and joint ventures so as to cause them to fulfill these 
demands as well."
"In February 2023, the Braunschweig Regional Court dismissed the action as unfounded."
"In 
addition, another action with similar requests for relief and by and large the same rationale has been filed 
  
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
257 
Group Management Report 
against Volkswagen AG by an organic farmer with the support of Greenpeace before the Detmold Regional 
Court."
This action was likewise dismissed as unfounded by the Detmold Regional Court in February 2023.
"The 
plaintiffs filed appeals against the judgments dismissing their complaints (appeals filed in March 2023 with the 
Braunschweig Higher Regional Court and in April 2023 with the Hamm Higher Regional Court)."
"In Russia, Automobile Plant GAZ LLC (GAZ) had initially filed several judicial proceedings against Volkswagen AG 
and others in the reporting year alleging damage claims totaling around RUB 44 billion."
"In this connection, GAZ 
applied for and in some cases initially obtained protective measures relating to the shares in Volkswagen Group 
Rus OOO (VGR) as well as to the movable and immovable property of VGR; the courts have since either rejected 
or vacated these measures."
"GAZ had appealed these decisions rejecting or vacating protective measures relative 
to the movable and immovable property of VGR; these appeals have since been finally and conclusively rejected."
"In May 2023, Volkswagen AG completed the sale of its shares in VGR and its local subsidiaries to Art-Finance 
LLC; thereby transferring title to the shares in VGR and its local subsidiaries to the buyer upon registration of the 
transaction."
VGR was renamed AGR LLC in June 2023.
"In fulfillment of a court-confirmed settlement, GAZ has 
since withdrawn its complaint in the first lawsuit, thus terminating these proceedings."
"Volkswagen AG continues 
to defend the remaining second lawsuit, in which it is the sole defendant and alleged claims of approximately 
RUB 28.5 billion are at stake."
"Provisions were recognized by Volkswagen Bank GmbH and Volkswagen Leasing GmbH for possible claims in 
connection with financial services provided to consumers."
"These relate to actions involving certain features of 
customer loan and leasing agreements that may toll the running of the statutory cancellation time periods."
"In line with IAS 37.92, no further statements have been made concerning estimates of financial impact or 
regarding uncertainty as to the amount or maturity of provisions and contingent liabilities in relation to addi-
tional important legal cases."
"This is so as to not compromise the results of the proceedings or the interests of the 
Company."
"Tax risks 
Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries have operations worldwide and are audited by local tax authorities on an 
ongoing basis."
"Amendments to tax laws and changes in legal precedent and their interpretation by the tax 
authorities in the respective countries may lead to tax payments that differ from the estimates made in the 
financial statements."
"Risks arise particularly from tax assessment of the cross-border supply of intragroup goods 
and services."
"Through organizational measures, such as the implementation of an advance pricing agreement, as 
well as the monitoring of transfer prices, Volkswagen constantly monitors the development of tax risks, as well 
as the impact thereof on the consolidated financial statements."
"Tax provisions were recognized for potential future retrospective tax payments, while other provisions were 
recognized for ancillary tax payments arising in this connection."
"The Volkswagen Group is aware of its social responsibility to comply with tax regulations (tax compliance) 
and is committed to being a responsible and reliable taxpayer (tax governance)."
"The organizational principles relating to the Volkswagen Group’s tax affairs are set out in the Group’s Tax 
Policy, which is reviewed annually to verify that it is up to date."
"This policy also contains uniform requirements for 
the implementation of a Group-wide Tax Compliance Management System, which must be followed by the Group 
companies and serves to monitor adherence to tax regulations."
"The organizational principles defined therein are  
 
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
258 
Group Management Report 
designed to ensure that tax-related financial and regulatory as well as any resulting reputational risks can be 
identified and evaluated."
"These risks are communicated, proactively managed and monitored, and are compre-
hensively incorporated into our risk management processes and systems."
"The Board of Management has also published its tax strategy principles, which focus in particular on correct 
fulfillment of tax obligations."
"Among other things, these principles require Group companies to conduct trans-
actions with each other at arm’s length in order to satisfy relevant OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises."
"Inappropriate legal arrangements, and particularly an “aggressive” tax strategy muste be avoided."
"Financial risks 
For this risk category, the likelihood of occurrence is classified as high and the potential extent of damage is clas-
sified as medium."
No risks with a score of more than 20 were reported for this risk category in the previous year.
The most significant risks from the QRP arise in particular from volatile foreign exchange markets.
"Management of these financial risks and of liquidity risks is 
the central responsibility of the Group Treasury department, which reduces these risks using nonderivative and 
derivative financial instruments."
"The Board of Management is informed of the current risk situation at regular 
intervals."
Interest rate risk refers to potential losses that could arise as a result of changes in market interest rates.
"It 
occurs because of interest rate mismatches between asset and liability items in a portfolio or on the balance 
sheet."
"The principle of 
matching amounts and maturities applies to financing arrangements within the Volkswagen Group in the Auto-
motive Division."
"In the Financial Services Division, the risk of changes in the interest rate is managed on the basis 
of limits using interest rate derivatives as part of the defined risk strategy."
"Foreign currency risk is reduced in particular through natural hedging, i.e."
"by adapting our production 
capacity at our locations around the world, establishing new production facilities in the most important currency 
regions and also procuring a large percentage of components locally."
"We hedge the residual exchange rate risk 
using hedging instruments."
These mainly comprise currency forwards and currency options.
"We use these trans-
actions to limit the exchange rate risk associated with forecasted cash flows from operating activities, intragroup 
financing and liquidity positions in currencies other than the respective functional currency, for example as a 
result of restrictions on capital movements."
"The currency forwards and currency options can have a term of up to 
ten years."
"At year-end 2023, there were no more hedges for the Russian ruble."
The hedging of commodity prices entails risks relating to the availability of raw materials and price trends.
"Particularly against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle East, we 
continuously analyze potential risks arising from changes in commodity and energy prices in the market so that 
immediate action can be taken whenever these arise."
"We limit these risks particularly by entering into forward 
transactions and swaps."
"We have used appropriate contracts to hedge some of our requirements for com-
modities such as aluminum, coal, copper and lead over a period of up to six years."
"We have also entered into 
  
 
 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
259 
Group Management Report 
price hedges for cobalt, lithium and coal with maximum terms of less than three years."
"In the case of nickel, the 
strategic hedging horizon is up to ten years, although existing hedges focus particularly on the next six years."
Appropriate contracts have also been put in place to hedge prices of electricity and gas deliveries.
"The precious metals platinum, palladium and rhodium have shorter hedging periods, generally amounting to 
a maximum of up to three years."
"For selected commodities, this may also involve increases in physical invent-
tories."
"We have also entered into transactions for emission allowances to hedge the prices of a portion of the CO2 
emissions generated beyond the free allocations as part of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU 
ETS) over the coming years."
"Special funds, in which we invest surplus liquidity, entail equity price risks and fund price risks in particular."
"We reduce these risks through the diversified investment of funds and through minimum values set out in the 
respective investment guidelines."
"In addition, exchange rates are hedged when market conditions are appropri-
ate."
"In the notes to the consolidated financial statements we explain our hedging policy, the hedging rules and 
the default and liquidity risks, and quantify the hedging transactions mentioned."
"We also disclose information on 
market risk within the meaning of IFRS 7 in the same section."
"Risks arising from financial instruments 
Channeling excess liquidity into investments and entering into derivatives contracts gives rise to counterparty 
risk."
"Partial or complete failure by a counterparty to perform its obligation to pay interest and repay principal, for 
example, would have a negative impact on the Volkswagen Group’s earnings and liquidity."
"We counter this risk 
through our counterparty risk management, which we describe in more detail in the section entitled “Principles 
and Goals of Financial Management” in the “Results of Operations, Financial Position and Net Assets” chapter."
"The financial instruments held for hedging purposes give rise to both counterparty risks and balance sheet risks, 
which we limit using hedge accounting."
"By diversifying when selecting business partners, we work to limit the impact of a default and keep the Volks-
wagen Group solvent at all times, even in the event of a default by individual counterparties."
"The use of financial instruments may result in losses if the hedging exchange rates are less favorable than the 
rates achievable on the market at the maturity of the financial instrument."
"Risks arising from trade receivables and from financial services are explained in more detail in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements."
"Liquidity risk 
Volkswagen is reliant on its ability to adequately cover its financing needs."
"In principle, the Automotive Division and Financial Services Division refinance themselves independently of 
one another."
"However, they are subject to very similar refinancing risks."
"In the Automotive Division, the Com-
pany’s solvency is primarily safeguarded through retained, non-distributed earnings, by drawing down on credit 
lines and by issuing financial instruments on the money and capital markets."
"The capital requirements of the 
financial services business are covered mainly by raising funds in the national and international financial mar-
kets, as well as through customer deposits from the direct banking business."
"One of the ways in which Volkswagen finances its projects is with loans provided by national development 
banks such as Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) or Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social 
(BNDES), or by supranational development banks."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities  
 
260 
Group Management Report 
In addition to fully committed credit lines, uncommitted credit lines from commercial banks supplement our 
broadly diversified refinancing structure."
The increasing relevance of ESG ratings to investors is also of growing significance in this context.
"In such 
cases, there is a risk of a fall in demand from market participants for securities issued by Volkswagen, which may 
additionally have a detrimental effect on the interest rates payable and restrict access to the capital market."
"Risks and opportunities in the financial services business 
While carrying out our financial services activities, we are primarily exposed to residual value risks and credit 
risks."
"A residual value risk arises when the expected fair value for the disposal of the lease or finance asset may be 
lower than the residual value set at contract conclusion."
"However, there is also a possibility that disposal of the 
asset will generate more income than calculated for the residual value."
"Referring to the bearer of residual value risk, a distinction is made between direct and indirect residual value 
risks."
"A direct residual value risk means that our financial services companies directly bear this risk (as outlined 
in the contract)."
"An indirect residual value risk occurs when, based on a residual value guarantee, the residual 
value risk has passed to a third party, such as a dealer."
"In such cases, there is an initial counterparty default risk 
associated with this third party (the residual value guarantor)."
"If the guarantor defaults, the residual value risk 
passes to our financial services companies."
"Management of the residual value risk is based on a defined control cycle, which ensures that risks are fully 
assessed, monitored, responded to and communicated."
"This process structure enables us to manage residual 
risks professionally and also to systematically improve and enhance the way we handle residual value risks."
"As part of our risk management efforts, the appropriateness of the risk provision is assessed regularly, as is 
the residual value risk potential."
"In the process, we compare the contractually agreed residual values with the 
obtainable fair values."
"These are determined utilizing data from external service providers and our own mar-
keting data."
"We do not take possible gains on residual market values into account when recognizing risk pro-
visions."
"Based on the resulting potential residual value risk, a variety of measures are initiated in order to limit 
this risk."
"With regard to new business, the residual value recommendation must take into account current market 
circumstances and factors that might have an influence in future."
"Credit risk describes the risk of losses due to defaults in customer transactions, specifically by the borrower 
or lessee."
Default occurs when the borrower or lessee is unable or unwilling to make the payments due.
"This 
includes late or partial payment of interest and principal on the part of the contracting party."
Credit checks on borrowers are the primary basis for lending decisions.
"Rating and scoring systems are used 
to provide an objective decision-making basis for granting loans and leases and for recognizing risk provisions."
"An opportunity may arise if the losses from the lending and leasing business are lower than the previously 
calculated expected losses and the risk provision recognized on this basis."
"Particularly in those countries in 
which we take a conservative approach to risk due to the uncertain economic situation, the realized losses may 
be lower than the expected losses if the economy stabilizes and borrowers’ credit ratings improve as a result."
"As such, commitments are managed according to the degree of risk 
involved (standard, intensified and problem loan management)."
"More information on risks in the financial services business can be found in the 2023 annual reports of Volks-
wagen Financial Services AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH."
"Opportunities and risks from mergers & acquisitions and/or other strategic 
partnerships/investments 
No risks with a score of 20 or more were reported for this risk category in the reporting year."
"Opportunities and risks from partnerships 
As part of our NEW AUTO strategy, we are stepping up our efforts to forge partnerships, both for the transforma-
tion of our core business and for the establishment of the new mobility solutions business."
"In the field of battery cells, risks could arise from potential disagreement with our partners, possible delays in 
battery cell development or delayed battery cell production."
"Close interaction with partners in the field of e-mobility in the form of partnerships and joint ventures sup-
ports technological change."
Examples include the development of a comprehensive charging infrastructure.
"This 
cooperation involves risks such as an increased coordination workload, more complex decision-making proces-
ses and the loss of expertise."
"At the same time, opportunities are presented by the pooling of specialist knowl-
edge, by horizontal and vertical integration and by better use of resources."
"Volkswagen has therefore created 
various teams in Group Components to closely support all such partnerships."
"The marketing of the Modular Electric Drive Toolkit to third parties, for example as part of the strategic alli-
ance with Ford, could result in damage claims in the event of problems with procurement, production and quality."
"We are concentrating to a greater extent on partnerships, acquisitions, and venture capital investments."
"Our 
intent here is to generate maximum value for the Group and its brands and to enable us to expand our expertise, 
particularly in new areas of business."
Our innovative presence in the markets supports this process.
"We enter 
into partnerships at a local level to help us identify regional customer needs more accurately, establish 
competitive cost structures and thus develop and offer market-driven products."
"At the same time, partnerships 
are associated with the risk that the interests of our business partners might differ from our own or that common 
goals cannot be reached."
"Furthermore, specific risks and expenses may arise from the provision of data and sys-
tems in new development partnerships in a way that meets the requirements of the relevant jurisdictions (e.g."
national data protection law) and roles (e.g.
the need-to-know principle of the Volkswagen Group).
"To mitigate 
the aforementioned risks, development partnerships receive not only technical support but also assistance on 
legal and IT-related aspects."
Volkswagen owns a large number of patents and other industrial property rights and copyrights.
"Patent and 
licensing infringements may also arise in partnerships and thus result in the unauthorized disclosure of com-
pany-specific expertise."
Volkswagen monitors the sales markets and also protects its expertise with legal action.
"Volkswagen tests at least once a year on the basis of underlying 
cash-generating units, whether the value of the goodwill or the brand names could have been impaired."
"We also 
regularly test the equity investments for impairment."
"If there are objective indications that the 
recoverable amount of the asset concerned is lower than the carrying amount, Volkswagen recognizes this as a 
non-cash impairment."
"An impairment can be caused, for example, by an increase in interest rates or deteriorating 
business prospects."
"Risks from the disposal of equity investments 
An unexpected need for funding may lead to a situation in which assets have to be sold for a lower amount not 
equivalent to their value."
"OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY POSITION  
The Volkswagen Group’s overall risk and opportunity position results from the specific risks and opportunities 
shown above."
"We have established a comprehensive risk management system to ensure that these risks are 
controlled."
"The Volkswagen 
Group continues to be exposed to risks from the diesel issue."
"In 2024, an adverse effect may result from the 
continued limited availability of parts, energy and other raw materials, as well as from geopolitical tensions and 
conflicts, including from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle East."
"Taking into 
account all the information known to us at present, no risks exist which could pose a threat to the continued 
existence of significant Group companies or the Volkswagen Group."
This annual report contains forward-looking statements on the business development of the Volkswagen Group.
"The estimates given entail a degree of risk, and actual developments may differ from 
those forecast."
"Any changes in significant parameters relating to our key sales markets, or any significant shifts in exchange rates, energy and other commodities or the supply of parts 
relevant to the Volkswagen Group will have a corresponding effect on the development of our business."
"Outlook for 2024  
 
263 
Group Management Report 
Our planning is based on the assumption that global economic output will grow overall in 2024 compared with 
2023, albeit at a slower pace."
"The persistently high inflation in major economic regions and the resulting restric-
tive monetary policy measures taken by central banks are expected to dampen consumer demand."
"We continue 
to believe that risks will arise from protectionist tendencies, turbulence in the financial markets and structural 
deficits in individual countries."
"In addition, continuing geopolitical tensions and conflicts are weighing on 
growth prospects; risks are associated in particular with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in 
the Middle East."
"We assume that both the advanced economies and the emerging markets will show positive 
momentum on average, but with below-average growth in gross domestic product (GDP)."
The trend in the automotive industry closely follows global economic developments.
"We assume that com-
petition in the international automotive markets will intensify further."
"Crisis-related disruption to the global 
supply chain and the resulting impact on vehicle availability may weigh on the volume of new registrations."
Uncertainty may also arise from shortages of intermediates and commodities.
"These may be further exacerbated 
by the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle East and may, in partic-
ular, lead to rising prices for materials and a declining availability of energy."
"We predict that trends in the markets for passenger cars in the individual regions will be mixed but predomi-
nantly positive in 2024."
"Overall, the global volume of new car sales is expected to be slightly higher than in the 
previous year."
"For 2024, we anticipate that the volume of new passenger car registrations in Western Europe will 
be slightly higher than that recorded in the reporting year."
"In the German passenger car market, we expect the 
volume of new registrations in 2024 to also be slightly up on the prior-year level."
"Sales of passenger cars in 2024 
are expected to significantly exceed the prior-year figures overall in markets in Central and Eastern Europe  
– subject to the further development of the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
"The volume of sales in the markets for pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles (up to 6.35 tonnes) in North America in 2024 is forecast to be slightly 
higher than the level seen the previous year."
"We also anticipate a slight increase in new registrations in the South 
American markets in 2024 compared with the previous year."
"Likewise, the passenger car markets in the Asia-
Pacific region are expected to be slightly up on the prior-year level in 2024."
"Trends in the markets for light commercial vehicles in the individual regions will be mixed; on the whole, we 
expect the sales volume for 2024 to be slightly above the previous year’s figure."
"A noticeable year-on-year increase in demand is 
anticipated for 2024 in the bus markets relevant for the Volkswagen Group, whereby this will vary depending on 
the region."
We assume that automotive financial services will prove highly important to global vehicle sales in 2024.
"In a challenging market environment, we anticipate that deliveries to customers by the Volkswagen Group in 
2024 will increase by up to 3% compared to the previous year."
"Challenges will arise in particular from the economic situation, the increasing intensity of competition, 
volatile commodity, energy and foreign exchange markets, and more stringent emissions-related requirements."
"We expect the sales revenue of the Volkswagen Group and the Passenger Cars Business Area to exceed the 
previous year’s figure by up to 5% in 2024."
"The operating return on sales for the Volkswagen Group and the Pas-
senger Cars Business Area is likely to be between 7.0% and 7.5%."
"For the Commercial Vehicles Business Area, we 
anticipate an operating return on sales of 8.5% to 9.5%, also amid a year-on-year increase of up to 5% in sales 
revenue."
"In the Power Engineering Business Area, we expect sales revenue to be up to 2% above the prior-year 
figure and operating profit to be in the low three-digit-million euro range."
"For the Financial Services Division, we 
forecast an increase of 3–7% in sales revenue compared with the prior year and an operating result in the range 
of €4.0 billion."
"In the Automotive Division, we are assuming an investment ratio of between 13.5% and 14.5% in 2024."
"We 
expect net cash flow in 2024 to be between €4.5 billion and €6.5 billion."
"This will include in particular invest-
ments for the future and cash outflows from mergers and acquisitions for the battery business field, which are a 
vital pillar of the Volkswagen Group’s transformation."
"Net liquidity in the Automotive Division in 2024 is expected 
to be between €39 billion and €41 billion."
"Our goal remains unchanged, namely, to continue with our robust 
financing and liquidity policy."

Explanatory notes on the cash flow statement are presented in the section relating to the cash flow statement.
The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year.
In accordance with Regulation No.
"1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Volkswagen AG 
prepared its consolidated financial statements for 2023 in compliance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union."
"All the IFRSs adopted by the EU and required to be applied 
have been complied with."
The accounting policies applied in the previous year were generally retained.
The only changes required resulted from new or amended standards.
"Moreover, all the provisions of German commercial law that Volkswagen is additionally required to apply, as 
well as the German Corporate Governance Code, have been complied with in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements."
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in euros.
"Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are given 
in millions of euros (€ million)."
"All figures shown are rounded, so minor discrepancies may arise from addition of these amounts."
The income statement was prepared using the internationally accepted cost of sales method.
"The consolidated financial statements provide a true and fair view of the net assets, financial posi-
tion and results of operations as well as the cash flows of the Volkswagen Group."
"The Board of Management completed preparation of the consolidated financial statements on February 20, 
2024."
"On that date, the period ended in which adjusting events after the reporting period are recognized."
"Effects of new and amended IFRSs 
Volkswagen AG has applied all accounting pronouncements adopted by the EU and effective for periods begin-
ning in fiscal year 2023."
"Amendments to IAS 12 have had to be applied since January 1, 2023; they result from an agreement made by 
around 140 countries to implement global minimum taxation (Pillar Two)."
"A temporary exemption from accounting 
for deferred taxes was embedded in IAS 12, which applies if the deferred taxes arise from the implementation of 
Pillar Two by the countries concerned."
"More information on Pillar Two can be found in the “Income tax income/ 
expense” section."
"Also applicable since January 1, 2023 are amendments to IAS 12 that relate to deferred taxes on right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities as well as decommissioning and restoration liabilities."
"They require deferred taxes to 
be recognized when the relevant assets and liabilities are initially recognized."
"In addition to this, amendments were made to IAS 1 that have also been applicable since January 1, 2023."
"Essentially, these amendments are aimed at making disclosures on accounting policies more company-specific 
and therefore more useful for decision-making by narrowing the definition of materiality."
"The Volkswagen Group’s 
disclosures on accounting policies have been revised against this backdrop."
"In particular, generally worded disclo-
sures derived from the IFRS standards have been reduced to a minimum."
"275 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
Furthermore, amendments to IAS 8 have been in force since January 1, 2023, which provide greater clarity on the 
distinction between changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates."
"The amendments referred to above do not materially affect the Volkswagen Group’s net assets, financial posi-
tion and results of operations."
"IFRS 17 – INSURANCE CONTRACTS 
IFRS 17 specifies new accounting rules for insurance contracts."
"The Volkswagen Group applied IFRS 17 as of 
January 1, 2023 for the first time."
"The transition was conducted using the full retrospective approach, unless 
using that approach was impracticable."
"This was the case when not all of the required historical information, in 
particular for multiyear contracts, was available without undue cost and effort."
"In these instances, the 
Volkswagen Group generally used the modified retrospective approach."
"The Volkswagen Group mainly conducts primary insurance and reinsurance business in the warranty and repair 
cost insurance class and reinsurance business in the residual debt insurance class."
"In addition, there are vehicle 
liability insurance portfolios, although almost all of them are in the process of being wound down."
Liabilities are mainly measured using the general measurement model.
"The data required for this purpose is 
determined using common actuarial methods, such as the chain ladder method."
The Volkswagen Group uses the bottom-up approach to calculate the discount rate.
"For the insurance business, 
the risk-free yield curve is generally derived from overnight index swaps of the currency in which the underlying 
insurance contracts have been entered into."
"For contracts with the primary purpose of providing services at a fixed price (referred to as fixed-fee service 
contracts), the Volkswagen Group exercises the option to present these service contracts in accordance with 
IFRS 15."
"Similarly, for loan agreements that transfer a significant insurance risk of the borrower, the option to ac-
count for them under IFRS 9 has been exercised."
"First-time application resulted in an insignificant change in equity as of January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2022, 
respectively."
"This is due primarily to the changed methodology for calculating liabilities related to the insurance 
business."
"In addition, netting cash flows when measuring the liabilities also led to an equal reduction of €0.7 bil-
lion in assets and liabilities related to the insurance business."
"The change in the methodology for recognizing 
income and expenses does not have any material effect on the income statement."
"Prior-year figures have been 
adjusted accordingly."

1 Effective date from Volkswagen AG’s perspective."
"In this context, Volkswagen AG  
announced that noticeable discrepancies between the figures recorded in testing and those measured in actual 
road use had been identified in type EA 189 diesel engines and that this engine type had been installed in roughly 
eleven million vehicles worldwide."
"On November 2, 2015, the EPA issued a “Notice of Violation” alleging that 
irregularities had also been discovered in the software installed in US vehicles with type V6 3.0 l diesel engines."
"The so-called diesel issue is rooted in a modification of parts of the software of the relevant engine control 
units – which, according to Volkswagen AG’s legal position, is only unlawful under US law – for the type EA 189 
diesel engines that Volkswagen AG was developing at that time."
"This software function was developed and  
implemented from 2006 on without knowledge at the level of the Board of Management."
"Members of the Board of 
Management did not learn of the development and implementation of this software function until the summer of 
2015."
"Rather, at the time the 2014 annual and consolidated 
financial statements were being prepared, the persons responsible for preparing these financial statements  
remained under the impression that the issue could be resolved with comparatively little expense."
"This culminated in Volkswagen's disclosure of a “defeat device” to the EPA and the California Air Resources 
Board (CARB), a department of the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of California, on September 3, 
2015."
"It therefore  
appeared to be manageable overall considering the business activities of the Volkswagen Group."
"This assessment 
by Volkswagen AG was based, among other things, on the advice of a law firm engaged in the USA for regulatory 
approval issues, according to which similar cases had in the past been amicably resolved with the US authorities."
"The EPA’s publication of the “Notice of Violation” on September 18, 2015, which the Board of Management had 
not expected, especially at that time, then presented the situation in an entirely different light."
"In fiscal year 2023, there were no material special items in connection with the diesel issue."
Further information on the litigation in connection with the diesel issue can be found in the “Litigation” section.
"In its settlement decision of 
July 2016, the European Commission assessed fines against five European truck manufacturers."
"MAN’s fine was 
waived in full as the company had informed the European Commission about the irregularities as a key witness."
"In September 2017, the European Commission fined Scania €0.88 billion."
"In a judgment rendered in February 
2022, the European General Court (Court of First Instance) rejected in its entirety the appeal filed by Scania in this 
connection."
"Scania’s April 2022 appeal against this judgment was rejected in full by the European Court of Justice, 
the court of last resort, in February 2024."
"Furthermore, antitrust lawsuits seeking damages have been received from customers."
"As is the case in any 
antitrust proceedings, this may result in further lawsuits for damages."
"No provisions have been recognized for a 
large number of these legal disputes as they are not expected to result in final damage awards at the highest 
appeals level."
"For those actions in which, after re-assessing the risks, the final outcome at the highest appeals 
level appears more likely than not to result in the payment of damages by MAN or Scania, provisions have been 
recognized in an amount of €89 million."
"Contingent liabilities have not been disclosed as their quantification is 
not currently possible."
"This applies in particular to the proceedings that are currently in an early stage – including 
those as to which the process of expert assessment is still in an early stage."
"In March 2022, the European Commission and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the English antitrust 
authorities, searched the premises of various automotive manufacturers and automotive industry organizations 
and/or served them with formal requests for information."
"In the Volkswagen Group, the investigation affects 
Volkswagen Group UK, which was searched by the CMA, and Volkswagen AG, which has received a Group-wide 
information request from the European Commission."
"Also alleged is an agreement to refrain 
from competitive use of ELV issues, that is, not to publicize relevant recycling data (recyclates, recyclability,  
recovery) for competitive purposes."
"The violation under investigation is alleged to have taken place in particular 
in the “ACEA” Working Group Recycling and related sub-groups thereof."
"Volkswagen AG is responding to the 
European Commission’s information requests."
Volkswagen Group UK is cooperating with the CMA.
"In this matter, 
CMA furthermore issued requests for information to Volkswagen AG."
"In July 2022, Volkswagen AG filed an action 
for judicial review challenging the CMA's requests for information in particular because Volkswagen AG believes 
that they exceed the CMA's jurisdiction."
"In February 2023, the court granted the claim."
"The CMA appealed this 
judgment in April 2023, and in January 2024 the appellate court ruled in the CMA’s favor."
"Volkswagen AG is 
considering whether to appeal this decision."
"Concurrent therewith, Volkswagen AG continues to examine the 
possibilities for reasonable cooperation with the CMA."
"In addition, a few national and international authorities initiated antitrust investigations."
"Volkswagen is coop-
erating closely with the responsible authorities in these investigations."
"An assessment of the underlying situation 
is not possible at this early stage."

RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT 
The start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022 led not only to a humanitarian crisis but also brought 
market upheaval around the world."
"There have been substantial price rises, particularly on the energy and com-
modity markets, and significant increases in interest and inflation rates have been observed internationally."
"There 
were some signs of normalization in the markets during the course of fiscal year 2023."
"Against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting consequences, Volkswagen had decided 
to suspend vehicle production in Russia for the time being."
Vehicle exports to Russia have also been halted.
"In 
addition, the respective sanction requirements must also be complied with in relation to parts supplies and the 
provision of technical information."
There was again no easing of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in fiscal year 2023.
"For this reason, the discontinua-
tion of business activities in Russia continued to take concrete shape in the Volkswagen Group."
"In this context, 
further sales negotiations with a number of investors continued or were concluded."
"On registration of the transaction on May 22, 2023, owner-
ship of the shares in Volkswagen Group Rus was transferred from the seller to the buyer."
"In this context, the Volkswagen Group had already made significant impairments in fiscal year 2022 and rec-
ognized appropriate provisions."
The selling price amounted to €0.1 billion.
"The deconsolidation of the affected 
companies resulted in a loss of €0.4 billion in fiscal year 2023, which is reported in the other operating result."
This result is split between the Automotive Division (€– 0.4 billion) and the Financial Services Division (€0.1 billion).
"The loss is mainly attributable to the realization of currency translation effects of €– 0.3 billion, which have been 
reclassified from the currency translation reserve to other operating expenses."
"Apart from winding down Volkswagen Group Rus and its subsidiaries, no additional material expenses were rec-
ognized in connection with the Russia-Ukraine conflict in fiscal year 2023."
"For information on other subsidiaries of the Volkswagen Group being wound down, please refer to the note 
entitled “IFRS 5 – Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale”."
"Please also refer to the comments in the 2023 group management report, specifically in the chapters entitled 
Business Development, Results of Operations, Financial Position and Net Assets, Report on Expected Develop-
ments and Report on Risks and Opportunities."

MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR 
SCOUT MOTORS INC."
"Under the Volkswagen Group’s North America strategy, Scout Motors Inc., Arlington, Virginia/USA, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Volkswagen Finance Luxemburg, Strassen/Luxembourg, was established in fiscal year 2022."
"A new vehicle brand is to be created under the name of Scout to distribute electrified all-terrain vehicles and 
pickups will be distributed in the USA from 2026."
"In order to finance the creation of the Scout brand, as well as 
vehicle development and production planning, an amount of USD 493 million was contributed to the company in 
fiscal year 2023."
"The company has been included in the Volkswagen consolidated financial statements since 
January 1, 2023."
"ARGO AI 
The process of winding down Argo AI, LLC, Pittsburgh/USA (Argo AI) was initiated in the third quarter of 2022."
"In 
this context, Volkswagen contributed USD 60 million to the company in the first half of 2023."
"The contribution 
was written down in full."
"In the previous year, an expense of €1.9 billion had been recognized from the full impair-
ment of the equity investment in Argo AI in the other financial result."
"QUANTUMSCAPE CORPORATION 
In fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the Volkswagen Group acquired new shares in QuantumScape Corporation, San 
José/USA (QuantumScape) through forward purchase agreements resulting from a capital increase."
"Due to Quan-
tumScape’s simultaneous listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the forward purchase agreements had to be 
measured at the respective closing prices."
"As a consequence, a non-cash gain of €1.4 billion was recognized in 
the financial result in fiscal year 2020 and a non-cash expense of €0.6 billion in fiscal year 2021."
"In total, there 
was a non-cash increase of €0.8 billion."
"Due to the share price performance, the Volkswagen Group conducted an impairment test on the shares in 
QuantumScape."
The carrying amount was adjusted on the basis of the impairment test.
"This adjustment led to a 
non-cash expense of €0.3 billion in the second quarter of 2023."
"An additional adjustment of €0.1 billion was iden-
tified in the third quarter of 2023."
"In total, a non-cash expense of €0.4 billion was recognized in fiscal year 2023; 
it is presented in the other financial result."
"On December 6, 2023, Volkswagen acquired 4.99% of the ordinary shares of the electric vehicle company 
XPeng Inc., Cayman Islands (XPeng), at a purchase price totaling USD 706 million."
"Along with the agreement to acquire the shares, a technological 
framework agreement was signed with Guangdong Xiaopeng Motors Technology Co."
"Ltd., Guangzhou/China, a 
subsidiary of XPeng, for the joint development of electric vehicles in China, among other things."
The investment in XPeng is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.

AUDI FAW NEV CO."
"With 
equity interests unchanged, the amendments led to a loss of control over the company by the Volkswagen Group 
and resulted in its deconsolidation."
"The company has since October 1, 2023 been jointly controlled within the 
meaning of IFRS 11."
The investment in Audi FAW NEV Co.
"will consequently be included in the consolidated  
financial statements as a joint venture using the equity method."
"As a result of the change to the way the invest-
ment is accounted for, the cash and cash equivalents previously reported declined by a low three-digit million-
Euro amount."
"Other than that, there were no material effects on the Volkswagen Group’s net assets, financial 
position and results of operations."
"Both investments are classified as debt instruments in the financial statements and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"The measurement resulted in non-cash gains of €0.7 million in fiscal 
year 2023, which are recognized in the other financial result under gains and losses from marketable securities 
and loans."

MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR 
IPO OF PORSCHE AG 
On September 28, 2022, as part of the IPO of Dr. Ing."
"Porsche AG, Stuttgart (Porsche AG), a total of 25% of 
the preferred shares of Porsche AG (including additional allocations) in an amount of around €9.4 billion were 
successfully placed with investors."
"The non-voting preferred shares of Porsche AG have been traded on the  
Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since September 29, 2022."
"Since the end of the stabilization 
period on October 11, 2022, the free float of the preferred shares has been 24.2% of the preferred share capital 
of Porsche AG."
"In connection with the IPO, Volkswagen additionally sold an interest of 25% of Porsche AG’s ordinary shares 
plus one ordinary share to Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Stuttgart (Porsche SE) at a purchase price of around 
€10.1 billion."
The purchase of the ordinary shares was completed in two tranches.
"The cash inflow for the preferred shares and the first tranche of the ordinary shares occurred at the beginning 
of the fourth quarter of 2022."
"The resolution of the extraordinary General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on December 16, 2022 gave rise to the 
obligation to pay a special dividend and led to a total obligation to the shareholders of Volkswagen AG amounting 
to €9.6 billion."
"The cash outflow was slated for January 9, 2023 and occurred on that day."
"Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE agreed to offset the obligation to pay a special dividend to Porsche SE against 
Volkswagen AG’s claim to the payment of the purchase price still outstanding for the second tranche of ordinary 
shares."
"In the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, the purchase price receivable of 
€3.0 billion for the second tranche and the dividend liability of €3.1 billion were therefore presented on a net basis."
"Upon payment of the special dividend on January 9, 2023, the netting process was completed."
"The employees of Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH and Porsche AG participated in the economic 
success of the placement of the preferred shares and the sale of ordinary shares in Porsche AG by way of a one-

"The European Commission issued 
final antitrust approval at the end of May 2022."
"During the extended offer period, the French Financial Markets 
Authority gave Europcar shareholders the opportunity to tender their shares to the consortium company."
"In total, 
93.6% of Europcar’s shareholders accepted the offer."
"The consortium jointly assumed control of Europcar in mid-
June 2022."
"Because the acceptance rate was over 90%, a squeeze-out was initiated for the remaining Europcar 
shares in July 2022, and the company was delisted."
"Since July 13, 2022, the consortium company has held 100% 
of the shares in Europcar."
The purchase price was 51 cents per Europcar share.
"At the end of June 2022, the entire portion of the purchase price attributable to Volkswagen, amounting to 
€1.7 billion, was contributed to GMH."
"Since joint control has been contractually agreed, the company, in which 
Volkswagen holds 66% of the shares, will be accounted for using the equity method in the Volkswagen consoli-
dated financial statements."
"In addition, Volkswagen is the writer of put options held by the other members of the 
consortium, and the other members have granted Volkswagen call options on their shares in the consortium com-
pany."

Effects of climate change 
Against the backdrop of climate change and the resulting stricter emissions regulations, the transformation of the 
automotive industry towards e-mobility and further digitalization continues to make progress."
"In its NEW AUTO 
strategy, the Volkswagen Group has again stepped up the pace of its transformation towards e-mobility."
"In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Management took into account the 
potential effects of climate changes and future regulatory requirements, and especially the corresponding trans-
formation towards e-mobility."
"Potential effects, especially on noncurrent assets, provisions for emissions levies 
and future cash flows were, as far as possible, incorporated as part of the significant estimates and assumptions 
included in the consolidated financial statements."
"The Volkswagen Group aims to increase the share of all-electric 
vehicles as a proportion of total deliveries from 8.3% in 2023 to more than 50% in 2030."
The Group aims to offer its customers worldwide around 50 completely battery-electric models by 2030.
"An amount in the low triple-digit billion euro range has been earmarked for this purpose in the 
medium-term planning."
"In addition, Volkswagen regularly assesses whether these developments give rise to the 
need for ad hoc impairment tests or for adjustments to the useful lives of other noncurrent non-financial assets."
"With reference to increas-
ingly stringent emissions regulations, it is ensured that the various international regulations are taken into account 
and that any obligations are recognized appropriately."
"This did not result in any material effects on the consoli-
dated financial statements."
"The increase in development costs in the areas of e-mobility and digitalization have, 
however, led to a corresponding increase in internally generated intangible assets."

"Once the resolution had been 
passed by the competent bodies, the implementation of a disposal plan was started and expected to be com-
pleted in 2023."
"However, it could not be finalized as an approval by the Russian authorities was still outstanding 
as of December 31, 2023."
"It is expected that the outstanding approval will ultimately be granted and the disposal

Currency translation 
As standard, the Volkswagen Group uses the exchange rates of an external market data provider for translation."
"All exchange rates are based on the respective euro translation rates, from which all non-euro rate combinations 
are derived."
The methods used to measure the individual items are explained in more detail below.
"INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets are accounted for under the cost model."
"Purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost and – if they have finite useful lives – amortized over their 
useful lives using the straight-line method."
"This relates in particular to software, which is normally amortized over 
three years, or licenses, which are normally amortized over the term of the license."
"Development costs for future series products and other internally generated intangible assets are capitalized, 
provided the cash-generating unit to which the respective intangible asset is attributable is not impaired and the 
other criteria for recognition as assets are met."
The costs are amortized using the straight-line method from the start of use (e.g.
"start of production) over the 
expected life cycle of the models, powertrains or software developed – generally between three and nine years."
"Amortization charges on intangible assets are allocated to the relevant functional areas in the income state-
ment."
Brand names from business combinations usually have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not amortized.
An indefinite useful life is usually the result of a brand’s further use and maintenance.
"Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets that are not yet available for use 
are tested for impairment at least once a year."
"Assets in use and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are 
tested for impairment only if there are specific indications that they may be impaired."
"To determine the recoverable 
amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite and finite useful lives, the respective brand is normally 
the cash-generating unit that is used as the testing level."
"Measurement of value in use is based on management’s 
current medium-term planning (referred to as budget planning round)."
"The planning period generally covers five 
years."
"The planning for the Financial Ser-
vices segment is likewise prepared on the basis of these expectations, and also reflects the relevant market pen-
etration rates of expected vehicle sales with finance or lease agreements and other services, as well as regulatory 
requirements."
"The planning for the Power Engineering segment reflects expectations about trends in the various 
individual markets."
"The planning includes reasonable assumptions about macroeconomic trends (exchange rate, 
interest rate and commodity price trends) and historical developments."
"The Volkswagen Group’s planning is based on the assumption that global economic output will grow overall in 
2024 albeit at a slower pace."
"The persistently high inflation in many regions and the resulting restrictive monetary 
policy measures taken by central banks are expected to have an increasingly adverse effect on consumer spending."
"Risks will continue to arise from protectionist tendencies, turbulence in the financial markets and structural defi-
cits in individual countries."
"In addition, continuing geopolitical tensions and conflicts are weighing on growth pro-
spects; risks are associated in particular with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle 
East."
"It is, however, assumed that both the advanced economies and the emerging markets will show positive 
momentum on average, even with below-average growth in gross domestic product."
"Moreover, the global econ-
omy is expected to recover in 2025 and continue a path of stable growth until 2028."

The Volkswagen Group’s automotive market and volume planning reflects the above regional differentiation and 
takes account of the impact of regional conflicts."
"The Volkswagen Group aims to increase the share of all-electric 
vehicles as a proportion of total deliveries from 8.3% in 2023 to more than 50% in 2030."
"The negative impact on 
earnings expected to arise from 2024 onward from higher material costs and more stringent emission and fuel 
consumption legislation is to be more than offset by improvements in pricing and the product mix as well as cor-
responding programs to increase efficiency."
"In addition, the planning is based on the assumption that the supply 
situation for intermediates and commodities will improve from fiscal year 2024 onward."
"For information on the assumptions in the detailed planning period, please refer to the notes on management 
estimates and judgment."
"Further details can be found in the Report on Expected Developments, which is part of 
the management report."
The planning assumptions are adapted to reflect the current state of knowledge.
The estimation of cash flows is generally based on the expected growth trends for the markets concerned.
"The 
estimates for the cash flows following the end of the planning period are generally based on a growth rate of up 
to 1% p.a."
"(previous year: up to 1% p.a.) in the Passenger Cars segment, and on a growth rate of up to 1% p.a."
(previous year: up to 1% p.a.) in the Power Engineering and Commercial Vehicles segments.
"Additionally, specific peer group information on beta factors and leverage is taken into account."
"The composition 
of the peer groups used to determine beta factors and leverage is continuously reviewed and adjusted if necessary."
"PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment is accounted for under the cost model."
"Investment grants received are generally 
deducted from cost."
"Special operational equipment is reported under other equipment, operating and office 
equipment."
"Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful 
life."
"The cost of capital for product-specific tools and other investments is the same as the cost of capital for intangible 
assets given above for each segment."
"LEASES 
The right-of-use assets for leases are reported in the balance sheet under those items in which the assets under-
lying the lease would have been recognized if the Volkswagen Group had been their beneficial owner."
"For this 
reason, the right-of-use assets are presented under noncurrent assets, mostly in property, plant and equipment, 
as of the balance sheet date."
"Practical expedients are allowed for short-term and low-value leases; the Volkswagen Group makes use of this 
option and therefore does not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for these types of leases."
"In this respect, 
the lease payments are recognized as expenses in the income statement."
"Leases are accounted for being as of low 
value if the value of the leased asset when new is no higher than €5,000."
"Furthermore, the accounting rules of 
IFRS 16 are not applied to leases of intangible assets."
A large number of leases contain extension and termination options.
"LEASE ASSETS 
Vehicles leased out under operating leases are recognized at cost and depreciated to their estimated residual 
value using the straight-line method over the term of the lease."
"The forecast residual values are adjusted to  
include constantly updated internal and external information on residual values, depending on specific local fac-
tors and experience in the marketing of used cars."
"This requires management to make assumptions in particular 
about vehicle supply and demand in the future, as well as about vehicle price trends."
"Such assumptions are based 
either on qualified estimates or on data published by external experts."
"Qualified estimates are based on external 
data – if available – that reflects additional information that is available from within the company, such as histor-
ical experience and current sales data."
"The fair value of investment property is dis-
closed in the notes."
Fair value is generally estimated using an investment method based on internal calculations.
"This involves determining the income value for a specific building on the basis of gross income, taking into  
account additional factors such as land value, remaining useful life and a multiplier specific to property."

CAPITALIZATION OF BORROWING COSTS 
Borrowing costs of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the cost of these assets."
"A qualifying asset is an 
asset that necessarily takes at least a year to get ready for its intended use."
"EQUITY-ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 
The cost of shares in associates and joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method."
"Testing the net 
investment for impairment, the recoverable amount is determined using the principles described for indefinite-
lived intangible assets."
"FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Regular way purchases or sales of financial instruments are accounted for at the settlement date – that is, at the 
date on which the asset is delivered."
"In the Volkswagen Group, financial assets and liabilities are allocated to the “at amortized cost” and “at fair 
value” categories."
"FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT AMORTIZED COST 
Financial assets measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method relate to 
 receivables from financing business; 
 trade receivables; 
 other receivables and financial assets; 
 time deposits; 
 cash and cash equivalents."
"In contrast, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method consist of  
 trade payables; 
 other financial liabilities; 
 liabilities to banks;  
 commercial paper and notes;  
 loans."
"For reasons of materiality, discounting or unwinding of discounting is not applied to current receivables and lia-
bilities (due within one year)."
"Certain changes in the fair value of these debt  
instruments (impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, interest calculated using the effective inter-
est method) are recognized immediately in profit or loss."
"Secondly, those equity instruments not held for trading (“hold” business model) are measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income."
"Here, Volkswagen exercises the option to recognize changes in fair value 
always through other comprehensive income."
"302 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
At Volkswagen, the category of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss primarily comprises 
 hedging relationships to which hedge accounting is not applied and 
 investment fund units."
"All financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss relate to derivatives not designated as hedging instru-
ments in hedge accounting."
Fair value generally corresponds to the market or quoted market price.
"If no active market exists, fair value is 
determined using other observable inputs as far as possible."
"In the case of current financial receivables and liabilities, amortized cost generally corresponds to the principal 
or repayment amount."
The fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities is not used in the Volkswagen Group.
"Shares in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that are neither consolidated for reasons of materiality nor 
accounted for using the equity method do not fall within the scope of IFRS 9 and IFRS 7."
"DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
Volkswagen Group companies use derivatives to hedge balance sheet items and future cash flows (hedged items)."
"Appropriate derivatives such as swaps, forward transactions and options are used as hedging instruments."
"The accounting treatment of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments depends on the nature of the 
hedging relationship."
"In the case of hedges against the risk of change in the fair value of balance sheet items (fair 
value hedges), both the hedging instrument and the hedged risk portion of the hedged item are measured at fair 
value."
"If appropriate, several risk portions of the hedged items are combined into one portfolio."
"In a portfolio fair 
value hedge, changes in fair values are recognized on the basis of the individual transaction in the same way as in 
fair value hedging."
"Gains or losses from the measurement of hedging instruments and hedged items are recog-
nized in profit or loss."
"In addition to the guidance of IFRS 9, the Volkswagen Group applies the guidance of IAS 39 
on portfolio hedging to hedge the interest rate risk in the Financial Services Division."
"In the case of hedges of future cash flows (cash flow hedges), the hedging instruments are also measured at fair 
value."
"The designated effective portion of the hedging instrument is accounted for through OCI I and the non-
designated portion through OCI II."
"They are only recognized in the income statement or reclassified to inventories 
when the hedged item is realized."
"The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recognized through profit or loss 
immediately."
This also applies to options on shares.
"External 
hedging instruments of intragroup hedged items that are subsequently eliminated in the consolidated financial 
statements are also assigned to this category as a general rule."
"Assets and liabilities measured at fair value through 
profit or loss consist of derivatives or components of derivatives that are not included in hedge accounting."
"These 
relate for example to the non-designated currency forwards used to hedge sales revenue, interest rate hedges, 
commodity forwards and swaps and currency forwards relating to commodity forwards and swaps."

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial assets are exposed to default risk, which is taken into account by recognizing loss allowances or, if 
losses have already been incurred, by recognizing impairment losses."
"Default risk on loans and receivables in the 
financial services segment is accounted for by recognizing specific loss allowances and general loss allowances."
"In particular, a loss allowance is recognized on these financial assets in the amount of the expected loss in 
accordance with Group-wide standards."
"The actual specific loss allowances for the losses incurred are then 
charged to this loss allowance."
"Insignificant receivables and significant individual receivables for which there is no indication of impairment 
are grouped into homogeneous portfolios on the basis of comparable credit risk features and allocated by risk 
class."
"Average historical default probabilities in combination with forward-looking parameters for the respective 
portfolio are then used to calculate the amount of the impairment loss."
"Credit risks must be considered for all financial assets measured at amortized cost or fair value through other 
comprehensive income (debt instruments), as well as for contract assets in accordance with IFRS 15 and lease 
receivables within the scope of IFRS 16."
"The rules on impairment also apply to risks from irrevocable credit com-
mitments not recognized in the balance sheet and to the measurement of financial guarantees."
"As a matter of principle, a simplified process, which takes historical default rates and forward-looking infor-
mation into account, and specific loss allowances are used to account for impairment losses on receivables out-
side the Financial Services segment."
"DEFERRED TAXES 
The tax consequences of dividend payments are generally not taken into account until the resolution on appro-
priation of earnings available for distribution has been adopted."
"Deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be realized within a clearly predictable period are reduced by loss  
allowances."
"Deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards are usually measured on the basis of future taxable income over 
a planning period of five fiscal years."
"INVENTORIES 
Raw materials, consumables and supplies, merchandise, work in progress and self-produced finished goods re-
ported in inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value."
Borrowing costs are not capitalized.
The measurement of same or similar inventories is generally based on the weighted average method.
"SHARE-BASED PAYMENT 
Share-based payment in the Volkswagen Group comprises cash-settled performance share plans that are recog-
nized in accordance with IFRS 2."

OTHER PROVISIONS 
Provisions not resulting in an outflow of resources within one year are recognized at their settlement value dis-
counted to the balance sheet date."
Discounting is based on market interest rates.
"An average discount rate of 
2.87% (previous year: 3.16%) was used in the Eurozone."
"The settlement value also reflects cost increases  
expected."
"OTHER LIABILITIES (NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF A SPECIFIC IFRS) 
Other noncurrent liabilities outside the scope of a specific IFRS are carried at amortized cost in the balance sheet."
Differences between historical cost and the repayment amount are amortized using the effective interest method.
"Other current liabilities outside the scope of a specific IFRS are recognized at their repayment or settlement 
amount."
"REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION 
Sales revenue, interest and commission income from financial services and other operating income are recognized 
only when the relevant services have been rendered or the goods have been delivered, i.e."
"when the customer has 
obtained control of the goods or services."
"Where new and used vehicles and original parts are sold, the Company’s 
performance generally occurs upon delivery, because that is the point when control is transferred, and the inven-
tory risk and, for deliveries to a dealer, generally also the pricing decision pass to the customer."
"Revenue is  
reported net of sales allowances (discounts, customer bonuses, or rebates)."
"The Volkswagen Group measures 
sales allowances and other variable consideration on the basis of experience and by taking account of current 
circumstances."
Vehicles are normally sold to dealers on payment terms.
"A trade receivable is recognized for the 
period between vehicle delivery and receipt of payment."
"Any financing component included in the transaction is 
only recognized if the period between the transfer of the goods and the payment of consideration is longer than 
one year and the amount to be accrued is significant."
Income from financing and finance lease agreements is recognized using the effective interest method.
"If non-
interest-bearing or low-interest vehicle financing arrangements are agreed, sales revenue for the vehicles is  
reduced by the interest benefits granted."
"Sales revenue from operate leases is recognized over the term of the 
contract on a straight line basis."
"As a rule, the stage of completion is determined 
as the proportion that contract costs incurred by the end of the reporting period bear to the estimated total con-
tract costs (cost-to-cost method)."
"Contract costs incurred generally represent the best way to measure the stage 
of completion for the performance obligation."
"If the outcome of a performance obligation satisfied over time is not 
sufficiently certain, but the Company expects, as a minimum, to recover its costs, revenue is only recognized in the 
amount of contract costs incurred (zero profit margin method)."
"Since long-term construction contracts invariably 
give rise to contingent receivables from customers for the period to completion or payment by the customer, con-
tract assets are recognized for the corresponding amounts."
"A trade receivable is recognized as soon as the Com-
pany has transferred the goods or services in full."
"If services are sold to the customer at the same time as the vehicle, and the customer pays for them in advance, 
the Group recognizes a corresponding contract liability until the services have been transferred."
"Examples of ser-
vices that customers pay for in advance are servicing, maintenance and certain warranty contracts as well as  
mobile online services."
"For extended warranties granted to all customers for a particular model, a provision is nor-
mally recognized in the same way as for statutory warranties."
"If the warranty is optional for the customer or  
includes an additional service component, the related sales revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of 
the warranty."
"305 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
Income from the sale of assets for which a Group company has a buyback obligation is recognized only when the 
assets have definitively left the Group."
"If a fixed repurchase price was agreed when the contract was entered into, 
the difference between the selling price and the present value of the repurchase price is recognized ratably as 
income over the term of the contract."
"Prior to that time, the assets are carried as inventories in the case of short 
contract terms and as lease assets in the case of long contract terms."
Sales revenue is generally determined on the basis of the price stated in the contract.
"If variable consideration 
(e.g."
"volume-based bonus payments) has been agreed in a contract, the large number of contracts involved means 
that revenue has to be estimated using the expected value method."
"In exceptional cases, the most probable 
amount method may also be used."
"Once the expected sales revenue has been estimated, an additional check is 
carried out to determine whether there is any uncertainty that necessitates the reversal of the revenue initially 
recognized so that it can be virtually ruled out that sales revenue subsequently has to be adjusted downward."
Provisions for reimbursements arise mainly from dealer bonuses.
"In multiple element arrangements, the transaction price is allocated to the different performance obligations 
of the contract on the basis of relative standalone selling prices."
"In the Automotive Division, non-vehicle-related 
services are generally measured at their standalone selling prices for reasons of materiality."
"Cost of sales includes the costs incurred to generate the sales revenue and the cost of goods purchased for 
resale."
This item also includes the costs of additions to warranty provisions.
"Research and development costs not 
eligible for capitalization in the period and amortization of development costs are likewise carried under cost of 
sales."
"Reflecting the presentation of interest and commission income in sales revenue, the interest and commis-
sion expenses attributable to the financial services business are presented in cost of sales."
"GOVERNMENT GRANTS 
Government grants related to assets are deducted when arriving at the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognized in profit or loss over the life of the depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense."
"Government grants related to income, i.e."
"that compensate the Group for expenses incurred, are generally rec-
ognized in profit or loss for the period and allocated to those items in which the expenses to be compensated by 
the grants are also recognized."
Grants in the form of nonmonetary assets (e.g.
"the use of land free of charge or the 
transfer of resources free of charge) are disclosed as a memo item."
"The estimates made in order to separate cash flows mainly relate to future market shares, the 
trend in the respective markets and the profitability of the Volkswagen Group’s products."
"When determining cash 
flows for conducting impairment tests on companies or equity investments with new technology operations, it is 
of particular importance to assess whether these new technologies are technically feasible and have the potential 
for industrial use."
"The recoverability of the Group’s lease assets depends in particular on the residual value of the 
leased vehicles after expiration of the lease term, because this represents a significant portion of the expected 
cash flows."
"More detailed information on impairment tests and the measurement parameters used for those tests 
can be found in the explanations above regarding intangible assets."
"If there are no observable market inputs, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured using recognized valuation techniques, such as the relief-from-royalty method or the 
residual method."
"Impairment testing of financial assets requires estimates about the extent and probability of occurrence of 
future events."
"As far as possible, estimates are derived from experience taking into account current market data 
as well as rating categories and scoring information."
"The sections entitled “IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments)” and 
“Financial risk management and financial instruments” contain further details on how to determine loss allow-
ances."
"Accounting for provisions is also based on estimates of the extent and probability of occurrence of future 
events, as well as estimates of the discount rate."
"As far as possible, these are also based on experience or external 
opinions."
"The assumptions applied in the measurement of pension provisions are described in the “Provisions for 
pensions and other post-employment benefits” section."
"Actuarial gains or losses arising from changes in meas-
urement inputs are recognized in other comprehensive income and therefore do not affect profit or loss reported 
in the income statement."
"Any change in the estimates of the amount of other provisions is always recognized in 
profit or loss."
The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information obtained.
"The use of expected values 
invariably means that unused provisions are reversed or additional amounts have to be recognized for provisions."
"Similarly to expenses for the recognition of provisions, income from the reversal of provisions is allocated to the 
respective functions."
"Warranty claims from sales transactions are calculated on the basis of losses to date, esti-
mated future losses and the policy on ex gratia arrangements."
"In addition, assumptions must be made about the 
nature and extent of future warranty and ex gratia claims."
"For the provisions recognized in connection with the diesel issue, assumptions were made in particular for 
working hours, material costs and hourly wage rates, depending on the series, model year and country concerned."
"In addition, assumptions were made for future resale prices of repurchased vehicles."
"These assumptions are based 
on qualified estimates, which are based, in turn, upon external data, and also reflect additional information avail-
able internally, such as values derived from past experience."
"Further information on the legal proceedings and on 
the legal risks associated with the diesel issue can be found in the “Litigation” section."
"307

Tax provisions were recognized for potential future retrospective tax payments, while other provisions were rec-
ognized for ancillary tax payments arising in this connection."
"Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries have operations worldwide and are audited by local tax authorities on an 
ongoing basis."
"Amendments to tax laws and changes in legal precedent and their interpretation by the tax  
authorities in the respective countries may lead to tax payments that differ from the estimates made in the finan-
cial statements."
The measurement of the tax provision is based on the most likely exposure resulting from this risk materializing.
"Volkswagen decides whether to account for multiple tax uncertainties separately or in groups on the merits of 
each individual case considered, depending on which type of presentation is better suited to predicting the extent 
to which the tax risk will materialize."
"In these cases, prices – including for tax purposes – are 
determined on the basis of standardized, generally accepted valuation techniques."
"If actual developments differ from the assumptions made for recognizing the provisions, the figures actually 
recorded may differ compared to the estimates expected originally."
An overview of other provisions can be found in the “Noncurrent and current other provisions” section.
"Government grants are recognized based on an assessment as to whether there is reasonable assurance that 
the Group companies will fulfill the conditions for awarding the grants and that the grants will in fact be awarded."
This assessment is based on the nature of the legal entitlement and past experience.
Estimates of the useful life of finite-lived assets are based on experience and are reviewed regularly.
"Where 
estimates are modified the residual useful life is adjusted and an impairment loss is recognized, if necessary."
"As 
part of this review, the useful lives of certain items of property, plant and equipment were reassessed and extended 
in January 2023."
"These adjustments had a positive effect on the operating result in an amount of around €1.4 bil-
lion in 2023."
A positive effect of around €0.8 billion is expected in 2024.
"Estimates of lease terms under IFRS 16 are based on the non-cancelable period of a lease and an assessment 
of whether existing extension and termination options will be exercised."
"The determination of the lease term and 
the discount rates used impacts on the amounts to be recognized for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities."
"Measuring deferred tax assets requires assumptions regarding future taxable income and the timing of the 
realization of deferred tax assets."
"The estimates and assumptions are based on underlying assumptions that reflect the current state of available 
knowledge."
"Specifically, the expected future development of business was based on the circumstances known at 
the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements and a realistic assessment of the future devel-
opment of the global and sector-specific environment."
"Estimates and assumptions remain subject to a high degree 
of uncertainty because future business developments are subject to uncertainties that in part cannot be influenced 
by the Group."
"This applies in particular to short- and medium-term cash flow forecasts and to the discount rates 
used."
"Developments in this environment that differ from the assumptions and that cannot be influenced by manage-
ment could result in amounts that differ from the original estimates."
"If actual developments differ from the  
expected developments, the underlying assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of the assets and 
liabilities affected are adjusted."
"The slowdown in economic momentum compared with the previous year was mainly due to weaker growth in the 
advanced economies, whereas the overall rate of change in the emerging markets increased somewhat."
"308 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
The Volkswagen Group’s planning is based on the assumption that global economic output will grow overall in 
2024 albeit at a slower pace."
"The persistently high inflation in many regions and the resulting restrictive monetary 
policy measures taken by central banks are expected to have an increasingly adverse effect on consumer spend-
ing."
"Risks will continue to arise from protectionist tendencies, turbulence in the financial markets and structural 
deficits in individual countries."
"In addition, continuing geopolitical tensions and conflicts are weighing on growth 
prospects; risks are associated in particular with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle 
East."
"It is, however, assumed that both the advanced economies and the emerging markets will show positive 
momentum on average, even with below-average growth in gross domestic product."
"Moreover, the global econ-
omy is expected to recover in 2025 and continue a path of stable growth until 2028."
"Estimates and assumptions by management were based in particular on assumptions relating to the develop-
ment of the general economic environment, the automotive markets and the legal environment."
"These and further 
assumptions are explained in detail in the Report on Expected Developments, which is part of the group manage-
ment report."

Segment reporting 
Segments are identified on the basis of the Volkswagen Group’s internal management and reporting."
"In line with 
the Group’s multibrand strategy, each of its brands (operating segments) is managed by its own Board of Man-
agement."
"The Group targets and requirements laid down by the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG must 
be complied with."
"Segment reporting comprises four reportable segments: Passenger Cars and Light Commercial 
Vehicles, Commercial Vehicles, Power Engineering and Financial Services."
"The activities of the Passenger Cars and Light Commercial Vehicles segment cover the development of vehi-
cles, engines and vehicle software, the production and sale of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, and 
the corresponding genuine parts business."
"In the Passenger Cars and Light Commercial Vehicles reporting seg-
ment, the individual brands are combined into a single reportable segment, in particular as a response to the high 
degree of technological and economic interlinking in the production network."
"Furthermore, there is collaboration 
within key areas such as procurement, research and development or treasury."
"The Commercial Vehicles segment primarily comprises the development, production and sale of trucks and 
buses, the corresponding genuine parts business and related services."
"As in the case of the passenger car brands, 
there is collaboration within the areas procurement, development and sales."
"The aim is to create closer coopera-
tion within the business areas."
"The Power Engineering segment combines the large-bore diesel engines, turbomachinery and propulsion com-
ponents businesses."
"The activities of the Financial Services segment comprise dealership and customer financing, leasing, direct 
banking and insurance activities, fleet management and mobility services."
"In this segment, activities are combined 
for reporting purposes taking into particular account the comparability of the type of services and of the regulatory 
environment."
Purchase price allocation for companies acquired is allocated directly to the corresponding segments.
"At Volkswagen, segment profit or loss is measured on the basis of the operating result."
"In segment reporting, the share of the result of joint ventures is contained in the result of equity-accounted 
investments in the corresponding segments."
The reconciliation contains activities and other operations that by definition do not constitute segments.
"It also 
includes the unallocated Group financing activities."
"Consolidation adjustments between the segments are also 
contained in the reconciliation."
"Investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property are reported net of 
investments in right-of-use assets from leases."
"As a matter of principle, business relationships between the companies within the segments of the Volkswagen 
Group are transacted at arm’s length prices."
2 Prior-year figures adjusted (see disclosures on IFRS 17 in the “Effects of new and amended IFRSs” section).
Allocation of sales revenue to the regions follows the destination principle.
"The allocation of interregional intragroup transactions regarding the segment assets has been presented uni-
formly according to the economic ownership."

For segment reporting purposes, the sales revenue of the Group is presented by segment and market."
"Other sales revenue comprises revenue from workshop services and extended warranties, among other things."
"Of the sales revenue recognized in the period under review, an amount of €8,936 million (previous year: 
€8,045 million) was included in contract liabilities as of January 1, 2023."
"The sales revenue realized in the period under review comprises performance obligations of €363 million (pre-
vious year: €718 million) that had already been met in an earlier period."
"Most of these deliveries had already been made at 
the time this report was prepared, or will be made in the first quarter of 2024."
"In the case of variable consideration, sales revenue is only 
recognized to the extent that there is reasonable assurance that this sales revenue will not subsequently have to 
be reversed or adjusted downward."
"Cost of sales 
Cost of sales includes interest expenses of €7,968 million (previous year: €3,323 million) attributable to the  
financial services business."
"This item also includes impairment losses on intangible assets (primarily development costs), property, plant 
and equipment (primarily other equipment, operating and office equipment), and lease assets in the amount of 
€1,335 million (previous year: €843 million)."
"The impairment 
losses on lease assets in the amount of €947 million (previous year: €270 million) are predominantly attributable 
to the Financial Services segment."
"They are based on constantly updated internal and external information that is 
factored into the forecast residual values of the vehicles."
"€138 million (previous year: €10 million) of this figure is 
reported in current lease assets."
"Government grants related to income amounted to €292 million in the fiscal year (previous year: €457 million) 
and were generally allocated to the functional areas."
"Distribution expenses 
Distribution expenses amounting to €21.3 billion (previous year: €19.8 billion) include nonstaff overheads and 
personnel costs, and depreciation and amortization applicable to the distribution function, as well as the costs of 
shipping, advertising and sales promotions."

In accordance with IAS 12.39, deferred tax liabilities of €251 million (previous year: €265 million) for temporary 
differences and undistributed profits of Volkswagen AG subsidiaries were not recognized because control exists."
"Deferred tax income resulting from changes in tax rates amounted to €9 million at Group level (previous year: 
deferred tax expense of €31 million)."
"Deferred tax assets of €6,508 million (previous year: €1,731 million) were recognized without being offset by 
deferred tax liabilities in the same amount."
"In fiscal year 2023, the existing deferred tax assets of companies within

or the previous year."
"€2,861 million (previous year adjusted: €2,407 million (see changes in comprehensive income)) of the deferred 
taxes recognized in the balance sheet was credited to equity and relates to other comprehensive income."
€– 66 million (previous year: €– 6 million) of this figure is attributable to noncontrolling interests.
"In fiscal year 
2023, no deferred tax income from the remeasurement of pension plans directly through equity was reclassified 
within equity (previous year: €2 million)."
"In the previous year, there were effects from capital transactions with 
noncontrolling interests."

Volkswagen Group falls within the scope of the OECD model regulations of Pillar Two.
"Since the Pillar Two legislation had not yet been finalized at the time of 
the report, Volkswagen Group is not subject to any tax burden in this regard for the financial year 2023."
"The exception introduced in May 2023 with the amendments to IAS 12 means that deferred taxes in connection 
with income taxes resulting from applicable or announced tax provisions implementing the Pillar Two model rules 
published by the OECD are neither recognized nor disclosed at Volkswagen Group."
"According to legislation, Volkswagen Group will be liable for an additional tax per country at the difference 
between the GloBE effective tax rate and the minimum tax rate of 15%."
"Volkswagen Group is currently in the process of assessing the impact of Pillar Two legislation becoming effec-
tive as of in 2024 et seq."
"Although the average effective tax rate is less than 15% based on the CbCR data, Volkswagen

Group may not be required to pay Pillar Two income taxes in respect of these countries."
"This is due to specific 
adjustments provided for in the Pillar Two legislation, which may result in deviations from the effective tax rates 
calculated."
"Overall, it is assumed that the tax burden for Volkswagen Group from Pillar Two based on the 2021 and 
2022 CbCR data will amount to a range of between EUR 10 million to 20 EUR million."
"This would have an effect 
of 0.04% - 0.08% on the Group tax rate."
"Hence, there are no material effects on the net assets, financial position 
and earnings of Volkswagen Group."
"Due to the complexity of the application of the legislation, the quantitative effects of the legislation enacted or 
entered into force can currently only be estimated in ranges."
"Therefore, even for group companies with an effective 
tax rate of more than 15%, Pillar Two may have tax implications."
"Furthermore, on the basis of the CbCR Safe Har-
bour, this assessment only applies on a transitional basis (currently until the end of the financial year 2026)."
"For 
the years following the expiry of the CbCR Safe Harbours, further analyses will be carried out on the basis of the 
general set of rules."

"Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings attributable to Volkswagen AG shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary and preferred shares outstanding during the reporting period."
"Since there

"Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits 
Provisions for pensions are recognized for commitments in the form of retirement, invalidity and dependents’ 
benefits payable under pension plans."
"The benefits provided by the Group vary according to the legal, tax and 
economic circumstances of the country concerned, and usually depend on the length of service and remuneration 
of the employees."
"Volkswagen Group companies provide occupational pensions under both defined contribution and defined 
benefit plans."
"In the case of defined contribution plans, the Company makes contributions to state or private pen-
sion schemes based on legal or contractual requirements, or on a voluntary basis."
"Once the contributions have 
been paid, there are no further obligations for the Volkswagen Group."
"Current contributions are recognized as 
pension expenses of the period concerned."
"In fiscal year 2023, they amounted to a total of €3,061 million (previous 
year: €2,846 million) in the Volkswagen Group."
"Of this figure, contributions to the compulsory state pension sys-
tem in Germany amounted to €1,963 million (previous year: €1,854 million)."
"In the case of defined benefit plans, a distinction is made between pensions funded by provisions and exter-
nally funded plans."
"Measurement reflects 
actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, salary and pension trends, employee turnover rates, longevity and  
increases in healthcare costs, which were determined for each Group company depending on the economic envi-
ronment."
"Remeasurements arise from differences between what has actually occurred and the prior-year assump-
tions, from changes in assumptions, as well as from gains or losses on plan assets, excluding amounts included in 
net interest income or expenses."
"They are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, in the 
period in which they arise."
"Multi-employer pension plans exist in the Volkswagen Group in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden and 
the Netherlands."
These plans are defined benefit plans.
"A small proportion of them are accounted for as defined 
contribution plans, as the Volkswagen Group is not authorized to receive the information required in order to  
account for them as defined benefit plans."
"Under the terms of the multi-employer plans, the Volkswagen Group is 
not liable for the obligations of the other employers."
"In the event of its withdrawal from the plans or their winding-
up, the proportionate share of the surplus of assets attributable to the Volkswagen Group will be credited or the 
proportionate share of the deficit attributable to the Volkswagen Group will have to be funded."
"In the case of the 
defined benefit plans accounted for as defined contribution plans, the Volkswagen Group’s share of the obligations 
represents a small proportion of the total obligations."
"No probable significant risks arising from multi-employer 
defined benefit pension plans that are accounted for as defined contribution plans have been identified."
"The  
expected contributions to those plans will amount to €30 million for fiscal year 2024."
"Owing to their benefit character, the obligations of the US Group companies in respect of post-employment 
medical care in particular are also carried under provisions for pensions."
"These post-employment benefit provi-
sions take into account the expected long-term change in the cost of healthcare."
"In fiscal year 2023, €40 million 
(previous year: €33 million) was recognized as an expense for healthcare costs."
"The related carrying amount as of 
December 31, 2023 was €550 million (previous year: €637 million)."
"340 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
The following amounts were recognized in the balance sheet for defined benefit plans: 
 
 
  
  
€ million 
 
Dec."
"Most of the arrangements in the Volkswagen Group are pension 
plans for employees in Germany classified as defined benefit plans under IAS 19."
"The majority of these obligations 
are funded solely by recognized provisions."
These plans are now largely closed to new members.
"To reduce the 
risks associated with defined benefit plans, in particular longevity, salary increases and inflation, the Volkswagen 
Group has introduced new defined benefit plans in recent years whose benefits are funded by appropriate external 
plan assets."
The aforementioned risks have been largely reduced in these pension plans.
"The proportion of the 
total defined benefit obligation attributable to pension obligations funded by plan assets will continue to rise in 
the future."
The significant pension plans are described in the following.
"GERMAN PENSION PLANS FUNDED SOLELY BY RECOGNIZED PROVISIONS 
The pension plans funded solely by recognized provisions comprise both contribution-based plans with guaran-
tees and final salary plans."
"For contribution-based plans, an annual pension expense dependent on income and 
status is converted into a lifelong pension entitlement using annuity factors (guaranteed modular pension entitle-
ments)."
The annuity factors include a guaranteed rate of interest.
"At retirement, the modular pension entitlements 
earned annually are added together."
"For final salary plans, the underlying salary is multiplied at retirement by a 
percentage that depends on the years of service up until the retirement date."
"The present value of the guaranteed obligation rises as interest rates fall and is therefore exposed to interest 
rate risk."
The pension system provides for lifelong pension payments.
"The companies bear the longevity risk in this re-
spect."
"This is accounted for by calculating the annuity factors and the present value of the guaranteed obli-
gation using the latest generational mortality tables – the “Heubeck 2018 G” mortality tables – which already 
reflect future increases in life expectancy."
"To reduce the inflation risk from adjusting the regular pension payments by the rate of inflation, a pension 
adjustment that is not indexed to inflation was introduced for pension plans where this is permitted by law."

GERMAN PENSION PLANS FUNDED BY EXTERNAL PLAN ASSETS 
The pension plans funded by external plan assets are contribution-based plans with guarantees."
"In this case, an 
annual pension expense dependent on income and status is either converted into a lifelong pension entitlement 
using annuity factors (guaranteed modular pension entitlement) or paid out in a single lump sum or in installments."
"In some cases, employees also have the opportunity to provide for their own retirement through deferred compensa-
tion."
The annuity factors include a guaranteed rate of interest.
"At retirement, the modular pension entitlements 
earned annually are added together."
"The pension expense is contributed on an ongoing basis to a separate pool 
of assets that is administered independently of the Company in trust and invested in the capital markets."
"If the 
plan assets exceed the present value of the obligations calculated using the guaranteed rate of interest, surpluses 
are allocated (modular pension bonuses)."
"Since the assets administered in trust meet the IAS 19 criteria for classification as plan assets, they are  
deducted from the obligations."
The amount of the pension assets is exposed to general market risk.
"The investment strategy and its imple-
mentation are therefore continuously monitored by the trusts’ governing bodies, on which the companies are also rep-
resented."
"For example, investment policies are stipulated in investment guidelines with the aim of limiting market 
risk and its impact on plan assets."
"In addition, asset-liability management studies are conducted if required 
so as to ensure that investments are in line with the obligations that need to be covered."
"The pension assets are 
currently invested primarily in fixed-income or equity funds."
"The main risks are therefore interest rate and 
equity price risk."
"To mitigate market risk, the pension system also provides for cash funds to be set aside in an 
equalization reserve before any surplus is allocated."
"The present value of the obligation is the present value of the guaranteed obligation after deducting the plan 
assets."
"If the plan assets fall below the present value of the guaranteed obligation, a provision must be recognized 
in that amount."
"The present value of the guaranteed obligation rises as interest rates fall and is therefore exposed 
to interest rate risk."
"In the case of lifelong pension payments, the Volkswagen Group bears the longevity risk."
"This is accounted for 
by calculating the annuity factors and the present value of the guaranteed obligation using the latest generational 
mortality tables – the “Heubeck 2018 G” mortality tables – which already reflect future increases in life expectancy."
"In 
addition, the independent actuaries carry out annual risk monitoring as part of the review of the assets adminis-
tered by the trusts."
"To reduce the inflation risk from adjusting the regular pension payments by the rate of inflation, a pension adjust-
ment that is not indexed to inflation was introduced for pension plans where this is permitted by law."
"With regard to life expectancy, consideration is given to the latest mortality tables in each country."
"The dis-
count rates are generally defined to reflect the yields on prime-rated corporate bonds with matching matur-
ities and currencies."
"The iBoxx AA Corporate Bond index was taken as the basis for the obligations of German 
Group companies."
Similar indices were used for foreign pension obligations.
"The payroll trends cover expected wage and salary trends, which also include increases attributable to career 
development."
"The pension trends either reflect the contractually guaranteed pension adjustments or are based on the rules 
on pension adjustments in force in each country."
The employee turnover rates are based on past experience and future expectations.
"In the previous year, the rise in the discount rate from 1.2% to 3.7% led to actuarial gains of 
€19,588 million, while the increase in the pension trend from 1.7% to 2.2% had an offsetting effect, reducing  
actuarial gains by €2,389 million."
"Changes in the relevant actuarial assumptions would have had the following effects on the defined benefit obli-
gation: 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
DEC."
"any correlation effects between the individual as-
sumptions are ignored."
"To examine the sensitivity of the present value of the defined benefit obligation to a change in assumed longevity, 
the estimates of mortality were reduced as part of a comparative calculation to the extent that doing so increases 
life expectancy by approximately one year."
"The average duration of the defined benefit obligation weighted by the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation (Macaulay duration) is 16 years (previous year: 16 years)."
"Employer contributions to plan assets are expected to amount to €973 million (previous year: €901 million) in the 
next fiscal year."

"2.1 Operating leases 
Assets leased under long-term operating leases amounted to €64,726 million at the end of the fiscal year (previ-

"While €632 million (previous year: €610 million) is attributable to investment property, 
assets separately reported as lease assets in the balance sheet amount to €64,094 million (previous year: 
€59,380 million)."
"They relate primarily to vehicles in an amount of €64,059 million (previous year: €59,263 mil-

"Reconcilitation of balance sheet items to classes of financial instruments 
The following table shows the reconciliation of the balance sheet items to the relevant classes of financial instru-
ments, broken down by the carrying amount and fair value of the financial instruments."
"The fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost, such as receivables and liabilities, is calcu-
lated by discounting the carrying amount using a market rate of interest for a similar risk and matching maturity."
"For reasons of materiality, the fair value of current balance sheet items is generally deemed to be their carrying 
amount."
"For reconciliation to the carrying amounts, the “Not allocated to a measurement category” column in the table 
also includes items other than financial instruments."
The risk variables governing the fair value of the receivables are risk-adjusted interest rates.
“Financial instruments measured at fair value” also include shares in partnerships and corporations.
"The category headed “not allocated to a measurement category” is used in particular for shares in equity- 
accounted investments, shares in non-consolidated affiliated companies as well as for lease receivables."
"The carrying amount of lease receivables was €62.3 billion (previous year: €55.1 billion) and their fair value 
was €62.2 billion (previous year: €54.1 billion)."

"Level 1 is used to report the fair value of financial instruments for which a price is 
directly available in an active market."
"Examples include marketable securities and other equity investments 
measured at fair value that are listed and traded on a public market."
"Fair values in Level 2, for example of deriva-
tives, are measured on the basis of market inputs using market-based valuation techniques."
"In particular, the inputs 
used include exchange rates, yield curves and commodity prices that are observable in the relevant markets and 
obtained through pricing services."
"Fair Values in Level 3 are calculated using valuation techniques that incor-
porate inputs that are not directly observable in active markets."
"In the Volkswagen Group, long-term commodity 
swaps are allocated to Level 3 because the prices available on the market must be extrapolated for measurement 
purposes."
"This is done on the basis of observable inputs obtained for the different commodities through pricing 
services."
"Options on equity instruments, residual value protection models, customer financing receivables and 
receivables from vehicle financing programs and other equity investments are also reported in Level 3."
"Equity 
instruments are measured primarily using the relevant business plans and entity-specific discount rates."
"The sig-
nificant inputs used to measure fair value for the residual value protection models include forecasts and estimates 
of used vehicle residual values for the appropriate models."
"The measurement of vehicle financing programs  
requires in particular the use of the corresponding vehicle price."
"360 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
The transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the respective reporting dates."
"The 
transfers out of Level 3 into Level 2 comprise commodity swaps for which observable quoted prices are now 
available for measurement purposes due to the decline in their remaining maturities; consequently, no further 
extrapolation is required."
Commodity prices are the key risk variable for the fair value of commodity swaps.
"Sensitivity analyses are used 
to present the effect of changes in commodity prices on earnings after tax and equity."
"If commodity prices for commodity swaps classified as Level 3 had been 10% higher (lower) as of December 31, 
2023, earnings after tax would have been €217 million (previous year: €291 million) higher (lower)."
"Beyond that, 
equity would not be materially affected."
"The key risk variable for measuring options on equity instruments held by the Company is the relevant enter-
prise value."
Sensitivity analyses are used to present the effect of changes in risk variables on earnings after tax.
"If the assumed enterprise values at December 31, 2023 had been 10% higher, earnings after tax would have 
been €2 million (previous year: €8 million) higher."
"If the assumed enterprise values as of December 31, 2023 had 
been 10% lower, earnings after tax would have been €2 million (previous year: €8 million) lower."
"Residual value risks result from hedging agreements with dealerships under which earnings effects caused by 
market-related fluctuations in residual values that arise from buy-back obligations under leases are borne in part 
by the Volkswagen Group."
The key risk variable influencing the fair value of the options relating to residual value risks is used car prices.
Sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the effects of changes in used car prices on earnings after tax.
"If the prices of the used cars covered by the residual value protection model had been 10% higher as of Decem-
ber 31, 2023, earnings after tax would have been €491 million (previous year: €470 million) higher."
"If the prices of 
the used cars covered by the residual value protection model had been 10% lower as of December 31, 2023, earn-
ings after tax would have been €522 million (previous year: €504 million) lower."
"If the risk-adjusted interest rates applied to receivables measured at fair value had been 100 basis points higher 
as of December 31, 2023, earnings after tax would have been €1 million (previous year: €7 million) lower."
"If the 
risk-adjusted interest rates as of December 31, 2023 had been 100 basis points lower, earnings after tax would 
have been €3 million (previous year: €4 million) higher."
"If the corresponding vehicle price used in the vehicle financing programs had been 10% higher as of Decem-
ber 31, 2023, earnings after tax would have been €10 million (previous year: €6 million) higher."
"If the correspond-
ing vehicle prices used in the vehicle financing programs had been 10% lower as of December 31, 2023, earnings 
after tax would have been €10 million (previous year: €6 million) lower."
"If the result of operations of equity investments measured at fair value had been 10% better as of December 31, 
2023, equity would have been €11 million (previous year: €9 million) higher, and earnings after tax would have 
been €12 million (previous year: €5 million) higher."
"If the result of operations of equity investments measured at 
fair value had been 10% worse, equity would have been €11 million (previous year: €9 million) lower, and earnings 
after tax would have been €30 million (previous year: €5 million) lower."
Other financial assets include receivables from tax allocations of €8 million (previous year: €10 million).
"The “Financial instruments” column shows the amounts that are subject to a master netting arrangement but 
were not set off because they do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet."
"The “Collateral received” 
and “Collateral pledged” columns show the amounts of cash collateral and collateral in the form of financial  
instruments received and pledged for the total assets and liabilities that do not meet the criteria for offsetting in 
the balance sheet."
Other financial liabilities include liabilities from tax allocations of €18 million (previous year: €17 million).
"The corresponding carrying amount of the receivables from the customer and dealer 
financing and the finance lease business amounted to €42.4 billion (previous year: €34.6 billion)."
"Collateral of 
€66.9 billion (previous year: €53.1 billion) in total was furnished as part of asset-backed securities transactions."
"The expected payments were assigned to structured entities and the equitable liens in the financed vehicles were 
transferred."
"These asset-backed securities transactions did not result in the receivables from financial services 
business being derecognized, as the Group retains nonpayment and late payment risks."
"The difference between 
the assigned receivables and the related liabilities is the result of different terms and conditions and the share of 
the securitized paper and notes held by the Volkswagen Group itself."
"Most of the public and private asset-backed securities transactions of the Volkswagen Group can be repaid in 
advance (clean-up call) if less than 10% of the original transaction volume is outstanding."
"The assigned receivables 
cannot be assigned again or pledged elsewhere as collateral."
"The claims of the holders of commercial paper and 
notes are limited to the assigned receivables and the receipts from those receivables are earmarked for the repay-
ment of the corresponding liability."
"As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the assigned receivables still recognized in the balance sheet was 
€41.3 billion (previous year: €32.8 billion)."
"The fair value of the related liabilities was €34.0 billion (previous 
year: €27.5 billion) at that reporting date."
"The Volkswagen Bank GmbH Group is contractually obliged, under certain conditions, to transfer funds to the 
structured entities that are included in its financial statements."
"In this case, collateral must be furnished for 
the resulting compensation claims against the special purpose entity, for example if the rating of the Group com-
pany concerned declines to a contractually agreed reference value."
"Net gains and losses in the category financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are mainly composed 
of the fair value measurement gains and losses on derivatives, including interest and gains and losses on currency 
translation."
"Net gains and losses from financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt 
instruments) relate to interest income from fixed-income securities."
"Net gains and losses from financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost mainly comprise interest 
income and expenses calculated according to the effective interest method pursuant to IFRS 9, currency trans-
lation effects, and the recognition of loss allowances."
"Interest also includes interest income and expenses from

"Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement classified into cash flows from operating activities, investing 
activities and financing activities, irrespective of the balance sheet classification."
Cash flows from operating activities are derived indirectly from earnings before tax.
"Earnings before tax are 
adjusted to eliminate non-cash expenditures (mainly depreciation, amortization and impairment losses) and  
income."
"Other non-cash income and expense results mainly from measurement effects in connection with finan-
cial instruments and fair value changes relating to hedging transactions."
"This results in cash flows from operating 
activities after accounting for changes in working capital, which also include changes in lease assets and in finan-
cial services receivables."
"Investing activities include additions to property, plant and equipment and equity investments, additions to 
capitalized development costs, and changes in investments in securities and time deposits as well as loans."
"Financing activities include outflows of funds from dividend payments and the redemption of bonds, inflows 
from capital increases and the issuance of bonds, and changes in other financial liabilities."
"Please refer to the 
“Equity” section for information on the in-/outflows from the issuance/repayment of hybrid capital contained in 
the capital contributions."
"The changes in balance sheet items that are presented in the cash flow statement cannot be derived directly 
from the balance sheet, as the effects of currency translation and changes in the consolidated Group are non-cash 
transactions and are therefore eliminated."
"In the fiscal year, cash flows from operating activities include interest received amounting to €12,567 million 
(previous year: €8,504 million) and interest paid amounting to €7,011 million (previous year: €3,274 million)."
"Cash 
flows from operating activities also include dividend payments (net of withholding tax) received from joint ven-

"For more information, see the section on financial risks in the Report on Risks and Opportunities of the group 
management report."
"Credit and default risk 
The credit and default risk arising from financial assets involves the risk of default by counterparties, and therefore 
comprises at a maximum the amount of the claims under carrying amounts receivable from them and the irrevo-
cable credit commitments."
"The maximum potential credit and default risk is reduced by collateral held and other 
credit enhancements."
Collateral is held predominantly for financial assets in the “at amortized cost” category.
"It 
relates primarily to collateral for financial services receivables and trade receivables."
"Collateral comprises vehi-
cles and assets transferred as security, as well as guarantees and real property liens."
"Cash collateral is also used 
in hedging transactions."
"For level 3 and level 4 financial assets with objective indications of impairment as of the reporting date, the 
collateral provided led to a reduction in risk by €1.3 billion (previous year: €1.1 billion)."
"Collateral of €6 million 
(previous year adjusted: €34 million) has been accepted for assets measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Significant cash and capital investments, as well as derivatives, are only entered into with national and inter-
national banks."
"Credit and default risk is limited by a limit system based primarily on the equity base of the coun-
terparties concerned and on credit assessments by international rating agencies."
"Financial guarantees issued also 
give rise to credit and default risk."
The maximum default risk is determined by the guarantee amount.
"The corre-
sponding amounts are presented in the Liquidity risk section."
"There were no material concentrations of risk at individual counterparties or counterparty groups in the fiscal 
year due to the global allocation of the Group’s business activities and the resulting diversification."
"This analysis excludes the items of Chinese companies in 
which Volkswagen holds an interest of 50% or less."
"Credit and default risk exposures at the end of 2023 accounted for 18.1% for Germany, compared with 15.2% 
at the end of 2022, and for 17.5% for China as against 14.0% at the end of 2022."
"There were no other material 
concentrations of credit and default risk exposures in individual countries."

Loss allowance 
The Volkswagen Group consistently uses the expected credit loss model of IFRS 9 for all financial assets and 
other risk exposures."
"The expected credit loss model under IFRS 9 takes in both loss allowances for financial assets for which there 
are no objective indications of impairment and loss allowances for financial assets that are already impaired."
"For 
the calculation of impairment losses, IFRS 9 distinguishes between the general approach and the simplified  
approach."
"Under the general approach, financial assets are allocated to one of three stages, plus an additional stage for 
financial assets that are already impaired when acquired (stage 4)."
"Stage 1 comprises financial assets that are 
recognized for the first time or for which the probability of default has not increased significantly."
"The expected 
credit losses for the next twelve months are calculated at this stage."
"Stage 2 comprises financial assets with a 
significantly increased probability of default, while financial assets with objective indications of default are allo-
cated to stage 3."
The lifetime expected credit losses are calculated at these stages.
"Stage 4 financial assets, which 
are already impaired when acquired, are subsequently measured by recognizing a loss allowance on the basis of 
the accumulated lifetime expected losses."
"Financial assets classified as impaired on acquisition remain in this 
category until they are derecognized."
"The Volkswagen Group applies the simplified approach to trade receivables and contract assets with a signifi-
cant financing component in accordance with IFRS 15."
"The same applies to receivables under operating or finance 
leases accounted for under IFRS 16."
"Under the simplified approach, the expected losses are consistently determined 
for the entire life of the asset."

Modifications 
There were contract modifications to financial assets in the reporting period that did not lead to the derecognition of 
the asset."
"These were primarily the result of changes in credit ratings and relate to financial assets for which loss 
allowances were measured in the amount of the expected lifetime credit losses."
"For trade and lease receivables, the 
treatment is simplified by considering the credit rating-based modifications where the receivables are more than 
30 days past due."
"Before the modification, amortized cost amount to €315 million (previous year: €548 million)."
"In the reporting period, contract modifications resulted in net income/net expenses of €– 1 million (previous year: 
€– 2 million)."
"As of the reporting date, the gross carrying amounts of financial assets that have been modified since initial 
recognition and were simultaneously reclassified from stage 2 or 3 to stage 1 in the reporting period amounted to 
€81 million (previous year: €324 million)."
"As a result, the measurement of the loss allowance for these financial 
assets was changed from lifetime expected credit losses to 12-month expected credit losses."

bles."
This mainly relates to vehicles.

"Liquidity risk 
The solvency and liquidity of the Volkswagen Group are secured by rolling liquidity planning, a liquidity reserve, 
confirmed credit lines and the issuance of securities on the international money and capital markets."
"The volume 
of confirmed bilateral and syndicated credit lines stood at €31.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 (previous 
year: €27.3 billion), of which €0.4 billion (previous year: €1.0 billion) was drawn down."
Local cash funds in certain countries (e.g.
"China, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and India) are only available to 
the Group for cross-border transactions subject to exchange controls."
"There are no significant restrictions over 
and above these."
"The liquidity risk in Argentina rose considerably as a result of the progressive depreciation of the 
Argentinian peso, especially in December 2023."
"It cannot be ruled out that the currency will depreciate further in 
fiscal year 2024."
"The cash outflows on other financial liabilities include outflows on liabilities for tax allocations amounting to 
€18 million (previous year: €17 million)."
"Derivatives comprise both cash flows from derivative financial instruments with negative fair values and cash 
flows from derivatives with positive fair values for which a gross settlement has been agreed."
"Derivatives entered 
into through offsetting transactions are also accounted for as cash outflows."
"The cash outflows from derivatives 
for which a gross settlement has been agreed are matched in part by cash inflows."
"These cash inflows are not 
reported in the maturity analysis."
"If these cash inflows were also recognized, the cash outflows presented would 
be substantially lower."
This also particularly applies if hedges have been closed with offsetting transactions.
"The cash outflows from obligations from loan commitments and irrevocable credit commitments are presented 
in the section entitled “Other financial obligations”, classified by contractual maturities."
"As of December 31, 2023, the maximum potential liability under financial guarantees amounted to €910 million 
(previous year: €1,185 million)."
Financial guarantees are assumed to be due immediately in all cases.

4.1 HEDGING POLICY AND FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES 
During the course of its general business activities, the Volkswagen Group is exposed to foreign currency, interest 
rate, commodity price, equity price and fund price risk."
Corporate policy is to limit such risk by means of hedging.
"Disclosures on gains and losses from fair value hedges 
Fair value hedges involve hedging against the risk of changes in the carrying amount of balance sheet items."
"As 
of the reporting date, both hedging instruments and hedged items are measured at fair value in relation to the 
hedged risk, and the resulting opposite changes in value are recognized in the corresponding income statement 
item."
"The following table shows the gains and losses from fair value hedges by risk type: 
DISCLOSURES ON GAINS AND LOSSES FROM FAIR VALUE HEDGES 
 
  
  
€ million 
 
Dec."
"These cash flows may arise 
from a recognized asset or liability, or from a highly probable forecast transaction."
"The gain or loss from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments used in hedge accounting corresponds to 
the basis for determining hedge ineffectiveness."
"The ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is the income or 
expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that exceed the changes in the fair 
value of the hedged item."
"This hedge ineffectiveness is attributable to differences in the parameters for the hedg-
ing instrument and the hedged item."
"Such income and expenses are recognized in other operating income/ 
expenses or in the financial result."
"381 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
The Volkswagen Group uses two different methods to present market risk from nonderivative and derivative  
financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 7."
"The value-at-risk calculation indicates the size of the maximum potential loss on the portfolio as a whole 
within a time horizon of 60 days, measured at a confidence level of 99%."
"To provide the basis for this calculation, 
all cash flows from nonderivative and derivative financial instruments are aggregated into an interest rate gap 
analysis."
The historical market data used in calculating VaR covers a period of four years.
"The sensitivity analysis 
calculates the effect on equity and profit or loss by modifying risk variables within the respective market risks."
"Disclosures on hedging instruments in hedge accounting 
The Volkswagen Group regularly enters into hedging instruments to hedge against changes in the carrying 
amount of balance sheet items."
"383 
Consolidated Financial Statements

Disclosures on hedged items in hedge accounting 
In addition to disclosures on hedging instruments, disclosures are also required on the hedged items, broken 
down by risk category and type of designation for hedge accounting."
"All changes beyond this in the fair value of the designated component are recognized as inef-
fectiveness in profit or loss."

If expectations about the occurrence of the hedged item change, the arrangement is reclassified by terminating 
the hedging relationship prematurely."
"Changed expectations are primarily caused by a change in projections for 
hedging sales revenue."
"Changes in the fair values of non-designated components of a derivative are likewise generally recognized 
immediately through profit or loss."
"An exception from this principle is any change in the fair value attributable to 
non-designated time values of options, to the extent that they relate to the hedged item."
"Moreover, the Volkswagen 
Group initially recognizes in equity (hedging costs) changes in the fair values of non-designated forward compo-
nents in currency forwards and currency hedges attributed to cash flow hedges."
"This means that the Volkswagen 
Group recognizes changes in the fair value of the non-designated component respectively parts thereof immedi-
ately through profit or loss only if there is ineffectiveness."

"Currency forwards, currency options, currency

"The principle of matching currencies applies to the 
Group’s financing activities."
"All nonfunctional currencies in which the Volkswagen Group enters into financial instruments are included as 
relevant risk variables in the sensitivity analysis in accordance with IFRS 7."
"If the functional currencies concerned had appreciated or depreciated by 10% against the other currencies, the 
exchange rates shown below would have resulted in the following effects on the hedging reserve in equity and on 
earnings after tax."
"It is not appropriate to add together the individual figures, since the results of the various func-
tional currencies concerned are based on different scenarios."

"Interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to hedge against this risk, partially as fair 
value or cash flow hedge, and depending on market conditions."
"Intragroup financing arrangements are mainly 
structured to match the maturities of their refinancing."
"Departures from the Group standard are subject to cen-
trally defined limits and monitored on an ongoing basis."
Interest rate risk within the meaning of IFRS 7 is calculated using sensitivity analyses.
"The effects of the risk-
variable market rates of interest on the financial result and on equity are presented, net of tax."
"If market interest rates had been 100 bps higher as of December 31, 2023, equity would have been €21 million 
(previous year: €20 million) lower."
"If market interest rates had been 100 bps lower as of December 31, 2023, equity 
would have been €22 million (previous year: €22 million) higher."
"If market interest rates had been 100 bps higher as of December 31, 2023, earnings after tax would have been 
€362 million (previous year: €143 million) lower."
"If market interest rates had been 100 bps lower as of December 
31, 2023, earnings after tax would have been €382 million (previous year: €149 million) higher."
Commodity price risk is limited by entering into forward transactions and swaps.
"However, not all commodities are suitable for these types of hedges, e.g."
"because of low market liquidity or a 
lack of correlation between hedged item and hedging instrument."
"Likewise, selected commodities were pur-
chased on the spot market, which led to a corresponding increase in inventories."
"Commodity price risk within the 
meaning of IFRS 7 is presented using sensitivity analyses."
"These show what effect changes in the commodity price 
risk variable would have on earnings after tax and on equity."
"If the commodity prices of the hedged nonferrous metals, coal and rubber had been 10% higher (lower) as of 
December 31, 2023, earnings after tax would have been €648 million (previous year: €954 million) higher (lower)."
"If commodity prices in hedging transactions to which hedge accounting is applied had been 10% higher (lower) 
as of December 31, 2023, equity would have been €27 million higher (lower)."
"As of the end of 2022, there were no 
hedging relationships that qualified for hedge accounting."
"The changes in bond prices resulting from variations in the market 
rates of interest are quantified in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, as are the measurement of foreign currency and other 
interest rate risks arising from the special funds and the equity interests measured at fair value."
"As a rule, risks 
arising from the special funds are countered by ensuring a broad diversification of products, issuers and regional 
markets when investing funds, as stipulated by the Investment Guidelines of the Group."
"In addition, the Invest-
ment Guidelines define fixed minimum values, which are to be met by taking suitable risk management measures."
"In addition, hedgings are executed when market conditions are appropriate."
"390 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
As part of the presentation of market risk, IFRS 7 requires disclosures on how hypothetical changes in risk varia-
bles affect the price of financial instruments."
"Potential risk variables here are in particular quoted market prices 
or indices, as well as interest rate changes as bond price parameters."
"If share prices had been 10% higher as of December 31, 2023, earnings after tax would have been €290 million 
(previous year: €107 million) higher and equity would have been €4 million (previous year: €4 million) higher."
"If 
share prices had been 10% lower as of December 31, 2023, earnings after tax would have been €270 million (pre-
vious year: €65 million) lower and equity would have been €4 million (previous year: €4 million) lower."
"4.3 MARKET RISK AT VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES SUBGROUP 
Exchange rate risk in the Volkswagen Financial Services subgroup is mainly attributable to assets that are not 
denominated in the functional currency and from refinancing within operating activities."
"Interest rate risk relates 
to refinancing without matching maturities and the varying interest rate elasticity of individual asset and liability 
items."
The risks are limited by the use of currency and interest rate hedges.
Microhedges are used for interest rate hedging.
"Fixed-rate assets and liabilities included in the hedging strat-
egy are recognized at fair value, as opposed to their original subsequent measurement at amortized cost."
"The  
resulting effects in the income statement are offset by the corresponding gains and losses on the interest rate 
hedging instruments (swaps)."
"Currency hedges (currency forwards and cross-currency interest rate swaps) are 
used to mitigate foreign currency risk."
All cash flows in foreign currency are hedged.
"As of December 31, 2023, the value at risk was €976 million (previous year: €792 million) for interest rate risk 
and €133 million (previous year: €76 million) for foreign currency risk."
"The entire value at risk for interest rate and foreign currency risk at the Volkswagen Financial Services subgroup 
was €893 million (previous year: €720 million)."
"Methods for monitoring hedge effectiveness 
Since the implementation of IFRS 9, the Volkswagen Group determines hedge effectiveness mainly on a prospec-
tive basis using the critical terms match method."
"Retrospective analysis of effectiveness uses a test for ineffec-
tivities in the form of the dollar offset method."
"Under the dollar offset method, the changes in value of the hedged 
item expressed in monetary units are compared with the changes in value of the hedging instrument expressed 
in monetary units."
"To this end, the accumulated changes in the fair value of the designated spot component of the hedging  
instrument and hedged item are compared."
"If the critical terms do not match, the same procedure is applied to the 
non-designated component."
"The offsetting transactions cancel out the effects of the original hedging trans-
actions."
"If the offsetting transactions were not included, the respective notional amount would be lower."
"In addi-
tion to the derivatives used for hedging foreign currency, interest rate and price risk, the Group held options and 
other derivatives on equity instruments at the reporting date, mainly in connection with fund investments."
"The 
notional volume with a remaining maturity of less than one year was €19.9 billion (previous year: €17.9 billion)."
"The notional volume with a remaining maturity of more than one year was €4.2 billion (previous year: €4.2 billion) 
and relates primarily to options in connection with the acquisition of Europcar."
"Also in connection with fund investments, the Group held credit default swaps with a notional amount of 
€32.2 billion (previous year: €17.5 billion)."
"Existing cash flow hedges in the notional amount of €5.2 billion (previous year: €2.0 billion) were discontinued 
because of a reduction in the projections."
"In addition, hedges were to be terminated due to internal risk regulations."
"Items hedged under cash flow hedges are expected to be realized in accordance with the maturity buckets of 
the hedges reported in the table."
"For cash flow hedges, the Volkswagen Group achieved an average hedging  
interest rate of 2.93% for hedging interest rate risk."
"In addition, currency risk was hedged at the following hedging 
exchange rates for the major currency pairs: EUR/USD at 1.16; EUR/GBP at 0.88; EUR/CNY at 7.39."
"The average hedging prices used in commodity price hedging were USD 2,332.15/tonne for aluminum and 
USD 8,359.11/tonne for copper."
"The fair values of the derivatives are estimated using market data at the balance sheet date as well as by  
appropriate valuation techniques."
"Capital management 
The Group’s capital management ensures that its goals and strategies can be achieved in the interests of share-
holders, employees and other stakeholders."
"In particular, management focuses on generating the minimum return 
on invested assets in the Automotive Division that is required by the capital markets, and on increasing the return 
on equity in the Financial Services Division."
"In the process, it aims overall to achieve the highest possible growth 
in the value of the Group and its divisions for the benefit of all the Company’s stakeholder groups."
"Value contribution is defined as the difference between operating profit after tax and the opportunity cost of 
invested capital."
"The opportunity cost of capital is calculated by multiplying the market cost of capital by average 
invested capital."
"Invested capital is calculated by taking the operating assets reported in the balance sheet (prop-
erty, plant and equipment, intangible assets, lease assets, inventories and receivables) and deducting non-inter-
est-bearing liabilities (trade payables and payments on account received)."
"Average invested capital is derived from 
the balance at the beginning and the end of the reporting period."
"394 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
The return on investment is defined as the return on invested capital for a particular period based on the operating 
result after tax."
"If the return on investment exceeds the market cost of capital, there is an increase in the value of 
the invested capital and a positive value contribution."
"In the Group, a minimum required rate of return on invested 
capital of 9.0% is defined, which applies to both the business units and the individual products and product lines."
The goal of generating a sustained return on investment of over 18.0% is anchored in the company’s strategy.
"The 
return on investment therefore serves as a consistent target in operational and strategic management and is used 
to measure target attainment for the Automotive Division, the individual business units, and projects and products."
"The return on investment achieved for the Automotive Division was 12.3% in the reporting period, which is above 
the minimum rate of return on invested capital of 9.0%."
"Given the current cost of capital of 8.5%, this results in a 
positive value contribution of €4,727 million."
"Due to the specific features of the Financial Services Division, its management focuses on return on equity, a 
special target linked to invested capital."
"This measure is calculated as the ratio of earnings before tax to average 
equity."
Average equity is calculated from the balance at the beginning and the end of the reporting period.
"In  
addition, the goals of the Financial Services Division are to meet the banking supervisory authorities’ regulatory 
capital requirements, to procure equity for the growth planned in the coming fiscal years and to support its external 
rating by ensuring capital adequacy."
"To ensure compliance with prudential requirements at all times, a planning 
procedure integrated into internal reporting has been put in place at the Volkswagen Bank, allowing the required 
equity to be continuously determined on the basis of actual and expected business performance."
"In the reporting 
period, this again ensured that regulatory minimum capital requirements were always met both at Group level and 
at the level of subordinate companies’ individual, specific capital requirements."

Dec."
"The other contingent liabilities primarily comprise potential liabilities arising from matters relating to taxes and 
customs duties, as well as litigation and proceedings relating to suppliers, dealers, customers, employees and 
investors."
"The contingent liabilities recognized in connection with the diesel issue totaled €4.0 billion (previous 
year: €4.2 billion), of which €3.8 billion (previous year: €3.6 billion) was attributable to investor lawsuits in Ger-
many."
"Also included are certain elements of the class action lawsuits and proceedings/misdemeanor proceedings 
relating to the diesel issue as far as these can be quantified."
"As some of these proceedings are still at a very early 
stage, the plaintiffs have in a number of cases so far not specified the basis of their claims and/or there is insuffi-
cient certainty about the number of plaintiffs or the amounts being claimed."
"Where these lawsuits meet the defi-
nition of a contingent liability, no disclosure was normally required because it had not been possible to measure 
the amount involved."
"In addition, other contingent liabilities include an amount of €0.6 billion for potential liabilities resulting from 
the risk of tax proceedings instituted by the Brazilian tax authorities against Volkswagen Truck & Bus (formerly: 
MAN Latin America)."
"National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced further exten-
sions of the recalls of various models from a variety of manufacturers containing certain airbags produced by the 
Takata company."
Recalls were also demanded by the local authorities in individual countries.
"The recalls also  
included models manufactured by the Volkswagen Group."
Appropriate provisions have been recognized.
"Currently, 
the possibility of further extensions to the recalls that could also affect Volkswagen Group models cannot be ruled 
out."
"It is not possible at the moment to provide further disclosures in accordance with IAS 37.86 in relation to this 
matter because the technical investigations and consultations with the authorities are still ongoing."
"In line with IAS 37.92, no further statements have been made concerning estimates of financial impact or  
regarding uncertainty as to the amount or maturity of provisions and contingent liabilities in relation to additional 
important legal cases."
"This is so as to not compromise the results of the proceedings or the interests of the Com-
pany."

"Litigation 
Volkswagen AG and the companies in which it is directly or indirectly invested are involved in a substantial num-
ber of legal disputes and governmental proceedings in Germany and abroad."
"Such legal disputes and other pro-
ceedings occur, among other things, in connection with products and services or in relation to employees, public 
authorities, dealers, investors, customers, suppliers, or other contracting parties."
"For the companies in question, 
these disputes and proceedings may result in payments such as fines or in other obligations or consequences."
"In 
particular, substantial compensatory or punitive damages may have to be paid and cost-intensive measures may 
have to be implemented."
"In this context, specific estimation of the objectively likely consequences is often possi-
ble only to a very limited extent, if at all."
"Various legal proceedings are pending worldwide, particularly in the USA, in which customers are asserting 
purported product-related claims, either individually or in class actions."
"These claims are as a rule based on  
alleged vehicle defects, including defects alleged in vehicle parts supplied to the Volkswagen Group."
Compliance with legal or regulatory requirements is another area in which risks may arise.
"This is particularly 
true in gray areas where Volkswagen and the relevant public authorities may interpret the law differently."
"In connection with their business activities, Volkswagen Group companies engage in constant dialogue with 
regulatory agencies, including the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA – German Federal Motor Transport Authority)."
"It is 
not possible to predict with assurance how government regulators will assess certain issues of fact and law in a 
particular situation."
"For this reason, the possibility that certain vehicle characteristics and/or type approval  
aspects may in particular ultimately be deemed deficient or impermissible cannot be ruled out."
"This is fundamen-
tally a question of the regulatory agency’s specific evaluation in a concrete situation."
"A comparable challenge results from the tension between divergent national and international statutory or 
regulatory requirements regarding obligations to transfer information or documents, on the one hand, and privacy 
mandates under national and international data protection law on the other."
"Volkswagen is advised by outside law 
firms on these issues so as to preclude compliance violations as far as possible despite the sometimes unclear 
state of the law."
"Litigation may furthermore result from demands for more extensive climate protection measures or from alleg-
edly incomplete disclosures regarding the impact of climate change."
"Risks may also result from actions for infringement of intellectual property, including infringement of patents, 
brands, or other third-party rights, particularly in Germany, before the Unified Patent Court and in the United States."
"Criminal acts by individuals, which even the best compliance management system can never completely pre-
vent, are another potential source of legal risks."
"Appropriate insurance has been taken out to cover these risks where they were sufficiently definite and such 
coverage was economically sensible."
"Where necessary based on the information currently available, identified and 
correspondingly measurable risks have been reflected by recognizing provisions in amounts considered appropri-
ate or disclosing contingent liabilities, as the case may be."
"As some risks cannot be assessed or can only be  
assessed to a limited extent, the possibility of material loss or damage not covered by the insured amounts or by 
provisions cannot be ruled out."
"This is, for instance, the case with regard to the legal risks assessed in connection 
with the diesel issue."
"Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the amounts disclosed for the litigation being reported on refer only to the 
respective principal claim."
"Ancillary claims, such as for interest and litigation expense, are generally not consid-
ered."
"In this context, Volkswagen AG  
announced that noticeable discrepancies between the figures recorded in testing and those measured in actual 
road use had been identified in type EA 189 diesel engines and that this engine type had been installed in roughly 
eleven million vehicles worldwide."
"On November 2, 2015, the EPA issued a “Notice of Violation” alleging that 
irregularities had also been discovered in the software installed in US vehicles with type V6 3.0 l diesel engines."
"The so-called diesel issue is rooted in a modification of parts of the software of the relevant engine control 
units – which, according to Volkswagen AG’s legal position, is only unlawful under US law – for the type EA 189 
diesel engines that Volkswagen AG was developing at that time."
"This software function was developed and  
implemented from 2006 on without knowledge at the level of the Board of Management."
"Members of the Board of 
Management did not learn of the development and implementation of this software function until the summer of 
2015."
"Rather, at the time the 2014 annual and consolidated 
financial statements were being prepared, the persons responsible for preparing these financial statements  
remained under the impression that the issue could be resolved with comparatively little expense."
"This culminated 
in Volkswagen's disclosure of a “defeat device” to the EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB), a  
department of the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of California, on September 3, 2015."
"It therefore appeared to be 
manageable overall considering the business activities of the Volkswagen Group."
"This assessment by Volkswagen 
AG was based, among other things, on the advice of a law firm engaged in the USA for regulatory approval issues, 
according to which similar cases had in the past been amicably resolved with the US authorities."
"The EPA’s publi-
cation of the “Notice of Violation” on September 18, 2015, which the Board of Management had not expected, 
especially at that time, then presented the situation in an entirely different light."
"398 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
As a consequence of the diesel issue, numerous judicial and regulatory proceedings were initiated in various 
countries."
"Volkswagen has in the interim succeeded in making substantial progress and ending many of these 
proceedings."
"In the USA, Volkswagen AG and certain affiliates reached settlement agreements with various gov-
ernment authorities and private plaintiffs, the latter represented by a Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee in a multidis-
trict litigation in the US state of California."
"The agreements in question include various partial consent decrees as 
well as a plea agreement that resolved certain civil claims as well as criminal charges under US federal law and 
the laws of certain US states in connection with the diesel issue."
"Although Volkswagen is firmly committed to 
fulfilling the obligations arising from these agreements, a breach of these obligations cannot be completely ruled 
out."
"In the event of a violation, significant penalties could be imposed as stipulated in the agreements, in addition 
to the possibility of further monetary fines, criminal sanctions and injunctive relief."
"In agreement with the respective responsible authorities, the Volkswagen Group is making technical measures 
available worldwide for virtually all diesel vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"For all clusters (groups of vehicles) 
within its jurisdiction, the KBA determined that implementation of the technical measures would not result in any 
adverse changes in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, engine output, maximum torque, and noise emissions."
"Following the studies carried out by AUDI AG to check all relevant diesel concepts for possible irregularities 
and retrofit potential, measures proposed by AUDI AG have been adopted and mandated by the KBA in various 
recall orders pertaining to vehicle models with V6 and V8 TDI engines."
"AUDI AG continues to anticipate that the 
total cost, including recall expenses, of the ongoing largely software-based retrofit program that began in July 
2017 will be manageable and has recognized corresponding balance-sheet risk provisions."
"AUDI AG has in the 
meantime developed software updates for many of the affected powertrains and, after approval by the KBA,  
already installed these updates in the vehicles of a large number of affected customers."
"KBA approval is still  
expected for the small number of software updates that are still pending."
"In connection with the diesel issue, potential consequences for Volkswagen’s results of operations, financial 
position and net assets could emerge primarily in the following legal areas: 
1."
"Criminal and administrative proceedings worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada) 
Criminal investigations, regulatory offense proceedings, and/or administrative proceedings have been com-
menced in some countries."
"Criminal investigations into the core factual issues are being conducted by the Offices 
of the Public Prosecutor in Braunschweig and Munich."
"Pursuant to a motion filed by the Braunschweig Office 
of the Public Prosecutor, the Braunschweig Regional Court reopened the proceedings against the former Chair of 
the Board of Management in December 2023."
"This case will now move forward; the Braunschweig Regional Court 
has as yet set no date for commencement of the trial."
"In September 2020, the Braunschweig Regional Court allowed the indictment of the same former Chair of the 
Board of Management of Volkswagen AG to proceed on charges that include fraud in connection with the diesel 
issue involving type EA 189 engines."
"The proceedings against this former Chair of the Board of Management of 
Volkswagen AG have since been severed from the other cases."
"The trial of the other defendants began in Septem-
ber 2021."
"399 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes 
 
The Braunschweig Office of the Public Prosecutor conducted investigations on suspicion of fraud in connection 
with type EA 288 engines."
"The proceedings against the accused employees and against Volkswagen AG were 
terminated in late 2022 and early 2023, definitively against payment of a sum set by the court in the case of three 
of the accused persons and provisionally as regards four others."
"The trial before the Munich II Regional Court concluded in June 2023; the 
former Chair of the Board of Management of AUDI AG and the other two defendants were sentenced to prison 
terms, the enforcement of which was in each case suspended subject to probation."
"The conditions of probation 
include the payment of sums set by the court."
The judgment is not yet final.
"All three defendants have filed appeals 
on issues of law."
"The Office of the Public Prosecutor has likewise appealed the judgment against one of the de-
fendants."
"In April 2023, the Munich II Regional Court had previously terminated the proceedings against an addi-
tional former defendant against payment of a sum set by the court."
"In August 2020, the Munich II Office of the Public Prosecutor issued a further indictment charging three former 
members of the Board of Management of AUDI AG and others with, among other things, fraud in connection with 
the diesel issue involving 3.0 l and 4.2 l TDI engines."
"The Munich II Regional Court has not yet decided whether to 
accept the indictment."
"As the type approval authority of proper jurisdiction, the KBA is moreover continuously testing Audi, 
Volkswagen, and Porsche brand vehicles for problematic functions."
"If certain functions are deemed impermissible 
by the KBA, the affected vehicles are recalled pursuant to a recall order or they are brought back into compliance 
by means of a voluntary service measure."
"In judgments rendered in July and November 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that a so-called 
thermal window (i.e."
"a temperature-dependent exhaust gas recirculation) in the range of 15°C and 33°C outside 
temperature represents a defeat device."
"In July and October 2023, the KBA issued two administrative rulings against AUDI AG in which it ruled 
that the originally incorporated thermal window version failed to meet the ECJ’s new vehicle engineering criterion 
in some of the affected vehicles."
"AUDI AG has appealed the rulings, and they are therefore not final."
"The KBA issued 
corresponding administrative rulings against Porsche AG in December 2023 and against Volkswagen AG in Jan-
uary 2024."
Porsche AG and Volkswagen AG have appealed the rulings.
"The Volkswagen Group had previously  
already begun rolling out software updates that modify the thermal window in accordance with the ECJ’s new 
vehicle engineering criterion and will continue to do so."
Altitude correction refers to altitude-dependent exhaust gas recirculation.
"The 
taxi switch modifies exhaust gas recirculation when a vehicle with a running engine stands motionless for a certain 
period of time."
Volkswagen AG is involved in the litigation as an interested party summoned.
"In late April 2023, 
Volkswagen AG and the KBA filed appeals against the judgment of the Schleswig Administrative Court."
"This deci-
sion is thus not legally final."
DUH has filed two additional lawsuits with the Schleswig Administrative Court.
"The 
first action contests the notices of approval for further Audi and Porsche brand vehicles equipped with type EA 189 
engines as well as with selected V-TDI engines; the second action is directed against all Group diesel vehicles 
with the Euro-5 and Euro-6b/c exhaust emission standard."
"The court granted both leave 
to appeal (on points of fact and law) and to leap-frog appeal (on points of law)."
"This decision is thus not legally 
final."
"Moreover, additional administrative proceedings relating to the diesel issue are ongoing in other jurisdictions."
The companies of the Volkswagen Group are cooperating with the government authorities.
"Risks may furthermore result from possible decisions by the European Court of Justice construing EU type 
approval provisions."
"Whether the criminal and administrative proceedings will ultimately result in fines or other consequences for 
the Company, and if so what amounts these may entail, is currently subject to estimation risks."
"According to 
Volkswagen’s estimates, the likelihood that a sanction will be imposed is 50 % or less in the majority of these 
proceedings."
"Contingent liabilities have therefore been disclosed where the amount of such liabilities could be 
measured and the likelihood of a sanction being imposed was assessed at not less than 10 %."
"Product-related lawsuits worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada) 
A general possibility exists that customers in the affected markets will file civil lawsuits or that importers and 
dealers will assert recourse claims against Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group companies."
"Besides  
individual lawsuits, various forms of collective actions (i.e."
"assertion of individual claims by plaintiffs acting jointly 
or as representatives of a class) are available in various jurisdictions."
"Furthermore, in a number of markets it is 
possible for consumer and/or environmental organizations to bring suit to enforce alleged rights to injunctive 
relief, declaratory judgment, or damages."
These actions asserted alleged rights to damages and other relief.
"The pending actions included in 
particular the following: 
Pending in Belgium is a class action filed by the Belgian consumer organization Test Aankoop VZW seeking 
repayment of the purchase price or damages in the alternative; an opt-out mechanism has been held to apply to 
this action."
"Given the opt-out rule, the class action potentially covers all vehicles with type EA 189 engines pur-
chased by consumers on the Belgian market after September 1, 2014, unless the right to opt out is actively exer-
cised."
"The judg-
ment is not yet final."
"In Brazil, two consumer protection class actions are pending."
"Following Volkswagen do Brasil’s 
appeal, the Superior Court of Justice vacated its own prior decision in its entirety."
"The case was remanded to the 
lower appellate court for rehearing of certain issues."
Volkswagen do Brasil is permitted to introduce new evidence.
"The judgment is enforceable, but remains non-final."
"In the second class action, which pertains to roughly 67 thou-
sand later generation Amarok vehicles, the appeal filed by the plaintiff against the October 2021 trial court judg-
ment dismissing its complaint was rejected by the appellate court in June 2023."
"The plaintiff has appealed this 
decision to the Superior Court of Justice."
"Following the withdrawal of numerous motions for relief, approximately 9 thousand 
claims are currently still pending."
"Provisions were recognized to account for the possibility that objectively valu-
able claims may again be raised in or out of court."
"These actions 
are in a very early procedural stage."
"No Group company has as yet been formally served with a complete statement 
of the grounds of the complaint, and a number of the plaintiffs’ claims have yet to be specified in detail."
"This is an opt-in class action in which CLCV is primarily seeking rescission without compensation 
for use of the vehicle or, in the alternative, damages amounting to 20-30% of the purchase price."
"The judgment was largely overturned pursuant to the appeal filed 
by Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Group Italia."
"Per this decision, the consumers validly registered in the class 
action will receive merely €300 each."
"In the Netherlands, an opt-out class action is pending that was brought by Stichting Volkswagen Car Claim 
seeking declaratory rulings for up to 201 thousand customers."
"A declaratory judgment partially granting the relief 
sought was issued in July 2021."
"In the opinion of the court, Volkswagen AG and the other defendant Group com-
panies acted unlawfully with respect to the original engine management software."
"The court moreover held that 
consumers are entitled to a purchase price reduction from the defendant dealerships."
"No specific payment obli-
gations result from the declaratory judgment."
"Any individual claims would then have to be established afterwards 
in separate proceedings."
Volkswagen AG and the other defendant Group companies appealed the decision.
"Fur-
thermore, an opt-out class action lawsuit brought by the Diesel Emissions Justice Foundation (DEJF) seeking 
monetary damages on behalf of Dutch consumers is also pending; the action involves vehicles with type EA 189 
engines, among others."
"The trial court rendered an interlocutory judgment in March 2022 holding the new class 
action regime – which permits damage awards in addition to declaratory judgment on the existence of claims – to 
be inapplicable to the instant lawsuit."
"The interlocutory judgment further finds that the Amsterdam court lacks 
jurisdiction to hear lawsuits brought by consumers outside the Netherlands."
"The court suspended further trial level pro-
ceedings pending a decision by the appellate court."
"In Portugal, a Portuguese consumer organization had filed an opt-out class action potentially affecting up to 
approximately 70 thousand vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"In July 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed the 
class action as inadmissible because the plaintiff consumer organization lacked standing to sue."
"The judgment 
became final in September 2023."
"In South Africa, an opt-out class action seeking damages is pending; the action pertains to some 80 thousand 
vehicles, including vehicles with type EA 189 engines."

Furthermore, individual lawsuits and similar proceedings are pending against Volkswagen AG and other 
Volkswagen Group companies in various countries; most of these lawsuits are seeking damages or rescission of 
the purchase contract."
"In Germany, roughly 25 thousand individual lawsuits relating to various diesel engine types are currently pend-
ing against Volkswagen AG or other Group companies, with the plaintiffs suing for damages or rescission of the 
contract in most cases."
"In 2020, the BGH issued a series of fundamental judgments deciding legal issues of major importance for the 
litigation still pending with regard to vehicles with type EA 189 engines."
"The BGH held that buyers who had pur-
chased vehicles prior to public disclosure of the diesel issue could return their vehicles to Volkswagen AG and 
receive a refund of the purchase price paid, less a deduction for the benefit derived from using the vehicle."
"How-
ever, buyers had no tort-based claim for damages if they purchased their vehicles after the ad hoc announcement 
of September 22, 2015 or if they raise claims based solely on a temperature-dependent exhaust gas recirculation 
(so-called thermal window) in the engine."
"The BGH held that buyers must return 
their vehicles in order to claim payment and that such payment was reduced by the benefit derived from using the 
vehicle and by the dealer profit margin."
"In an additional fundamental judgment rendered in July 2022 concerning 
vehicles with EA 189 engines, the BGH held that buyers of new vehicles of other Group brands have no claim for 
residual damages against Volkswagen AG."
"In late June 2023, the BGH handed down judgments in lawsuits against Volkswagen AG and AUDI AG posing 
the issue as to how the case law of the ECJ on the potential claims of buyers under European type approval law 
should be implemented in German law."
"The BGH held that the negligent use of an impermissible defeat device 
may in principle entitle plaintiffs to differential damages in tort amounting to 5 % to 15 % of their vehicle’s purchase 
price."
Whether this claim is given in a particular instance is for the appeals courts to determine.
"The BGH stated 
that, when deciding whether a deactivation device was impermissible, it did not matter whether the limits in the 
NEDC testing procedure would be complied with even when system functioning was modified."
"The BGH held that 
liability does not arise where the manufacturer is not at fault, e.g."
"because the relevant public authority had  
approved the deactivation device in its specific configuration and taking account of identified combinations of 
deactivation devices, or would have done so upon request."
"Where a claim for differential damages exists in prin-
ciple, the buyer must furthermore accept an offset for the benefit derived from using the vehicle and for the vehi-
cle’s value to the extent these exceed the vehicle’s diminished value."
"An implemented software update may also 
potentially mitigate damages."
"Volkswagen estimates the likelihood that the plaintiffs will prevail to be 50 % or less in the great majority of 
cases: customer class actions, complaints filed by consumer and/or environmental organizations, and individual 
lawsuits."
"Contingent liabilities are disclosed for these proceedings where the amount of such liabilities can be 
measured and the chance that the plaintiff will prevail was assessed as not remote."
"Given the early stage of the 
proceedings, it is in some cases not yet possible to quantify the realistic risk exposure."
"Furthermore, provisions 
were recognized to the extent necessary based on the current assessment."
"At this time, it cannot be estimated how many customers will choose to file lawsuits in the future in addition to 
those already pending and what prospect of success such lawsuits might have."

"Almost all investor lawsuits are now pending before the Braunschweig Regional Court or the Braunschweig 
Higher Regional Court."
"The investor lawsuits pending against Volkswagen AG 
in Germany are stayed pending resolution of the common issues, unless the cases can be dismissed for reasons 
independent of the common issues that are to be adjudicated in the model case proceedings."
"The resolution in the 
model case proceedings of the common questions of law and fact will be binding for the pending cases that have 
been stayed as described."
The model case plaintiff is Deka Investment GmbH.
"Oral argument in the model case 
proceedings before the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court began in September 2018."
"The Braunschweig Higher 
Regional Court issued several notification rulings stating its position on certain legal issues of fundamental im-
portance for the litigation."
"In July 2023, the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court issued an order for the taking of 
evidence including the examination of numerous persons as well as the production and consultation of documents 
and records."
"Volkswagen AG has the burden of proof on some  
issues."
The taking of testimony commenced in September 2023.
"To date, none of the witnesses examined has 
testified to having personal knowledge or to knowledge on the part of persons with ad hoc disclosure responsi-
bility."
Several witnesses invoked a privilege against giving testimony.
"In some cases (not as to persons with ad hoc 
disclosure responsibility), the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court affirmed a comprehensive right to refuse to 
testify."
"The implications of the refusal to testify given Volkswagen AG’s burden of proof cannot be assessed  
abstractly."
"Pursuant to § 286 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court must decide 
at its discretion and conviction, taking account of the entire content of the hearings and the results of the evidence 
taken."
"Further investor lawsuits are pending before the Stuttgart Regional Court against Volkswagen AG, in some 
cases along with Porsche SE as joint and several debtor."
"An additional investor action for model declaratory judg-
ment was filed with the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court against Porsche SE; Volkswagen AG is involved in this 
action as a third party intervening in support of a party to the dispute."
"The Wolverhampton City Council, Adminis-
trating Authority for the West Midlands Metropolitan Authorities Pension Fund, was appointed model case plaintiff."
The Stuttgart Higher Regional Court rendered a model declaratory judgment in late March 2023.
"Based on the 
determinations made in the model declaratory judgment and the current substantive status of the underlying  
actions, all of the suspended investor lawsuits against Porsche SE would in effect have to be dismissed."
"The model 
declaratory judgment is not yet final."
"The model case plaintiff, several interested parties summoned, and Porsche 
SE petitioned the BGH for review on points of law."
"Volkswagen AG joined the proceedings as a third-party sup-
porting the petition for review of Porsche SE."
"Excluding the United States and Canada, claims in connection with the diesel issue totaling roughly €9.2 billion 
are currently pending worldwide against Volkswagen AG in the form of investor lawsuits, judicial applications for 
dunning and conciliation procedures, and claims under the KapMuG."
"To date, claims in the high triple-digit-millions 
range have been withdrawn or finally and conclusively dismissed."
"Volkswagen AG remains of the opinion that it 
duly complied with its capital market obligations."
"Therefore, no provisions have been recognized for these investor 
lawsuits."

"Special audit 
In a November 2017 ruling, the Higher Regional Court of Celle ordered, upon the request of three US funds, the 
appointment of a special auditor for Volkswagen AG."
"The special auditor was supposed to examine whether the 
members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG breached their duties in connec-
tion with the diesel issue from June 22, 2006 onwards and, if so, whether this resulted in damages for 
Volkswagen AG."
"Volkswagen AG had filed a constitutional complaint with the German Federal Constitutional 
Court against this decision, which was originally unappealable as formal matter."
"Volkswagen AG also filed a con-
stitutional complaint against the subsequent (and likewise formally unappealable) decision by the Higher  
Regional Court of Celle to appoint a special auditor other than the one initially appointed."
"Proceedings in the case concerning the replacement of the 
special auditor were suspended until the completion of the taking of evidence."
"Volkswagen AG had in addition 
previously filed an action before the Braunschweig Regional Court seeking to enjoin the special auditor from per-
forming the audit as long as he had not furnished sufficient proof of his independence."
"The Braunschweig  
Regional Court dismissed the action for injunctive relief in the summer of 2022; Volkswagen AG then appealed 
this decision to the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court."
"A second motion seeking appointment of a special auditor for Volkswagen AG to examine matters relating to

"In late September 2022 the 1st Anti-

objects of declaratory judgment were either dismissed or declared to be irrelevant."
"The legal positions of the 
model case defendants were thus upheld in their entirety."
"Two appeals alleging error of law in the model case 
ruling have been received, one of which is also directed against Volkswagen AG."
"In Brazil, the Brazilian tax authorities commenced tax proceedings against Volkswagen Truck & Bus (formerly: 
MAN Latin America); at issue in these proceedings are the tax consequences of the acquisition structure chosen 
for Volkswagen Truck & Bus in 2009."
"In December 2017, an adverse administrative appeal ruling was rendered 
against Volkswagen Truck & Bus."
Volkswagen Truck & Bus challenged this ruling before the regular court in 2018.
"Estimation of the risk in the event the tax authorities prevail on all points is subject to uncertainty because of 
differences in the amount of penalties and interest that might then apply under Brazilian law."
"However, a positive 
outcome for Volkswagen Truck & Bus remains the expectation."
"Should this not occur, a risk of about BRL 3.4 billion 
could result for the contested period from 2009 onwards; this amount has been included in contingent liabilities 
in the notes."
"In December 2023, the 
Brazilian dealership association Associação Brasileira Dos Distribuidores Volkswagen (Assobrav) and individual 
dealers, among others, filed lawsuits against Volkswagen do Brasil alleging that the dealers were at least partially 
entitled to the refunded amount."
Eight such actions are pending.
"The lawsuit brought by Assobrav with a provi-
sionally estimated amount in dispute of roughly BRL 2.4 billion is by far the largest of these actions."
"In January 
2024, the court dismissed the dealership association’s lawsuit in its entirety."
"Assobrav can appeal the dismissal; 
the judgment is not yet final."
"In 2011, the European Commission conducted searches at European truck manufacturers for suspected  
unlawful exchange of information during the period from 1997 to 2011; in November 2014, the Commission issued 
a statement of objections to MAN, Scania, and the other truck manufacturers concerned."
"In its settlement decision 
of July 2016, the European Commission assessed fines against five European truck manufacturers."
"MAN’s fine 
was waived in full as the company had informed the European Commission about the irregularities as a key wit-
ness."
"In September 2017, the European Commission fined Scania €0.88 billion."
"In a judgment rendered in February 
2022, the European General Court (Court of First Instance) rejected in its entirety the appeal filed by Scania in this 
connection."
"Scania’s April 2022 appeal against this judgment was rejected in full by the European Court of Justice, 
the court of last resort, in February 2024."
"Furthermore, antitrust lawsuits seeking damages have been received 
from customers."
"As is the case in any antitrust proceedings, this may result in further lawsuits for damages."
"No 
provisions have been recognized for a large number of these legal disputes as they are not expected to result in 
final damage awards at the highest appeals level."
"For those actions in which, after re-assessing the risks, the final 
outcome at the highest appeals level appears more likely than not to result in the payment of damages by MAN or 
Scania, provisions have been recognized in an amount of €89 million."
"Contingent liabilities have not been dis-
closed as their quantification is not currently possible."
"This applies in particular to the proceedings that are cur-
rently in an early stage – including those as to which the process of expert assessment is still in an early stage."

AUDI AG, and Dr. Ing."
Porsche AG pursuant to a settlement decision.
"Volkswagen declined to file an appeal, 
hence the decision became final in 2021."
"The manufacturers are not charged with any other misconduct such as price fixing or allocating 
markets and customers."
"Following the European Commission’s July 2021 administrative fine decision, several

A fine equaling just under €3 million was assessed against AUDI AG.
"AUDI AG and Volkswagen

"In the Volkswagen Group, the investigation affects 
Volkswagen Group UK, which was searched by the CMA, and Volkswagen AG, which has received a Group-wide 
information request from the European Commission."
"Also alleged is an agreement to refrain from 
competitive use of ELV issues, that is, not to publicize relevant recycling data (recyclates, recyclability, recovery)

"The violation under investigation is alleged to have taken place in particular in the “ACEA” 
Working Group Recycling and related sub-groups thereof."
"Volkswagen AG is responding to the European Commis-
sion’s information requests."
Volkswagen Group UK is cooperating with the CMA.
"In this matter, CMA furthermore 
issued requests for information to Volkswagen AG."
"In July 2022, Volkswagen AG filed an action for judicial review 
challenging the CMA's requests for information in particular because Volkswagen AG believes that they exceed 
the CMA's jurisdiction."
"In February 2023, the court granted the claim."
"The CMA appealed this judgment in April 
2023, and in January 2024 the appellate court ruled in the CMA’s favor."

"In November 2021, three claimants accompanied by Greenpeace filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen AG before 
the Braunschweig Regional Court."
"The lawsuit further sought to compel Volkswagen to exercise 
influence over Group companies, subsidiaries, and joint ventures so as to cause them to fulfill these demands as 
well."
"In February 2023, the Braunschweig Regional Court dismissed the action as unfounded."
"In addition, another 
action with similar requests for relief and by and large the same rationale has been filed against Volkswagen AG 
by an organic farmer with the support of Greenpeace before the Detmold Regional Court."
"This action was likewise 
dismissed as unfounded by the Detmold Regional Court in February 2023."
"The plaintiffs filed appeals against the 
judgments dismissing their complaints (appeals filed in March 2023 with the Braunschweig Higher Regional Court 
and in April 2023 with the Hamm Higher Regional Court)."
"In Russia, Automobile Plant GAZ LLC (GAZ) had initially filed several judicial proceedings against Volkswagen 
AG and others in the reporting year alleging damage claims totaling around RUB 44 billion."
"In this connection, GAZ 
applied for and in some cases initially obtained protective measures relating to the shares in Volkswagen Group 
Rus OOO (VGR) as well as to the movable and immovable property of VGR; the courts have since either rejected 
or vacated these measures."
"GAZ had appealed these decisions rejecting or vacating protective measures relative 
to the movable and immovable property of VGR; these appeals have since been finally and conclusively rejected."
"In May 2023, Volkswagen AG completed the sale of its shares in VGR and its local subsidiaries to Art-Finance LLC; 
thereby transferring title to the shares in VGR and its local subsidiaries to the buyer upon registration of the trans-
action."
VGR was renamed AGR LLC in June 2023.
"In fulfillment of a court-confirmed settlement, GAZ has since 
withdrawn its complaint in the first lawsuit, thus terminating these proceedings."
"Volkswagen AG continues to

"To this end, the relative share of the fixed remuneration components was reduced and the relative share of the 
long-term variable remuneration was increased."
"Moreover, the option to agree a special bonus with a future effect 
was removed to reinforce the pay-for-performance principle and implement investor demands."
"The maximum 
target achievement values for the annual bonus and the performance share plan and their respective maximum 
payment amounts were also increased in order to adequately reward higher levels of target achievement."
"In this 
process, the maximum remuneration and the cash remuneration cap were likewise raised to accommodate current 
market conditions."
"The Annual General Meeting approved the amended remuneration system on May 10, 2023 
with 98.82% of the votes cast."
A four-year performance period applies to members of the Board of Management.
"Penalty and clawback rules

"Board of Management members appointed before December 14, 2020 and whose service contract has not yet 
been renewed are still subject to a three-year performance period."
"In these cases, penalty and clawback rules will 
likewise only apply on renewal of their contracts."
"The group of beneficiaries of the performance share plan was expanded at the end of 2018 by including mem-

"Performance shares were first granted to members of top management at the 
beginning of 2019."
"All other beneficiaries were allocated benefits on the basis of performance shares for the first 
time at the beginning of 2020."
"The function of the performance share plan for top management and other benefi-
ciaries is largely identical to the performance share plan that was granted to the members of the Board of Man-
agement."
The performance period for beneficiaries below Board of Management level is three years.
Each performance period of the performance share plan has a term of three or four years.
"For members of the 
Board of Management and of top management, the annual target amount under the LTI is converted at the time of 
granting into performance shares on the basis of the initial reference price of Volkswagen’s preferred shares."
"This 
annual target amount is allocated to the respective beneficiaries as a pure calculation position."
"Based on the  
degree of target achievement for the annual earnings per Volkswagen preferred share, the number of performance 
shares is definitively determined on the basis of a three- or four-year, forward-looking performance period."
"After 
the end of the performance period, a cash settlement is made."
"The payment amount corresponds to the number 
of determined performance shares, multiplied by the closing reference price at the end of the period plus a divi-
dend equivalent."
"Target achievement is 
determined on the basis of a three-year performance period with a forward-looking horizon of one year."
"For all

All transactions with related parties are regularly conducted on an arm’s length basis.
Porsche SE held the majority of the voting rights in Volkswagen AG as of the reporting date.
"The creation of 
rights of appointment for the State of Lower Saxony was resolved at the extraordinary General Meeting of 
Volkswagen AG on December 3, 2009."
"This means that Porsche SE cannot elect all shareholder representatives 
to the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG for as long as the State of Lower Saxony holds at least 15% of 
Volkswagen AG’s ordinary shares."
"However, Porsche SE has the power to participate in the operating policy deci-
sions of the Volkswagen Group and is therefore classified as a related party as defined by IAS 24."
"According to a notification dated January 8, 2024, the State of Lower Saxony and Hannoversche Be-
teiligungsgesellschaft Niedersachsen mbH, Hanover, held 20.00% of the voting rights of Volkswagen AG on 
December 31, 2023."
"As mentioned above, the General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on December 3, 2009 also 
resolved that the State of Lower Saxony may appoint two members of the Supervisory Board (right of appointment)."
"Volkswagen AG has also undertaken to indemnify the Einlagensicherungsfonds against any losses 
caused by measures taken by the latter in favor of a bank in which Volkswagen AG holds a majority interest."
"In return, Volkswagen AG 
has undertaken to reimburse Porsche SE for any tax advantages of Porsche Holding Stuttgart GmbH, Porsche 
AG and their legal predecessors and subsidiaries relating to tax assessment periods up to July 31, 2009."
"The claim 
was settled in the fourth quarter of 2023."
"The claim has been audited on the basis of the corresponding 
provisions in the tax clause of the contribution agreement and its merits and amount have been confirmed by 
external auditors."
"Both Volkswagen AG (if 
it had exercised its call option) and Porsche SE (if it had exercised its put option) had undertaken to bear the 
tax burden resulting from the exercise of the options and any subsequent activities in relation to the equity  
investment in Porsche Holding Stuttgart GmbH (e.g."
from recapture taxation on the spin-off in 2007 and/or 2009).
"In this case, too, 
Porsche SE is entitled to assert a claim for payment against Volkswagen AG in the amount of the present value of 
the realizable tax benefits that arise at the level of Volkswagen AG or one of its subsidiaries as a result of such a 
transaction."
Volkswagen AG therefore indemnifies Porsche SE against half of such taxes that the company incurs.
" Additionally, Porsche SE and Porsche AG agreed to allocate any subsequent VAT receivables or liabilities from 
transactions in the period up to December 31, 2009 to the company entitled to the receivable or incurring the 
liability."
" A range of information, conduct and cooperation obligations were agreed by Porsche SE and the Volkswagen 
Group in the contribution agreement."
"As part of the IPO of Porsche AG and the sale of ordinary shares to Porsche SE in fiscal year 2022, Porsche SE and 
Volkswagen AG also entered, among other arrangements, into a “procedural and amendment agreement and

"The latter led to amendments to some provisions, including 
those on appointments to governing bodies of Porsche AG, contained in the Comprehensive Agreement."

IPO of Porsche AG 
On September 28, 2022, Volkswagen placed 25% of the preferred shares (including additional allocations) of its 
subsidiary Porsche AG with investors."
"These preferred shares have been traded on the stock exchange since the 
day after the placement."
"Since the end of the stabilization period on October 11, 2022, the free float of the pre-
ferred shares has been 24.2% of the preferred share capital of Porsche AG."
"The basis for the IPO was a compre-
hensive agreement to enter into a number of contracts between Volkswagen and Porsche SE."
"In this context, the 
two parties agreed that Porsche SE would acquire 25% of the ordinary shares plus one ordinary share of  
Porsche AG from Volkswagen."
"The sale of these ordinary shares in Porsche AG by Porsche SE is subject to re-
strictions until 2027."
"Under the share purchase agreement, Volkswagen AG as warrantor provided several warranties to Porsche SE, 
which essentially put Porsche SE in the same position as buyers of the preferred shares sold under the IPO."
"In 
addition, Volkswagen AG assumes a small number of other standard market guarantees, most of them limited to 
positive knowledge of Volkswagen AG."
"The resolution of the extraordinary General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on December 16, 2022 gave rise to the 
obligation to pay a special dividend and led to a total obligation to the shareholders of Volkswagen AG amounting 
to €9.6 billion as of December 31, 2022."
"Out of the total, an amount of €3.1 billion was attributable to Porsche SE."
"Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE agreed to offset the obligation to pay a special dividend to Porsche SE against 
Volkswagen AG’s claim to the payment of the purchase price still outstanding for the second tranche of ordinary 
shares."
"In the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, the purchase price receivable and the 
dividend liability were therefore presented on a net basis."
"Upon payment of the special dividend on January 9, 
2023, the netting process was completed."
"In connection with the IPO of Porsche AG, Volkswagen AG had also assumed obligations for dividend distribu-
tions of Porsche AG in 2022."
"The corresponding dividend of the same amount was resolved at the Annual General 
Meeting of Porsche AG on June 28, 2023 and paid on July 3, 2023."
"€114 million of this dividend was attributable 
to Porsche SE."
"Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE have agreed in connection with the IPO and sale of ordinary shares to  
Porsche SE that representatives of Porsche SE will have a significant presence on the Supervisory Board of

In addition to the liabilities to associates and their majority interests, there are long-term purchase obligations

The following text is a translation of this auditor’s report.
"In addition, we have audited the group management  
report of VOLKSWAGEN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, which is combined with the Company’s management report, 
for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023."
"In accordance with the German legal requirements, we 
have not audited the content of the parts of the group management report specified in the appendix and the 
company information stated therein that is provided outside of the annual report and is referenced in the group 
management report."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
• 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec."
"In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated  
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the oppor-
tunities and risks of future development."
"We do not express an opinion on the parts of the group man-
agement report listed in the appendix."
"322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the 
legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"Basis for the opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accord-
ance with Sec."
317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No.
"537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Reg-
ulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promul-
gated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities 
under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report” section of our auditor’s report."
"In addition, in accordance with Art."
"10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we 
have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art."
5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.
"We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consoli-
dated financial statements and on the group management report."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023."
"These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters."
"Below, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters: 
1."
The hardware and software measures had largely been completed as of the reporting date.
"The risk 
provisions for the diesel issue mainly include provisions for administrative and civil proceedings."
"Furthermore, 
there are legal risks from other criminal and administrative proceedings as well as civil actions, particularly by 
customers and holders of securities."
"Whether provisions need to be recognized or con-
tingent liabilities disclosed for the legal risks from the diesel issue, and in what amount, depends to a large extent 
on the assessments and assumptions made by the executive directors."
"In light of the significance of the risk provisions and the extent of the assumptions and scope for judgment by 
the executive directors, this matter was a key audit matter."
"We compared confirmations received from external law-
yers with the risk assessment by the executive directors."
"We also regularly reviewed publicly available infor-
mation, such as media reports, to assess the completeness of the provisions and contingent liabilities."
"In addition, we reviewed on a sample basis the input factors (quantity and value) of the provisions and contin-
gent liabilities for individual matters using statements of claims received, settlement agreements and court judg-
ments."
"With regard to the valuation, we also compared the current assessments by the executive directors with 
past experience, where observable."
"For significant additions to provisions, we examined whether they were due 
to new matters or to changes in the estimation inputs and obtained corresponding evidence."
"To analyze significant 
utilizations of the provisions, we obtained an understanding of the procedural controls implemented and examined 
a sample to determine whether they were based on settlement agreements or court judgments and whether cor-
responding payments were made."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting treatment of the risk provisions 
for the diesel issue."
"The recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating units is calculated on the basis of their value in use, applying discounted cash flow models."
"These estimates by 
the executive directors are subject to risk and may be revised in response to changes in environmental regulation 
and market conditions."
"In addition, the executive directors have scope for judgment in determining the cash-generating units for  
impairment testing, in determining the discount rates used and the long-term growth rates assumed."
"In view of the foregoing, the materiality of goodwill and the acquired brand names in relation to total assets, 
the complexity of the valuation and the judgment exercised during valuation, the impairment testing of goodwill 
and the acquired brands was a key audit matter."
"Auditor’s response 
During our audit, we involved valuation specialists to assess among other things the methodology used to perform 
the impairment tests in light of the provisions of IAS 36."
"We also checked the arithmetical accuracy of the valua-
tion models used."
"We analyzed the planning process established in the Volkswagen Group as well as the impairment testing 
process and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls implemented in each process."
"In this context, we

the group planning."
"As a starting point, we compared the Volkswagen Group’s five-year operational plan prepared 
by the executive directors and acknowledged by the Supervisory Board with the forecast figures in the underlying 
impairment tests."
"We discussed the key planning assumptions for selected brands to which significant goodwill 
and acquired brand names are allocated with the executive directors and compared them with past earnings and 
cash inflows to assess the planning accuracy."
"We based plausibility testing of the inputs for the impairment tests 
among other things on a comparison with general and industry-specific market expectations underlying the

"We also investigated the expectations regarding the development of market shares for 
battery electric vehicles, the effects on the planned investments and their indirect effects on the long-term cash

"The complexity of research and development projects is mounting in view 
of the technological transformation of the Volkswagen Group and the resulting new development areas (including 
high investments in electromobility, software and autonomous driving)."
"Assessments of project feasibility are 
playing an ever greater role in this connection and entail the use of considerable judgment."
"Where capitalized development costs are not yet subject to amortization, they must be tested for impairment 
as part of the related cash-generating unit at least annually at the level of the brands defined as cash-generating 
units."
"The assumption of realizing future economic benefits and the result of testing the recoverability of capital-
ized development costs during the analyses and impairment tests performed are highly dependent on the execu-
tive directors’ estimate of future cash flows and which discount rates they use."
"The recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating units is calculated on the basis of their value in use, applying discounted cash flow models."
"Growth expectations 
of the executive directors are subject to risk and may be revised in response to changes in environmental regula-
tion and market conditions."
"In addition, the executive directors have scope for judgment in determining the cash-generating units for  
impairment testing, in determining the discount rates used and the long-term growth rates assumed."
"Auditor’s response 
During our audit, we examined the process for identifying the research and development costs, particularly with 
reference to the criteria for capitalization."
"In this connection, we carried out analytical audit procedures such as 
comparisons of project budgets and capitalization rates, inspected documentation on project feasibility and 
tested process-related controls in some areas."
"We also assessed the future economic benefit criterion for capi-
talization based on the assumptions regarding the cash inflows of the cash-generating unit to which the capital-
ized development work is allocated."
"Moreover, we involved valuation specialists to assess among other things the methodology used to determine 
the relevant cash-generating units and perform the impairment tests in light of the provisions of IAS 36."
"We also 
checked the arithmetical accuracy of the valuation models used."
"We analyzed the planning process established in the Volkswagen Group and tested the operating effectiveness 
of the controls implemented therein."
"As a starting point, we compared the Volkswagen Group’s five-year opera-
tional plan prepared by the executive directors and acknowledged by the Supervisory Board with the forecast 
figures in the underlying impairment tests."
"We discussed with the executive directors the key planning assump-
tions for a sample we selected of brands with significant capitalized development costs and compared them with 
past earnings and cash inflows to assess the planning accuracy."
"We based plausibility testing of the inputs for the 
impairment tests among other things on a comparison with general and industry-specific market expectations 
underlying the expected cash inflows."
"We also investigated the expectations regarding the development of market 
shares for battery electric vehicles, the effects on the planned investments and their indirect effects on the long-

"To assess the discount rates and

"We also assessed the sensitivity analyses performed by the executive directors in order to estimate any poten-
tial impairment risk associated with a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions used in 
the valuation."
"Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the recognition and recoverability of the capitalized 
development costs."

"COMPLETENESS AND MEASUREMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS 
 
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter 
Obligations for warranty claims are calculated on the basis of estimated warranty costs and ex gratia arrange-
ments."
"Where unusual individual technical risks are anticipated, an individual assessment is made whether and, 
if so, to what extent measures are required to remediate them and provisions need to be recognized."
The amount of provisions for warranty claims is significant overall.
"Besides the general use of judgment in 
selecting the valuation methods and assessing the obligations, increasing estimation uncertainty stems from the 
growing proportion of hybrid and battery electric vehicles entering the market and a lack of experience of their 
susceptibility to faults."
"In light of the amount of the provisions and the judgment exercised during valuation, the 
completeness and measurement of provisions for warranty obligations was a key audit matter."
"Auditor’s response 
With regard to the accounting for the provisions for warranty obligations, we examined the underlying processes 
for recording previous claims, calculating and valuing the estimated future warranty costs and recognizing the 
provisions, and tested controls in some areas."
"In light of the uncertainty in relation to the estimated future warranty costs, we assessed the underlying valu-
ation assumptions, especially the expected claim rate per vehicle and the cost thereof, using analyses of historical 
data."
"Where there was a lack of past experience, we obtained an understanding of the assumptions made by the 
executive directors and tested their plausibility using historical data for comparable items."
"Using the calculation 
bases derived from these historical data, we checked the estimated costs for expected claims per vehicle."
"To  
assess the completeness of the provisions, we also reconciled the number of sold vehicles used to recognize the 
provision with the sales volumes."
"We obtained an understanding of the method used for calculating the provisions, 
including the discounting, and reperformed the calculations."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the completeness and valuation of provisions 
for warranty obligations."

"DETERMINATION OF THE EXPECTED RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASE ASSETS DURING IMPAIRMENT TESTING 
 
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter 
The lease assets balance sheet item comprises vehicles under operating leases."
"The recoverability of the lease 
assets depends in particular on the expected residual value of the leased vehicles after expiration of the contrac-
tual term."
The expected residual values are reviewed by the Company on a quarterly basis.
"The forecast residual 
values are adjusted to include constantly updated internal and external information on residual values, depending 
on specific local factors and the experiences gained in the marketing of used cars."
"This requires management to 
make, in particular, assumptions about vehicle supply and demand in the future, as well as about vehicle price 
trends."
Minimal changes in the parameters underlying the valuation can lead to significant variation in values.
"In this 
light, the determination of the expected residual values of assets leased under operating leases during impairment 
testing was a key audit matter."
"Auditor’s response 
During our audit, we analyzed the process implemented by the Company for determining and monitoring the  
residual values to identify any risks of material misstatement and obtained an understanding of the process steps 
and controls."
"On this basis, we tested the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls over the determi-
nation and monitoring of the expected residual values."
"To assess the forecasting models used to determine the 
residual values, we assessed the validation plans on the basis of the respective model designs to determine 
whether the validation procedures described in the plans allow an assessment of the models’ forecast quality."
"We 
investigated whether the validation procedures performed according to the validation plans and the backtesting 
performed led to any indications of model weaknesses or any need to adjust the models."
"Furthermore, we  
assessed whether the assumptions underlying the forecasting model and the inputs used for determining the 
expected residual values were clearly documented."
"To this end, we obtained evidence for the main inputs and 
assumptions used for mileage, age and lifecycle phase of the vehicles to determine the residual values and  
examined them for currentness and transparency."
"We assessed whether the marketing assumptions used reflect 
industry-specific and general market expectations as well as, in particular, current marketing results."
"Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the determination of the expected residual 
values of the assets leased under operating leases during impairment testing."
"Reference to related disclosures 
With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for lease assets, refer to the disclosure on lease 
assets in the “Accounting policies” section of the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"The executive directors describe how they inter-
preted the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder."
"Due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to  
uncertainties."
