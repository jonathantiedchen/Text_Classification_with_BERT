"One of our guiding principles is “Seeing the Big Picture – Taking Action.” The message this 
conveys is that we are masters of our trade."
And we are rising to the challenges associated with it.
"We are 
resolute in the entrepreneurial decisions we make."
"This has allowed us to evolve into Europe’s leading 
residential real estate company over the last few years."
"We are improving the services we offer our tenants, 
increasing customer satisfaction and cutting costs."
We are doing our bit to help solve social issues.
"We 
provide safe homes for well over a million people from across the globe."
"This is a responsibility that we live 
up to."
"Despite the mounting uncertainties in the world around us, our guiding principle remains unchanged."
"We 
once again got down to getting things done last year."
"We took action as opposed to adopting a “wait and 
see” approach."
The intensity of the interest rate turnaround was unusual.
"It marked the most drastic rise in 
interest rates in such a short space of time since the Federal Republic of Germany was established."
Our response to this development has been to exercise capital discipline.
"We adapted our investment 
strategy, launched an ambitious sale program and entered into new joint venture partnerships to take 
considerable pressure off our balance sheet."
"We still have good access to capital in an ongoing difficult 
environment."
"At the beginning of 2024, we placed a significantly oversubscribed bond on the UK financial 
market for the very first time, followed by our first bond in Swiss francs."
"This is testimony to the trust that 
international investors place in us."
Our ratings are also stable at a high level.
"In 2023, we realized real estate sales, including joint venture structures, worth around € 4 billion, doubling 
our original target for the year."
Transactions on this sort of scale are currently a rarity on the market.
"We sold 
apartments at prices close to or above the carrying amount; commercial properties were sold at prices 
slightly below the carrying amount."
"While the adjustments we made to our new construction strategy in response to the high interest rates and 
construction costs were urgently required, we did not decide to stop our construction activities altogether."
"It 
goes without saying that we will complete all of the projects we have already started."
"As a result, 2,425 
residential units were created in 2023."
"We will complete a similar number of apartments this year, too."
"We 
are also continuing to develop new construction projects, but only until the building permit stage for the 
time being."
This is our way of sending out a clear signal: It remains our aim to provide affordable homes.
"We 
want to, and we will, continue to build."
"In order to do so, however, we need policymakers to create reliable 
long-term overall conditions and a stable market environment."
We are also continuing to invest heavily in climate protection.
"Last year saw us invest € 1.5 billion in the 
long-term quality of our residential property as we continue on our climate pathway: By 2045, we will

manage a virtually climate-neutral portfolio."
"This, too, remains an ambitious task in financial, energy tech-
nology and operational terms."
"In 2024 we will be increasing our investment volume and, in particular, 
stepping up our energy-efficient refurbishments."
"We will also be driving ahead with the expansion of photo-
voltaics and the installation of heat pumps."
"One piece of very good news is that we have had Ruth Werhahn on board as our CHRO since October 1, 
2023."
She is a proven expert with a wealth of experience.
"Over the past ten years, our workforce has quadru-
pled."
"They put their talents and skills into practice day after day to serve customers – helping us to live up to 
our most important service promise."
"Our independent HR executive division will help us to further boost our 
appeal as an employer."
"It is supported by a sustained low vacancy rate and 
synergies resulting from the merger with ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen."
"Adjusted EBITDA from our rental activities rose 
to € 2.4 billion, up 6.5% on the previous year despite disposals."
"Adjusted EBITDA Total, including the non-strategic Care business, amounted to € 2.6 billion."
"Accounting for 
92% of our overall business, rental is by far the largest item."
"The Value-add, Development and Recurring 
Sales segments fall short of the previous year’s figures as was to be expected due to market conditions."
Group FFO is down to € 1.8 billion due to interest rate developments.
"We are reporting Group FFO per share 
of € 2.23 for 2023."
This means we have met our forecast for 2023 for all key figures.
"With a vacancy rate of 2.0%, Vonovia’s portfolio of residential properties is virtually fully occupied as of the 
reporting date."
"On the reporting date, our portfolio comprised around 546,000 apartments and had a fair value of € 83.9 
billion."
"The residential real estate portfolio value dropped 6.6% in the first half of 2023 and 4.2% in the 
second half due to the changes in the market environment and disposals."
"On a positive note, however, this 
trend weakened as the year progressed."
"As a result of the development in fair value, the EPRA NTA is 16.6% 
lower than the December 2022 figure at € 38.1 billion."
"The EPRA NTA per share came to € 46.82 on the 
reporting date."
The pro forma loan-to-value ratio LTV amounts to 46.7%.
"The target corridor of 40% to 45% 
remains the relevant reference value."
"Based on this financial development and together with the Supervisory Board, we will be proposing a divi-
dend of € 0.90 per share to you on May 8, 2024."
"This proposal is around 6% higher than the dividend 
for 2022."
"We believe that this strikes a good balance between the ongoing need for cost discipline and 
appropriate participation in our business results."
"It goes without saying that the decision on the dividend lies 
with you, our shareholders."
"We hope, however, that our proposal gives you a clear basis on which to make a 
decision."
"One thing is certain: It will be an interesting year, and one that we have set ambitious targets for."
"As usual, 
we will be passionate in our pursuit of these targets."
"Following the extremely successful sales in the previous 
year, we aim to sell residential property worth € 3 billion in 2024 to stabilize the LTV."
"We will be there for our 
customers, will continue on our climate path and will again invest heavily in our portfolio."
"Going forward, we will be making a clearer distinction in our management system between earnings orienta-
tion and liquidity orientation."
"This is our way of reflecting the current market environment and the resulting 
need to manage our liquidity."
"Taking into account what is currently a much more relevant sale segment, 
Group FFO does not allow us to make a sufficient distinction in this regard."
"While it reflects the earnings 
contributions made by disposals, it does not capture the liquidity inflows they generate in full."
"In this respect, 
Group FFO is a mixture of earnings and cash flow, meaning that it is not a clear performance indicator."
"Going forward, ­
Vonovia will reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted earnings before taxes (Adjusted EBT), 
establishing this as the central measure of earnings."
"EBT is a standard performance indicator for companies; 
as such, it offers high levels of transparency and allows for comparisons to be drawn with other industries."
"Like our existing Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBT is adjusted to reflect effects that do not relate to the 
period, recur irregularly or are atypical for business operation."
"Unlike Group FFO, this Adjusted EBT includes 
depreciation and amortization as a measure of loss in value, but does not include current income taxes, as 
these are not part of operating value creation."
"As the leading indicator of internal financing and, as a result, liquidity management, ­
Vonovia will also be 
reporting its operating free cash flow (OFCF) in the future."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
7
The overall framework will remain challenging."
"Nevertheless, we are also witnessing a number of positive 
trends."
"The latest inflation data, which reached its lowest level in two and a half years in January 2024, 
suggests that the investment climate is starting to brighten up."
"The central banks are signaling stable 
interest rates at the very least, with a chance of initial interest rate hikes."
"The plans we have made are such that we can take action from a position of strength at all times: Our 
unsecured liabilities are already covered in full, taking into account the latest bond issues, until the end of 
the third quarter of 2025."
"For the financial year, we expect an Adjusted EBITDA contribution in the range of € 2.55 billion to € 2.65 bil-
lion, while Adjusted EBT is expected to be in the range of € 1.70 billion to € 1.80 billion."
"From 2024, we will no 
longer manage the Care business held for sale as a segment, and will report it under Development to hold in 
the valuation, but no longer in Adjusted EBITDA."
"Looking ahead to future developments, we will focus more 
on increasing our income again once we know for certain that real estate valuations have bottomed out."
The replacement of Group FFO necessitates a new basis for the dividend from 2024.
"The aim is to ensure a 
solid dividend based on Adjusted EBT and sufficient financing for investments at all times."
"As in previous 
years, shareholders will again have the choice between a cash dividend and a scrip dividend."
"I’d like to finish on a personal note:
Since the beginning of the year, more than one million people in Germany have taken to the streets to 
demonstrate against right-wing extremism."
"These peaceful demonstrations send out a strong signal for our 
democracy and for values that are shared by many countries around the world."
"These are values shared by 
Ruth Werhahn, Arnd Fittkau, Philip Grosse, Daniel Riedl and myself – as the entire ­
Vonovia Management 
Board."
The determination these people have shown is encouraging.
"­
Vonovia is like Germany itself: diverse, tolerant, humanitarian and reliant on immigration."
"Just take the 
example of the Ruhr region: Without immigration, this region could never have established itself as an 
economic powerhouse and brought prosperity to people throughout Germany."
"In this spirit of cohesion and openness, let us address the tasks waiting for us in 2024 with a positive attitude 
– together with my Management Board team, our employees, our business partners and you, our shareholders."
"Bochum, March 2024
Sincerely,
Rolf Buch (CEO)

The Company and Its Shares — Letter from the Management Board

Report of the Supervisory Board
Dear Readers,
Overall conditions on the capital markets have changed 
significantly over the past two years."
"The abrupt turnaround 
in interest rates put the economy – and the real estate 
market along with it – under severe pressure."
"­
Vonovia did 
not escape these developments unscathed either."
"The 
impact was particularly evident in the value adjustments 
that had to be made to the residential property portfolio and 
in the Management Board’s decision to adjust the compa-
ny’s investment policy, particularly with regard to the new 
construction business."
"In a challenging environment, the Management Board 
proposed an appropriate solution for the challenges of 2023."
"Selective portfolio sales and increased cost discipline 
ensured that the Group remains on a stable foundation."
"The 
intact business model, which ­
Vonovia used to provide its 
customers with reliable support once again over the past 
year, remains a key pillar."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, the Supervisory Board continuously 
monitored the Management Board’s management activities 
and provided the Management Board with regular advice 
concerning the running of the company."
"We were able at all 
times to establish that their actions were lawful, expedient 
and regular."
"The Management Board notified us regularly, 
promptly and comprehensively, both in writing and verbally, 
of all circumstances and measures that were relevant to the 
company."
"The Management Board fulfilled its information 
obligations to an appropriate extent at all times."
"At our plenary meetings and in our committees, we always 
had ample opportunity to critically appraise the reports and 
proposals submitted by the Management Board and to 
contribute our own suggestions."
"We discussed and tested 
the plausibility of all business occurrences of significance to 
the company, as communicated to us by the Management 
Board in written and verbal reports, in detail."
"Where required 
by law or the Articles of Association, we granted our con-
sent to individual business transactions."

"**	 
Member of the Supervisory Board since May 17,2023."
"Cooperation Between the Management Board and the 
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board consisted of twelve members in the 
past fiscal year, and ten members as of the end of the 
Annual General Meeting on May 17, 2023."
"We were on hand 
to support the Management Board in the various meetings 
held and also in its key decisions."
"We also kept a close eye 
on the company’s business development outside of meet-
ings."
"The Management Board regularly informed us about 
key events and the company’s strategic direction as part of a 
collaboration based on trust."
"My predecessor Jürgen Fitschen and I, as Chair of the 
Supervisory Board, maintained regular and close dialogue 
with the Chairman of the Management Board in particular, 
but also with the other Management Board members, even 
outside of the Supervisory Board meetings."
"The employee 
representative bodies were involved in communications on 
key company matters via the Management Board."
"The Chairman of the Management Board informed me on 
company-related topics emerging from the Management 
Board’s discussions with representatives of the Group works 
council, going into an appropriate level of detail."
"Other 
members of the Supervisory Board were notified of any 
important findings promptly, or at the latest by the next 
board meeting."
"Last year, we decided to carry out an effectiveness test 
within the Supervisory Board with the involvement of an 
experienced external consultancy firm."
"The evaluation was 
performed at the end of 2023."
"It revealed that our Superviso-
ry Board works efficiently in both its work in plenary ses-
sions and in its committee work."
"In the first quarter of 2024, 
we will address the results of the evaluation again separately 
in order to see how we can implement the recommendations 
for action they include."
"Main Remit
In line with the duties assigned to the Supervisory Board by 
law, the Articles of Association and the rules of procedure, 
we once again closely scrutinized the Group’s operational, 
economic and strategic progress in the 2023 fiscal year."
"The 
main issues covered included the development of overall 
conditions on the markets, changes in the capital market 
environment and their impact on portfolio and new invest-
ments."
"We also discussed the topics of digitalization, 
portfolio strategy and regulation with the Management 
Board in detail."
"Once again, the topic of governance was a key issue for the 
Supervisory Board."
"The regulatory requirements also require 
us to analyze our business activities and the corresponding 
implementation."
"We will be providing close support in this 
matter."
"We also took an in-depth look at the future structure of the 
Supervisory Board and the Management Board."
"As far as the 
Management Board is concerned, we discussed the man-
agement structure, including possible succession arrange-
The Company and Its Shares — Report of the Supervisory Board

ments."
"In 2023, the Supervisory Board was faced with the 
task of (re)appointing candidates for numerous Supervisory 
Board mandates."
"Discussions were held and preparations 
made in this regard as part of the strategic succession 
planning process."
"The Chair of the Supervisory Board is engaged in dialogue 
with the relevant investors on governance issues as part of a 
regular Governance Roadshow, the last of which was held at 
the end of February 2023."
"Meetings
In the 2023 fiscal year, the Supervisory Board met a total of 
seven times to consult and pass resolutions: four times at 
face-to-face meetings (March, May, September, December) 
and three times via conference call (February, August, 
October)."
"The Committee made decisions using a written 
circular in seven cases (February, April, three times in May, 
twice in December)."
"Any individual members absent from the seven meetings 
had always been excused."
"Particularly in the case of the 
extraordinary meetings, these absences were work-related."
"The absent members looked at the meeting documents in 
detail and participated in the decisions made by issuing 
voting instructions to the Chair of the Supervisory Board."
"The attendance rate for Supervisory Board and committee 
meetings averaged 96%."
"No member of the Supervisory 
Board took part in less than half of the meetings during their 
term of office."
"The same applies to participation in commit-
tee meetings."
"In preparation for the meetings, the Manage-
ment Board submitted timely, comprehensive and valid 
written reports and resolution proposals to us."
"Information on the Individual Meetings and Written 
­
Resolutions
On February 28, 2023, the Supervisory Board came together 
at an extraordinary meeting held as a video conference."
"The 
joint venture project with Apollo was the main topic of 
discussion."
"Following a detailed discussion of the key 
economic and legal parameters, we approved the joint 
venture transaction proposed by the Management Board 
and authorized the Management Board to conduct the final 
negotiations and sign the agreement."
"We also discussed 
possible dividend scenarios and took the findings from the 
Governance Roadshow on board."
"We also discussed HR 
matters relating to the Management Board and the Supervi-
sory Board."
"Prior to the discussions on HR matters relating 
to the Management Board, a resolution regarding amend-
ments to the relevant employment contracts had been 
adopted using the written procedure on February 20, 2023."
"On March 16, 2023, we met to adopt the balance sheet."
"We 
approved the company’s annual and consolidated financial 
statements as of December 31, 2022, including the combined 
management report and the Non-financial Declaration."
"We 
also approved the ESG Report, the Remuneration Report and 
the Supervisory Board Report for 2022."
"We approved the proposal for the appropriation of profit to 
be made to the Annual General Meeting as well as the 
proposal that the dividend be paid either in cash or in the 
form of shares."
"Within this context, we transferred the 
corresponding authorities to utilize the authorized capi-
tal 2022 to the Finance Committee."
"We also 
engaged PwC to review the Non-financial Group Declaration 
and ESG reporting, as well as the Sustainability Report for 
the 2023 fiscal year."
"Over and above the Group’s overall performance, we dis-
cussed the operational and economic situation in the 
Development, Value-add and Care segments in particular."
"Other points of discussion included capital market develop-
ments, the joint venture project with the potential partner 
Apollo, and further portfolio disposals."
"One extraordinary topic of discussion was a compliance 
case that led to a search being performed at the corporate 
headquarters on March 6."
"The Management Board ex-
plained that ­
Vonovia was listed as an injured party in the 
investigation proceedings."
"It gave us a detailed account of 
the context and the measures it had taken/initiated."
"The 
Management Board assured us that, based on the informa-
tion currently available, this would not result in any material 
impact on ­
Vonovia’s net assets, financial position and results 
of operations."
"We acknowledged and approved these 
statements."
"We discussed and adopted resolutions on the candi-
dates proposed for election to the Annual General Meeting 
with regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board."
"As 
regards the Management Board, we discussed the establish-
ment of a Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) position 
and a corresponding appointment."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023

We used the written procedure to approve the joint venture 
with the investor Apollo regarding a stake in the ­
Südewo 
portfolio on April 23, 2023."
"On May 3, 2023, we passed 
written resolutions on two contractual provisions with 
members of the Management Board and an adjustment to 
the distribution of duties within the Management Board."
"After the Annual General Meeting, we held our inaugural 
meeting on May 17, 2023."
"At this meeting, Clara-Christina 
Streit was appointed Chair and Vitus Eckert her deputy."
"We 
then passed a resolution to amend the rules of procedure for 
the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, and 
elected the Supervisory Board committees in accordance 
with the new rules of procedure."
"Clara-Christina Streit (as 
Chair), Vitus Eckert and Dr. Ariane Reinhart were elected to 
the Governance and Nomination Committee."
"Dr. Ariane 
Reinhart (as Chair), Jürgen Fenk, Dr. Florian Funck and 
Clara-Christina Streit were elected as members of the HR 
and Remuneration Committee."
"Dr. Florian Funck (as Chair), 
Vitus Eckert, Dr. Ute Geipel-Faber and Matthias Hünlein 
were appointed to the Audit, Risk and Compliance Commit-
tee."
"The Strategy, Finance and Sustainability Committee was 
elected with Jürgen Fenk (as Chair), Dr. Daniela Gerd tom 
Markotten, Hildegard Müller, Clara-Christina Streit and 
Christian Ulbrich."
"We confirmed these resolutions in a video 
conference held on August 3, 2023."
"On September 6 and 7, 2023, we held a two-day meeting to 
discuss the company’s strategy in detail."
"Together with the 
Management Board, we discussed the changes in the overall 
conditions on the capital markets and their impact on 
­
Vonovia in the first part of the meeting."
"The Management 
Board explained the measures taken by the company in 
response to the lower value of the portfolio in order to 
safeguard ­
Vonovia’s financial stability, and presented 
scenarios for future action."
"We encouraged the Manage-
ment Board in its strategic approach, taking into account the 
issues of balance sheet stability, cost discipline and percep-
tion on the capital market (including rating)."
"Further topics of discussion included 
development opportunities for the Value-add and Develop-
ment segments, as well as potential courses of action for the 
companies outside of Germany."
"We also discussed pro-
posals for external consultancy services for the planned 
Supervisory Board effectiveness test."
"The HR and Remuner-
ation Committee reported on the results of the review of the 
remuneration system to ensure compliance with corporate 
governance requirements and check that the remuneration 
components were in line with standard market levels."
"On October 25, 2023, we held an extraordinary video confer-
ence with the Management Board to discuss a further joint 
venture with Apollo and, within this context, the sale of 
shares in a selected portfolio of residential properties."
"We 
authorized the Management Board to finalize the negotia-
tions and conclude the agreements."
"In line with the recommendation put forward by the 
Governance and Nomination Committee, we decided to 
carry out an effectiveness test within the Supervisory Board 
with the support of an experienced external consultancy 
firm."
"We also discussed the topics to be addressed in further 
training sessions for the Supervisory Board and confirmed 
our decision to continue to include specific topics related to 
the residential real estate sector and governance in future 
training."
"We also took advantage of presentations offered by 
management and executives within this context."
"We took a 
detailed look at rent trends, the rent indices and their 
application, as well as the effects of application on business 
development."
"As part of our discussions on HR-related matters, we 
discussed succession planning for the Management Board 
and Supervisory Board."
"The Governance and Nomination 
Committee is supported in this work by an HR consultancy 
firm."
"Based on an evaluation of market mapping exercises 
carried out based on predefined qualifications profiles, we 
compiled a pool of potential candidates to fill any Board 
positions that become vacant."
"These lists of potential 
candidates are being maintained in order to safeguard 
succession planning by the Supervisory Board committees."
"With the help of an experienced remuneration consultant, 
we looked at the remuneration paid to the Management 
Board and found it to be in line with market practice."
"As a 
result, we followed the recommendation made by the HR 
and Remuneration Committee and confirmed the appropri-
ateness of the remuneration paid to the Management Board

members."
"This involved discussing whether an individual 
performance criterion should be agreed with the members 
of the Management Board for the purposes of their variable 
remuneration (short-term incentive)."
"We also endorsed the recommendation made by the Gover-
nance and Nomination Committee to issue an updated 
Declaration of Conformity."
"The second part of the Supervisory Board meeting held on 
December 6, 2023 focused on the Management Board’s 
budget and medium-term planning."
"The Management Board 
provided us with information on current economic develop-
ments and explained its key planning assumptions for 2024 
and beyond."
"The Management Board also addressed devel-
opment opportunities for the Development segment within 
this context."
"We approved the 2024 budget presented and 
acknowledged the five-year plan presented by the Manage-
ment Board."
"On December 18, 2023, we used the written procedure to 
approve the target values for the Sustainability Performance 
Index (SPI) as part of the 2024 budget."
"Also on December 18, 2023, we used the written procedure 
to adopt the agreement of an individual target with the 
members of the Management Board as part of their variable 
remuneration."
"The individual contributions to be made by 
the members of the Management Board are to be defined in 
the first quarter of 2024."
"Committees and Their Work
We have established committees within the Supervisory 
Board in order to perform our duties effectively."
"The com-
mittees prepare subjects which are to be discussed and/or 
resolved by the Supervisory Board."
"In addition, they pass 
further resolutions that we have delegated to them instead 
of passing them on the Supervisory Board as a whole."
"Up until the Annual General Meeting held on May 17, 2023, 
our work was supported by three committees: the Audit 
Committee, the Finance Committee and the Executive and 
Nomination Committee."
"At the inaugural meeting on May 17, 2023, we split tasks and 
key topics among four committees."
"The Executive and 
Nomination Committee was abolished and two new com-
mittees formed, a Governance and Nomination Committee 
and an HR and Remuneration Committee."
"Duties were 
reassigned and additional duties were entrusted to the 
committees."
"> Governance and Nomination Committee: This committee 
holds regular discussions on long-term succession plan-
ning for the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as 
well as the company’s corporate governance."
"It also advises the Management Board on 
issues related to the digitalization of society, including the 
topics of technological innovation and transformation."
"It also advises 
the Management Board on matters related to HR strategy 
(including employer branding, human capital development, 
performance management, remuneration) and restructur-
ing measures."
"Details on the establishment of the committees and their 
tasks were included in the rules of procedure for the Super-
visory Board and are explained in the corporate governance 
declaration."
"The Audit Committee, and later the Audit, Risk and Compli-
ance Committee, maintained close contact with the auditors 
of the financial statements at the quarterly meetings."
"The 
Committee, represented by the Chair, and the auditors also 
maintained close dialogue in the run-up to the quarterly 
Audit Committee meetings."
"Audit Committee (until May 17, 2023)
The Audit Committee had four members up until the 2023 
Annual General Meeting."
"The Chairman was Prof. Dr. Edgar 
Ernst."
"The other members were Vitus Eckert, Jürgen Fenk and

"Jürgen Fitschen and Clara-Christina Streit

Fundamental Understanding
In order for a company to be successful, its business model 
has to be accepted by all relevant stakeholder groups, from 
its customers through to civil society and the public, inves-
tors or business partners."
"Managing with integrity, the 
sustainability of business models and the extent to which a 
company is perceived as living up to its social responsibili-
ties are playing an increasingly important role."
"This applies 
no less to the real estate sector."

result in the corporate governance regulations being tight-
ened up, as was the case with the Financial Market Integrity 
Strengthening Act (FISG)."
"Among other measures, the 
obligation to establish an appropriate and effective internal 
control system (ICS) as well as a corresponding risk man-
agement system (RMS) for listed stock corporations was 
introduced in a quest to strengthen trust in the German 
financial market."

as the responsible management and supervision of a com-
pany."
"The Management Board and the Supervisory Board 
have made a comprehensive commitment to the principles 
of corporate governance as set out in the German Corporate 
Governance Code."
"Standards of Corporate Governance
These principles are the basis for the sustainable success of 
the company and therefore serve as guidelines for conduct 
in the company’s daily management and business."

corporate governance strengthens the trust of our share-
holders, business associates, customers, employees and the

"Information on the Company’s Governing Constitution
The designation ­
Vonovia comprises ­
Vonovia SE and its 
Group companies."
"­
Vonovia is a European company (SE) in 
accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), 
the SE Act and the SE Regulation."
"Its registered headquar-
ters are in Bochum."
"It has three governing bodies: the 
Annual General Meeting, the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board."
"The duties and authority of those 
bodies derive from the SE Regulation (SE-VO), the German 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the Articles of Associa-
tion."
"Shareholders, as the owners of the company, exercise 
their rights at the Annual General Meeting."
"According to the two-tier governance system, ­
Vonovia SE 
has a Management Board and a Supervisory Board."
"In the 
two-tier governance system, the management of business 
and the monitoring of business are strictly separated from 
each other, meaning that individuals cannot be members of 
both bodies at the same time."
"The duties and responsibili-
ties of the bodies are clearly specified by law in the German 
Stock Corporation Act."
"In accordance with the governing 
laws, in particular the SE Regulation and the German SE 
Employee Participation Act (SEBG), the Supervisory Board is 
only made up of representatives of the shareholders."

highest representative body of the employees is the Group 
works council."

level of ­
Vonovia SE."

affected are also required to state which of the recommen-
dations of the Code have not been, or will not be, applied 
and, if not, why."
"The most recent Declaration of Conformity 
is valid for at least the next five years and the Declarations 
of Conformity that are no longer valid can be found on the 
company’s website."
"If the auditor finds the Declaration of 
Conformity to be incorrect, the Supervisory Board is in-
formed and this is also noted in the audit report."
"The Management Board reports in its declaration, also on 
behalf of the Supervisory Board, on important aspects of 
corporate governance pursuant to Section 289f of the 
German Commercial Code (HGB) and Principle 23 of the 
German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) 2022."
"G.13 sentence 2 of the Code specifies that, if post-­
contractual non-compete clauses apply, the severance 
payments shall be taken into account in the calculation of 
any compensation payments."
"This recommendation has not 
yet been implemented in one particular case for reasons 
relating to vested rights."
"The recommendation set out in G.13 
sentence 2 of the Code will be applied to contract extensions 
and to any contracts concluded in the future."

General Meeting as a virtual event."

Vonovia still considers 
this to be a very successful concept."

> Results down in the other segments.
"> Investments adjusted to reflect changes in return 
requirements and, as a result, capital allocation."
"In an environment dominated by difficult overall conditions, ­
Vonovia can look back on a 2023 fiscal year characterized by a 
robust core Rental business."
"The property management business showed positive economic development, bolstered in 
particular by sustained high demand and rising rents, as well as synergies realized from the cooperation with ­
Deutsche 
­
Wohnen."
The environment of higher interest rates and inflation translated into lower results in the other segments.
"Due to two successful joint ventures and extensive sales, liquidity was gained to strengthen the capital structure ."
"The 
changes in return requirements – both internally and externally – are having an impact on capital allocation and, as a result, 
on investments."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, a total of 2,425 apartments were completed in the Development segment."
"The Adjusted EBITDA Total from continuing operations came to € 2,583.8 million, down slightly against the prior-year figure 
of € 2,606.1 million."
"The increase in Adjusted EBITDA Rental almost compensated for the downward trend in the other 
segments despite the sales made."
"At € 1,801.6 million, the Group FFO from continuing operations was 9.1% below the previous year’s figure of € 1,981.6 million."
mainly due to higher interest rates.
"The EPRA NTA per share came in at € 46.82, down by 18.5% on the prior-year value of € 57.48."
The Sustainability Performance Index stood at 111% in the 2023 fiscal year.
"This was helped along in particular by the reduc-
tion of CO2 intensity, the development of the average primary energy requirements of new construction and (partial) mod-
ernization measures to make apartments fully accessible, as well as by the high levels of employee satisfaction."

over the course of the year."
"This means that ­
Vonovia’s 
performance in 2023 was significantly above average."
"Overall, there was once again a strong correlation in the 
fiscal year under review between ­
Vonovia’s share price on 
the one hand, and the capital market’s assessment of future 
interest rate trends and government bond yields on the 
other hand."
"Despite the positive share price performance in 2023, capital 
market assessments continue to be subdued, while develop-
ment on the residential real estate market remains robust."
"While the capital market is pricing real estate stocks at hefty 
discounts, the residential property markets in which we 
operate are relatively robust, with initial signs emerging that 
prices are starting to stabilize."
"This is due, in particular, to 
the favorable relationship, from an owner’s point of view, 
between supply and demand in urban regions, which have 
conventionally been long-term financing arrangements, tax 
aspects as well as the structural momentum on the revenue 
side."
"We continue to believe that shares in ­
Vonovia can reflect the 
positive operating development and ultimately the success 
of our business model as a whole in the medium to long 
term."
"Our responses to key long-term megatrends – climate 
change, urbanization and demographic change – remain the 
dominant factors driving our business."
"We are optimistic as 
we look ahead to the future and are confident that we will 
remain financially successful."
"The average daily trading volume for shares in ­
­
Vonovia SE,

"Expressed in euros, shares in ­
Vonovia 
worth € 77.3 million were traded every day on average 
in 2023, down slightly on the previous year."
"­
Vonovia’s shares reached their highest daily closing price for 
the year on December 28, 2023, at € 28.85 and their lowest 
daily closing price on March 28, 2023, at € 15.66."

"Financing Environment
In 2023, the capital markets were hit by increasing volatility, 
changes in the interest rate environment and further geopo-
litical events and uncertainties."
"Market participants were 
forced to face these key challenges and refocus."
"Central banks across the globe responded to historically high 
inflation witnessed in 2022 and 2023 by raising interest rates, 
putting an end to their loose monetary policy."
"After many 
years with interest rates close to 0%, the key rate hikes are 
affecting the capital markets."
"Interest rates have multiplied 
within a short space of time."
"Starting in July 2022, the European Central Bank (ECB) 
implemented ten consecutive key interest rate hikes to 4.5% 
– the highest level seen since the start of monetary union 
back in 1999."
"In October, the ECB left interest rates in the 
eurozone unchanged for the first time."
"The ECB then went on 
to leave interest rates in the eurozone unchanged for the 
second time running in December."
"Yields on ten-year German government bonds, which had 
been in negative territory for years, reached a level just 
under the 3% mark for the first time at the beginning of 
October."
"They then made a strong recovery at the end of the 
year and came in at 2.029% at the end of December."
"The ECB also gradually tapered its asset purchases starting 
in March 2023."
"Since July 2023, funds from maturing securi-
ties as part of its Asset Purchasing Program (APP), intro-
duced back in 2015 with a volume running into the trillions, 
have no longer been reinvested."
"The US Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the key interest rate 
eleven times in a row since March 2022."
"In December 2023, 
the FED left its key rate unchanged for the third time in a 
row."
It ranges from 5.25% to 5.50%.
"The UK central bank, the Bank of England (BoE), also took a 
break for the first time in September 2023 after implement-
The Company and Its Shares — ­Vonovia S E on the Cap ital Marke

ing 14 interest rate hikes in a row, starting at the end of 2022, 
leaving its key rate at 5.25%."
"This took the UK key rate to the 
highest level seen in 15 years."
"In December, the BoE kept 
interest rates steady for the third time running."

"Capital Markets Outlook
As inflation stabilizes, interest rates are also starting to

"This should have a positive impact on the capital 
market and our sector in 2024."
"Experts believe that the Federal Reserve could cut key rates 
for the first time as of the second quarter of 2024."
"Econo-
mists predict a total of three rate cuts of 25 basis points 
each in the course of 2024."
"The direction in which the US 
economy develops will also depend on the outcome of the 
presidential elections in November 2024."
"The ECB is also not expected to cut key rates in the eurozone 
until the second half of 2024 at the earliest following the 
recent marked slowdown in inflation."

"The gap between demand for, 
and the supply of, housing has widened further, with socio-
logical and demographic factors having a particular impact 
on housing demand."
"This means that up to 400,000 new 
residential units will have to be built every year over the 
next 20 years to meet demand."
"Although this is also what 
policymakers are striving to achieve, the number of comple-
tions is likely to remain well below the target figure in the 
coming years, as it did in 2023 with a figure of around 
242,000 apartments."
"As a result, the current completion 
level will only exacerbate the shortage of housing, meaning 
that upward pressure on rents will persist."
"The supply side has been confronted with an ongoing rise in 
construction costs over the last few years."
"Driven by the 
uptick in general inflation over the past two years to as much 
as 8.8%, i.e., beyond the level of around 6% witnessed back 
in the early 1990s in the wake of German reunification, the 
construction cost index rose from a baseline of 100 in 2015 to 
around 160 in 2023."
"The increase in construction costs was 
also exacerbated by increasing regulation, with political 
uncertainty and bureaucratic obstacles also hindering faster 
implementation of investment projects."
"The higher construction costs are compounded by the rise in 
interest rates."
"Coming in at over 3% in 2023, the 10-year 
swap rate had risen to a level last seen around twelve years 
ago."
"Upward trends in interest rates and inflation, macroeco-
nomic volatility and less reliable supply chains led to in-
creased costs of capital and therefore higher yield require-
ments, with an additional dampening effect on investment 
behavior."
"This led to mounting pressure on property values, 
significantly restricting transaction activity on the real estate 
market, although ­
Vonovia was largely able to buck this 
trend."
"These overall conditions triggered increased pressure on 
profitability and fair values in the real estate sector, with 
increased capital discipline the only feasible response."
"­
Vonovia strengthened its internal financing power, exercised 
cost discipline and made changes to its investment ap-
proach."
"At the same time, it did not pursue any further 
acquisitions and offered housing stocks for sale or inclusion 
in joint venture structures."
"The capital market response to these measures has proved 
to be encouragingly positive, allowing us to secure our 
investment grade rating while also fueling a visible recovery 
in our share price in the last few months of 2023."
"The merger with the ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen Group was complet-
ed successfully in 2023 and the planned synergy potential 
was realized by making joint use of the management and 
development platform and leveraging harmonization effects 
and economies of scale together."
"The principles of good 
corporate governance are being upheld within this context 
with a view to the ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen Group’s independent 
status."
"This is also ensured by corresponding contractual 
agreements."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023

The business model is rounded off by the housing-related 
services we offer."
"The focus here is on offering cable TV, 
energy supply services for electricity and heating, as well as 
automated meter reading."
"This business model is based on a highly digitalized man-
agement platform and a similarly highly digitalized develop-
ment platform  allowing all stages in the value chain to be 
managed."
"These two platforms are the two most important 
intangible assets within the business model."
"Another 
intangible asset is customer loyalty, fostered through the 
Value-add business."
"The aim is to make the business model future-fit in the long 
run by using sustainable new construction and refurbish-
ment approaches and CO2 reduction in the real estate 
portfolio through innovations to contribute to solutions for 
the current climate protection objectives."
"The concept of the neighborhood 
remains an overarching principle."
"Around 75% of the real estate portfolio is located in contigu-
ous urban quarters, i.e., neighborhoods that generally 
include more than 150 apartments."
"Designing homes that 
offer real quality of life always involves identifying what the 
relevant social structures need, taking into account the 
history of these neighborhoods."
"Neighborhoods are a key 
implementation level for the initiatives aimed at climate 
protection."
"The development business is also consistent 
with the sustainable neighborhood concept."
"This means that ­
Vonovia’s business model makes a positive 
contribution to the pressing socio-political challenges of 
housing shortages and climate protection."
"­
Vonovia aims to be an attractive employer for its employees, 
ensuring equal opportunities and supporting staff members 
in their personal and professional development."
"­
Vonovia manages a housing stock of around 485,000 of its 
own apartments in almost all of Germany’s attractive cities 
and regions."
"It also manages a portfolio of around 40,000 
units in Sweden and approximately 21,000 in Austria."
"The Company
­
Vonovia’s business model is based on the provision and 
rental of good-quality and, most importantly, affordable 
living space at the right time, as well as the management of 
these properties."
"Responsibility towards tenants and

that meets people’s needs and

ment."

ment for our diverse workforce."

parties."

The total fair value comes to around € 83.9 billion, with net 
assets based on the EPRA definition coming to approximate-
ly € 38.1 billion (European Public Real Estate Association: 
EPRA)."
"In addition to its own apartments, ­
Vonovia manages 
around 71,400 apartments for third parties."
"This makes 
­
Vonovia one of the leading residential real estate companies 
in Germany, Austria and Sweden, albeit with a low market 
share of around 2.0% in Germany due to the highly frag-
mented nature of the market."
"­
Vonovia’s roots and those of its predecessor companies 
extend back into the 19th century and lie in not-for-profit 
housing and housing for factory workers."
"This applies to 
Germany, and also to Austria and Sweden."
"Consequently, 
today’s strategic direction is consistent with the company’s 
roots."
"Even back then, the aim was to provide good-quality, mod-
ern and affordable homes, in some cases using innovative 
concepts."
"Many of the housing developments and neighbor-
hoods built in that era were model projects of the time and 
are now covered by preservation orders."
"Living in what were known as “workers’ settlements” was 
about much more than just affordable living space."
"It was 
also about living in a social network with one’s colleagues 
and their families."
"The approximately 780 neighborhoods 
(including ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen) that the company has today 
are one of ­
Vonovia’s USPs and a focal point of the answers 
to the megatrends facing us."
"Via the non-profit company GEHAG, which was established 
in 1924, the Group has properties that are exceptional 
examples of architectural history from the Bauhaus and 
expressionist movements."
"These included new housing 
concepts that helped to shape the idea of a neighborhood 
and were even listed as UNESCO world heritage sites."
"Examples include the “Hufeisensiedlung”, “Wohnstadt Carl 
Legien”, “Weiße Stadt” and “Ringsiedlung Siemensstadt” 
developments."
"The real estate development business and the property 
management business in Austria operate under the estab-
lished BUWOG name."
"In Sweden, ­
Vonovia operates under

"Corporate Structure
­
Vonovia SE, the parent company of the ­
Vonovia Group, is 
organized in the legal form of a dualistic European company 
(SE)."
"­
Vonovia SE is directed by a Management Board, which 
is responsible for conducting business and defining the 
Group’s strategy."
"The strategy is implemented in close 
coordination with the Supervisory Board, which is regularly 
briefed by the Management Board regarding the develop-
ment of business, strategy and potential opportunities and 
risks."
"The Supervisory Board oversees the activities of the 
Management Board."
"­
Vonovia SE has its registered headquarters in Germany."
"Sine 2017, its registered office is located in Bochum."
"The 
head office (principal place of business) is located at Univer-
sitätsstraße 133, 44803 Bochum."
"As of December 31, 2023, 631 legal entities/companies (of 
which 426 in Germany) formed part of the ­
Vonovia Group."
"A 
detailed list of ­
Vonovia SE shareholdings is appended to the 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"­
Vonovia SE performs the function of the management 
holding company for the Group."
"In this role, it is responsible 
for determining and pursuing the overall strategy and 
implementing the company’s goals."
"It also performs over­
arching property management, financing, service and 
coordination tasks for the Group."
"Furthermore, it is responsi-
ble for the management, control and monitoring system as 
well as the risk management system of the Group."
"There is 
also a central function responsible for sustainability issues 
within ­
Vonovia SE; it coordinates these matters for the 
Group as a whole."
"In order to carry out management functions, ­
Vonovia SE has 
established a series of service companies, particularly for 
commercial and operational support functions, which are 
centralized in shared service centers."
"By pooling the corpo-
rate functions on a uniform management and development 
platform, ­
Vonovia achieves harmonization, standardization 
and economies of scale objectives, and the other Group 
companies thus do not need to perform such functions 
themselves."
"This bundling is a prerequisite for the efficient and effective 
management of a portfolio of more than 545,000 apart-
ments and the successful implementation of real estate 
development projects."
"The platforms also serve as the basis 
for the successful digitalization of the process chains."
"This plays a key 
role in ensuring that our customers feel that they have good 
support in their environment."
"In addition, ­
Vonovia will be using new construction and 
development measures, densification and vertical expansion 
to build new apartments in order to meet the rising demand 
for living space in metropolitan areas in particular."
"The 
development organization operating under the BUWOG 
name gives ­
Vonovia extensive product and process exper-
tise in the field of construction and in the development of 
residential construction projects."
"This means that ­
Vonovia 
has not only a management platform but also an end-to-end 
development platform spanning the entire value chain."
"The 
development business is largely managed via project com-
panies."
"The management of the operating business is based on the 
company’s strategic approaches and is conducted via the 
four segments: Rental, Value-add, Recurring Sales and 
Development."
"The overall condi-
tions have changed since the IPO, which has implications for 
corporate management."
"Whereas only a few years back, the shareholder value 
perspective was the main focus, nowadays, a company’s 
actions have to focus on all of its stakeholders."
"All corporate 
stakeholders have had to deal with significant changes in the 
recent past."
"Explicit examples of such stakeholder groups 
include tenants/customers, employees, banks, investors, 
suppliers, as well as society at large and our natural environ-
ment."
"­
Vonovia has an organizational unit reporting to the CEO to 
analyze, coordinate and drive the company’s strategy and, as 
a result, explicitly sustainability aspects in the context of the 
strategy and the business model, on an ongoing basis."
"A 
steering group, the Sustainability Committee, has also been 
set up."
"It includes the entire Management Board as well as 
the individuals responsible for strategy & sustainability, 
corporate communications, investor relations, controlling, 
accounting and business innovation."
"In order to calibrate its sustainability endeavors correctly, 
­
Vonovia conducts a regular materiality analysis or reviews 
this analysis to define areas for action and develop a sus-
tainability roadmap based on the results."
"The materiality 
analysis is currently being reviewed in light of the require-
ments of the CSRD Directive."
"The megatrends of demographic change, urbanization/
shortage of housing, and climate protection/sustainability 
remain the basic framework underpinning the strategy."
"In view of the challenging conditions for the residential real 
estate sector since the start of 2022, the Management Board 
has broken down the strategy and its pillars into key value 
drivers."
"This has not resulted in any changes to our mission 
statement."
"People remain at the center of everything we do, 
and we are committed to living up to this responsibility."
"Decisions are always made looking at the overall context of 
customer centricity, employee satisfaction and sustainability 
with a view to the future."

ness units with 24 regional business areas and 90 regions."
"This system is directly associated with a clear reduction in 
fixed costs and, at the same time, ensures consistent service 
quality to guarantee customer satisfaction."
"Further advances in digitalization will also open up addition-
al efficiency potential in the future, both with regard to 
processes and in the use of building master data and dy-
namic building data."
"The “digital twin” allows buildings to be 
broken down and mapped in digital form for further use 
throughout the company."
"The range of further processing options for digital building 
data includes enhanced service for customers, tailored 
descriptions of sustainable investment measures and 
predictive maintenance, particularly for heating units and 
elevators."
"The primary objective of strengthening the company’s 
internal financing provides the basis for investments to 
address the challenges arising from the megatrends."
"Main-
taining an investment grade rating remains a key objective."
"The company opts for debt or equity financing depending on 
the opportunities that arise under the prevailing equity or 
debt capital market conditions."
"All of these investments have to take account of the new 
return criteria."
"(4)	The value-add business gives ­
Vonovia the expertise to 
perform technical construction services, modernization 
measures and residential environment services."
"­
Vonovia 
uses standardized processes to ensure availability while 
maintaining a consistently high level of quality throughout 
the Group."
"The Value-add business, our “neighborhood workshop,” 
generates added value for the company by bundling 
multi-utility services."
"The aim of the neighborhood work-
shop is to create an integrated system of housing-related 
infrastructure services."
"Further innovations are in the 
development stages and will be offered once they have been 
reviewed for their marketability."
"(5)	The Development business is aimed directly at alleviat-
ing the shortage of housing through the targeted expansion 
of the company’s own portfolio, as well as the direct genera-
tion of income from business with third parties."
"The Development business is also geared towards 
the concept of the neighborhood and sustainability aspects."
"Efficient project implementation based on the development 
platform along the entire value chain guarantees the value 
contribution made by the Development business."
"The value 
chain ranges from the acquisition of land to build on to 
project development, planning, realization and marketing."
"The Development business also has to consider greater 
obstacles to returns and the challenges of efficient capital 
commitment."
"The Development business is managed from five locations in 
Germany, from Vienna, Austria, and Malmö, Sweden."
(6)	Another key value driver is efficient capital allocation.
"Decisions on the 
actual capital allocation are made based on the return and 
­
Vonovia’s internal financing power."
"In the period following the IPO, capital allocation focused on 
external growth through acquisitions and economies of scale 
given the favorable prevailing capital market conditions."
"Due to the current capital market conditions, which are 
dominated by inflation and rising interest rates, as well as 
the resulting higher cost of capital, ­
Vonovia is in the process 
of streamlining its portfolio through sales and the establish-
ment of joint venture structures."
"The aim is to create an 
optimized capital structure and sustainable internal financ-
ing."
"The next phase will be characterized by dynamic portfolio 
management."
"What is more, each business activity will have 
to generate adequate returns and cash surpluses in the 
interests of efficient capital allocation."
"In the Group reporting, the nursing care activities are shown 
as discontinued/abandoned operations."
"It 
has its legal basis in Sections 315b, 315c in conjunction with 
Section 289c to 289e HGB."
"Explanatory 
information on the provisions of the delegated act for 
Regulation (EU) 2020/852, subject to application of Articles 
8 and 10 (EU taxonomy), is provided in the 
 EU Taxonomy 
Regulation section of this Non-financial Group Declaration."
"The integrated approach taken by the Non-financial Group 
Declaration reflects our understanding of sustainability, 
which is also a key component of our corporate strategy and 
business processes."
"Consequently, information on sustain-
ability is not limited to the Non-financial Group Declaration, 
but can be found throughout this annual report, such as in 
the description of our business model, in the risk assess-
ment or in our corporate governance structure."
"Correspond-
ing references point to chapters in the management report 
in which the required disclosures are reported."
"As such, we 
are underscoring our understanding of a sustainable busi-
ness model in which all three dimensions of sustainability 
(ESG) are embedded within our sustainability strategy (see
 Fundamental Information About the Group)."
"The merger with ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen SE (hereinafter referred 
to as ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen) had been completed by the 
beginning of the 2023 fiscal year."
"Since this date, ­
Vonovia 
and ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen have been operating using joint 
systems and structures (see
 Fundamental Information About the 
Group)."
"­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen is therefore fully included in the 
consolidated financial statements and the Non-financial 
Group Declaration of ­
Vonovia."
"­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen will not be 
issuing its own non-financial declaration for the 2023 fiscal 
year, as it is exercising its rights under the simplifying 
provision for CSR reporting pursuant to Sections 289b (2) 
and 315b (2) HGB."
"The company’s activities in Austria and Sweden are also 
covered by this Non-financial Group Declaration."
"This 
includes a full qualitative presentation of the non-financial 
information of the business entities."
"Due to the ongoing 
integration of the corresponding processes, the Group-wide 
consolidation of a few of the key performance indicators is 
still in the implementation phase."
"With respect to each key 
performance indicator, we make reference to the degree of 
KPI integration."
"One exception is the independent Care segment, which was 
integrated into the Group as a whole by the ­
Deutsche 
­
Wohnen subgroup."
"This segment was classified as a discon-
tinued operation at the end of 2023 as a result of a strategic 
review (see 
 Management System)."
"We provide content on 
this segment as part of the corresponding material topic 
(see Social Issues: Homes That Meet People’s Needs and 
Demographic Change)."
"The key figures presented in this 
Non-financial Group Declaration are largely collected and 
presented excluding the Care segment."
"This is based on 
materiality aspects (particularly with regard to the environ-
ment), processes that are not consistently established and 
definitions of key figures with a focus on the real estate 
sector."
"The presentation of the key figures in the context of 
the EU Taxonomy Regulation matches the disclosures in the 
Notes."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023

The main relevant non-financial performance indicators are 
reported – together with information on the underlying 
concepts and objectives – in the individual chapters covering 
the content in question."
"These are allocated to the legally 
mandated aspects – environmental issues, social issues, 
employee issues, combating corruption and bribery, and 
observance of human rights."
"Six of the key figures listed in the Non-financial Group 
Declaration are non-financial performance indicators within 
the meaning of GAS 20, Paragraph 101 in conjunction with 
Paragraph 106."
"These are the key figures that together 
constitute the Sustainability Performance Index (SPI) since 
its introduction in 2021."
"The SPI, which is derived from the 
material sustainability topics, is a vital instrument in terms 
of managing, and in terms of the remuneration for, our 
sustainable activities."
"The SPI represents the leading non-­
financial performance indicator for the ­
Vonovia Group (see 
 Management System)."
"> On our Group website (
 www.­
vonovia.com), which was 
revamped in the reporting year, you can find further 
information on our sustainability strategy and topics – 
such as commitments and guidelines – as well as exam-
ples of implementation."
"> The final aspect of sustainability reporting is participation 
in numerous ESG ratings."
"The Non-financial Group Declaration is subjected to a 
separate limited assurance
 audit conducted by PwC GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Essen, in accordance with 
ISAE 3000."
"All references to content outside the Non-­
financial Group Declaration are further information and are 
not covered by the audit performed by the auditor of the 
annual financial statements."
"An exception to this rule applies 
to references to further chapters of the management report."
These are covered by the audit.

Our Understanding of Sustainability
Our business model – the development and rental of 
high-quality, modern and affordable living space – means 
that our relationship with social and environmental change 
processes is one of great interdependence."
"Sustainability is 
thus a key component of our corporate strategy."
"In recent 
years, we have made great progress in integrating sustain-
ability into the company’s business processes."
"­
Vonovia’s 
understanding of sustainability is published on our Group 
website."
"With the launch of the  non-financial performance indicator 
SPI in 2021, the strategy is linked to clear and remuneration-­
relevant targets for the Management Board and senior 
management (the first tier below the Management Board)."
"The SPI comprises six sub-indicators based on the material 
topics of ­
Vonovia."
"For a more 
detailed description of our sustainable business model, 
please refer to the chapter entitled Fundamental Information 
About the Group."
"In terms of the direction of its sustainability strategy, 
­
Vonovia is also guided by international standards and 
frameworks, such as the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), the UN Global Compact and the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights."
"As a 
company with international operations, we aim to contribute 
to achieving these goals with our business in Germany, 
Austria and Sweden."

Sustainability Organization
At ­
Vonovia, sustainability lies at the very top level of man-
agement."
"The individual responsible for the issue of sustain-
ability is the Chief Executive Officer."
"On the part of the 
Supervisory Board, the Strategy, Finance and Sustainability 
Committee, as well as the Audit Committee (for reporting) 
perform the corresponding control function."
"Central coordination of sustainability activities is the respon-
sibility of the Sustainability/Strategy department."
"Its core 
duties include, in particular, the further development of the 
sustainability strategy, the definition and monitoring of 
sustainability targets, the providing of impetus and the 
implementation of sustainability projects."
"A sustainability committee meets three to four times a year 
– as required – to discuss the overall strategic direction and 
to evaluate the company’s sustainability performance."
"The 
committee comprises the entire Management Board as well 
as the heads of Sustainability, Corporate Communications, 
Controlling, Accounting and Investor Relations."
"This ensures 
that decisions on the implementation of our sustainability 
strategy are borne by all relevant divisions and all the way 
through to local implementation levels."
"The operational implementation of sustainability aspects 
takes place in all relevant departments and in our local 
neighborhoods in the various regions."
"In Austria and Sweden, sustainability coordination is embed-
ded in the relevant staff positions."
"They coordinate the 
interaction between the Sustainability/Strategy department 
and the individual countries, as well as the country-specific 
sustainability strategies pursued by the Austrian BUWOG 
companies and the Swedish company Victoriahem."

Risk Assessment Based on Sustainability As-
pects
The analysis and assessment of risks, taking into account 
sustainability considerations, have become a key component 
of risk management for ­
Vonovia."
"We not only analyze the 
risks in relation to business operations (outside-in perspec-
tive), but also in relation to the possible impacts on the 
environment and society (inside-out perspective)."
"We 
provide information on these risks in our 
 Risks and Opportu-
nities report."
"On the basis of the risk analyses performed and in 
the opinion of ­
Vonovia’s management, there are no non-­
financial risks subject to a reporting requirement that meet 
the materiality criteria pursuant to Section 289c (3) Nos."
"3 
and 4 HGB following application of the net method and 
taking risk mitigation measures into consideration."
"Key Materiality Aspects at ­
Vonovia
A home is a basic human need."
"We meet this basic need by 
creating new living space and letting existing living space."
"We do so 
through a governance structure that meets high value 
benchmarks and that is suited to being perceived as trust-
worthy and reliable by our stakeholders."
"In the 2023 reporting year, we once again performed a 
critical review of all topics against the backdrop of integra-
tion and consolidated reporting, as well as new regulations 
and changes in general conditions."
"This did not result in any 
changes as against the prior year’s assessment."
"The materiality analysis of sustainability topics that is 
presented here applies to the entire Group and represents 
the leading system for the non-financial topics."
Material topics are marked in bold.
"­
Vonovia has identified taxonomy-eligible activities under EU 
environmental objective 1 (climate change mitigation, CCM) 
in its business model."
"Some of these activities would also be 
taxonomy-eligible under EU environmental objective 4 
(transition to a circular economy, CE)."
"In order to avoid 
double counting, ­
Vonovia allocates these in full to EU 
environmental objective 1."
"The new EU environmental objectives result, to a small 
extent, in additional taxonomy eligibility for ­
Vonovia under 
EU environmental objective 4."
"EU environmental objectives 
3 (sustainable use and protection of water and marine 
resources, WTR), 5 (pollution prevention and control, PPC) 
and 6 (protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosys-
tems, BIO) do not result in any further taxonomy eligibility."
"The 
Care segment is no longer reported under turnover for 
the 2023 fiscal year, but rather separately as a discontinued 
operation."
"­
Vonovia is not affected by any economic activities related to 
energy generation from fossil gas or nuclear energy."
"As a 
result, ­
Vonovia does not submit the specific reporting forms 
for these activities."
"The largest share of taxonomy-aligned turnover can be 
attributed to rental income from taxonomy-aligned buildings 
(activity 7.7)."
"A large share of taxonomy-aligned capital 
expenditure is accounted for by the renovation of existing 
buildings (7.2) and investments in the portfolio and Develop-
ment to hold (7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings), in 
particular."
"Taxonomy-aligned Shares of ­
Vonovia’s Business Activities
Review of Substantial Contribution
The obligation to review taxonomy alignment for the 2023 
reporting year extends exclusively to activities relating to EU 
environmental objectives 1 and 2."
"Turnover associated with new construction (activity 7.1) is 
deemed taxonomy-aligned if the relevant buildings have a 
primary energy demand that is at least 10% below the 
national standard for nearly zero-energy buildings."
"­
Vonovia 
checks compliance by obtaining an energy performance 
certificate for each building."
"The relevant buildings undergo 
the thermal integrity and airtightness test."
"­
Vonovia checks compliance by obtaining an energy 
performance certificate for each building."
"We base our 
assessment of the top 15 percent on relevant threshold 
values for primary energy demand for Germany, Austria and 
Sweden, which were determined in a recent benchmark 
study."
"For buildings constructed after December 31, 2020, 
the same criteria for substantial contribution to climate 
change mitigation apply as for new construction (activity 
7.1)."
"Turnover from electricity generation using solar photovolta-
ic technology (activity 4.1) is treated as a direct climate 
change mitigation measure in the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"­
Vonovia verifies the required 
30% reduction in primary energy demand through energy-­
efficiency assessments or based on energy certificates."
"Capital expenditure as part of energy-efficient modernization 
projects is allocated to activity 7.2."
"Capital expenditure on 
heating modernization, charging stations and wall boxes, 
metering technology and smart metering, and photovoltaic 
systems is generally treated as a direct climate protection 
measure and is allocated to activities 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6."
"Activity 7.7 “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in-
cludes capital expenditure from acquisitions, Development 
to hold, investments not including energy efficiency mea-
sures (e.g., vacant apartment renovations) or other internal 
expenses that can be capitalized."
"These qualify as 
taxonomy-­
aligned if the building-related technical valuation 
criteria are met."
"The relevant criteria for determining taxonomy-aligned 
operating expenses stem from activity 7.7."
"This is non-­
capitalized maintenance (usually minor maintenance)."

this also includes services provided internally by the compa-
ny’s own craftsmen’s organization."
"Capital expenditure on the fleet (3.3) is not subject to any 
detailed alignment review."
"­
Vonovia’s fleet is gradually being 
switched to alternative drive systems; at present, only a 
small number of vehicles meet the required threshold for 
CO2 emissions."
"Capital expenditure in connection with the 
purchase of electrical and electronic goods (1.2) is not 
subject to any mandatory alignment review in the 2023 
reporting year."
"­
Vonovia uses an IT tool to 
identify and evaluate physical climate risks for the Group-
wide portfolio on a continuous basis using the prescribed 
climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) (see Environ-
mental Issues)."
"In this 
scenario, no material risk has been identified for any of the 
climate-related hazards up to 2045."
"Therefore, no adaptation 
plan is required in accordance with the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation."
"As part of the neighborhood strategy, potential 
adaptations are to be defined at portfolio level in the future 
and subsequently implemented individually for the proper-
ties or neighborhoods for which there are material risks at 
the corresponding level."
"With regard to the sustainable use and protection of water 
and marine resources (EU environmental objective 3), no 
criteria need to be assessed for the taxonomy-eligible 
economic activities for residential building units."
"This ensures that the requirements are imple-
mented for each project."
"The selected building and con-
struction technology strengthens resource efficiency, 
adaptability and dismantling capacity, taking into account 
the requirements set out in the ISO 20887 standard."
"The 
photovoltaic systems installed by ­
Vonovia also meet the 
requirements for preventing significant harm to EU environ-
mental objective 4 on account of their design and service 
life."
"In order to avoid and prevent environmental pollution (EU 
environmental objective 5), compliance with certain EU 
directives must be ensured (Appendix C to Annex 1 to the 
Supplement to EU Regulation 2020/852)."
"Compliance with 
statutory requirements is defined in ­
Vonovia’s Business 
Partner Code that all subcontractors and suppliers have to 
sign."
"­
Vonovia has established a toxic materials management 
system to ensure the safe handling of toxic materials."
"Among other measures, safety fact sheets and operating 
instructions are kept for affected products and the compa-
ny’s own employees are trained on how to handle these 
products correctly from an occupational safety perspective."
"Substances of very high concern (SVHC) cannot generally 
be found in the construction materials used."
"If these sub-
stances are identified in very small quantities in individual 
cases, ­
Vonovia looks into options for replacing them on an 
ongoing basis."
"­
Vonovia’s economic activities do not significantly harm the 
achievement of EU environmental objective 6 (protection 
and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems), as ­
Vonovia 
only builds in designated areas and with a building permit."
"A due diligence process to avoid scenarios in which business 
activities have negative impacts on people and the environ-
ment forms the core of compliance with the minimum 
safeguards."
"Taking the OECD Guidelines as a basis, ­
Vonovia 
has implemented all of the recommended due diligence 
steps."
"In the reporting year, we conducted a human rights 
and environmental risk analysis for our own business area 
and the supply chain."
"Further information on the implemen-
tation of human rights due diligence at ­
Vonovia can be found 
in the section
 Respect for Human Rights."
"Duplicate counting is avoided by means of direct allocation 
of the taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned turnover, 
capital expenditure and operating expenses to a taxonomy-­
eligible or taxonomy-aligned economic activity."
"Turnover
The Group’s consolidated turnover is taken into account in 
the denominator (total net turnover)."
"This comprises 
turnover from property management, income from the sale 
of properties, income from the disposal of properties held 
for sale and turnover from the disposal of real estate inven-
tories."
"Taxonomy-­
aligned net turnover (numerator) is comprised of amounts 
generated through taxonomy-aligned economic activities."
"Rental income from the Rental segment accounts for the 
largest share of taxonomy-aligned turnover (€ 705 million)."
"In this case, compliance is assessed on a building-by-build-
ing basis taking into account the technical criteria for activity 
7.7."
"Turnover from completed residential properties for our 
own use (Development to hold) has been reported under 
turnover for 7.7 based on the completion date."
"The increase 
is due to a larger proportion of aligned buildings."
"€ 226 million of aligned turnover under activity 7.7 is 
based on the sale of aligned investment properties."
"The turnover from the Development to sell segment 
(€ 250 million), which is shown under activity 7.1, is based on 
the proceeds from the disposal of new builds."
"These decline 
due to the current market situation."
"The taxonomy-aligned 
share within activity 7.1, however, rose from 60.2 percent to 
70.7 percent."
"The turnover for activity 4.1 (€ 1.9 million) is 
generated by the feed-in tariff paid for supplying electricity 
to the grid as well as the direct sale of electricity to tenants."
"Total turnover
 [C23] Segment Reporting is down by 
€ 2,886 million year-on-year."
"In particular, the portfolio sold 
to the federal state of Berlin (Berlin deal) had increased total 
turnover in the 2022 fiscal year, reducing overall alignment."
"Completed residential property for our own portfolio (Devel-
opment to hold) is shown in the consolidated financial 
statements as capital expenditure under 7.7."
"No turnover is 
gained from this."
"The internal turnover of the Value-add 
companies, e.g., services provided by craftsmen, is eliminat-
ed in the course of Group consolidation and is therefore not 
taken into account in taxonomy-eligible turnover."
"If the 
services provided internally are larger projects, e.g., energy-­
efficient modernization measures, they are capitalized and 
shown as capital expenditure (CapEx)."
"Capital Expenditure
In accordance with the EU taxonomy, the denominator for 
capital expenditure (CapEx) is composed of additions to 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets."
"For 
accounting details, please refer to chapters
 [D26] Intangible 
Assets,
 [D27] Property, Plant and Equipment and [D28] Investment 
Properties in the Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial 
statements."
"The individual additions and capitalized mod-
ernization costs were taken into account when calculating 
the denominator."
"For projects lasting several years in the areas 7.2, 7.3 or 7.7, 
the capitalized amount for the relevant reporting year is 
reported as taxonomy-eligible and, provided the relevant 
criteria are met, taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure."
"For 
activities 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6, the capital expenditure is shown in 
the year of asset capitalization."
"When it comes to capital 
expenditure, the EU Taxonomy Regulation makes a distinc-
tion between different categories of capital expenditure."
"Due to ­
Vonovia’s business model, it largely invests (activity 
7.2 and 7.7) in assets or processes associated with economic 
activities that are taxonomy-aligned (category A)."
"It also 
makes investments (activity 7.3–7.6) relating to individual 
measures through which the target activities are carried out 
in a low-carbon manner or the emission of greenhouse gases 
is lowered (category C)."
"Capital expenditure for the fleet 
(3.3) and for the purchase of electrical and electronic goods 
(1.2) also constitutes taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure 
under category C."
"With regard to developed land, the CapEx for buildings and 
land has been included as additions, as economic activity 7.7 
cannot be performed without the relevant land."
"Capital expenditure in the context of ­
Vonovia’s capitalized 
internal expenses is reviewed for taxonomy alignment and 
allocated to 7.2, 7.3 or 7.7 depending on the type of invest-
ment."
"In order to avoid duplicate counting of capital expen-
diture, the items are allocated to just one activity in each 
case."
"Taxonomy alignment is assessed for each building or 
project."
"In addition to capitalized internal expenses, the 
addition of other property, such as Development to hold 
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
57
additions or other acquisitions of investment properties, is 
reported under 7.7."
"The taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure (numerator) 
comprises additions to investment properties (€ 285 mil-
lion)."
"Additions relating to property, plant and equipment 
came to € 36 million in total."
"These relate to photovoltaic 
technology (€ 30 million/7.6), metering technology (€ 5 mil-
lion/7.5) and charging stations (€ 1 million/7.4)."
"There was 
an addition to right-of-use assets (€ 5 million) for metering 
technology (€ 3 million/7.5) and heating systems (€ 2 mil-
lion/7.3)."
"There were no additions resulting from business 
combinations during this reporting year."
"Compared to the previous year, CapEx fell significantly 
overall (from € 2,483 million to € 1,203 million)."
"The aligned 
share fell from € 774 million to € 326 million."
"This can be 
traced back to the overall reduction in the investment 
strategy due to the tense interest rate situation."
"A large 
number of development projects were sold as opposed to 
added to the company’s own portfolio."
"This means that the 
aligned share of additions to investment properties (7.7) fell 
from € 443 million to € 141 million."
"The capitalization of 
modernization measures (7.2) also fell accordingly from 
€ 239 million to € 97 million."
"There was also a downward 
trend in the area of heating modernization (7.3) from 
€ 80 million to € 11 million."
"By contrast, there was a signifi-
cant increase from € 6 million to € 30 million in activity 7.6 
due to a strong commitment to the expansion of photovolta-
ic systems."
"We have issued green bonds on the capital market based on 
the
 ­
Vonovia Sustainable Finance Framework 2022."
"2023 also saw 
us take out a green loan."
"The proceeds from these issues are 
used exclusively to (re)finance real estate that has been 
confirmed to be green."
"We use a portfolio-based approach, 
which means that funds cannot be allocated to specific 
properties."
"As a result, it was not possible to make adjust-
ments for the taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure fi-
nanced using these bonds or debentures, or corresponding 
turnover from environmentally sustainable buildings for the 
purposes of reporting the taxonomy-aligned performance 
indicators."
"Pursuant to the requirements, we include expenses for 
upkeep and repair (maintenance) when defining the denom-
inator."
"At ­
Vonovia, maintenance measures are mainly 
carried out by the internal craftsmen’s organization, which is 
why we also include these items (technicians’ and adminis-
trative costs) in the denominator."
"Duplicate counting is 
avoided due to the fact that capitalized shares, as capital 
expenditure, reduce maintenance costs accordingly."
"As a 
result, the denominator reflects the non-capitalized mainte-
nance expenses."
"These maintenance costs and, in particular, 
the personnel costs associated with the company’s own staff 
cannot be allocated separately to the individual buildings 
when posting expenses."
"In addition, the operating expenses 
incurred for the individual activities 7.2 to 7.7 cannot be 
attributed individually."
"­
Vonovia thus allocates all mainte-
nance costs to activity 7.7."
"To determine the taxonomy-­
aligned data, we use an allocation factor for maintenance 
expenses based on the area of the building (in sqm)."
"This 
share is multiplied by the taxonomy-eligible operating 
expenses to calculate the numerator."
"The non-taxonomy-­
eligible shares, e.g., condominium administration mainte-
nance expenses, are not taken into account."
"The share of

"Environmental Issues
Environmental issues include the following material topics 
for ­
Vonovia: “Reducing CO2 in the real estate portfolio” and 
“Sustainable new construction and refurbishment” (see
 Materiality Matrix)."
"The mitigation of global warming and the protection of 
natural resources for life on earth are some of the most 
important challenges facing society as a whole in our time."
"As such, environmental and climate protection is accorded 
paramount importance within our sustainability strategy."
"Targets set at international level, such as the Paris Agree-
ment and the European Union Green Deal, as well as those 
set at national level, such as the goal set by the German 
Federal Government to achieve climate neutrality by 2045, 
are of high significance for ­
Vonovia in this regard."
"As Europe’s housing industry market leader with our own 
real estate portfolio of 545,919 residential units and our 
development activities, we possess significant levers for 
protecting the environmental and climate."
"Development of energy sector according to Scenario Agora 
    Energiewende KNDE 20245; For comparison: CRREM pathway MFH 1.5° DE 2045=4kg CO2e/sqm per year (07/2021); Climate pathway development supported by Fraunhofer ISE."
"Greenhouse gas emissions from the upstream 
value chain (Scope 3 emissions) and other environmental 
aspects are also relevant for us, meaning that we are in-
creasingly collecting data on them."
"­
Vonovia has set itself the target of achieving a virtually 
greenhouse gas-neutral housing stock by 2045, with carbon 
intensity of less than 5 kg of CO₂ equivalents per sqm of 
rental area (in terms of Scope 1, 2 and 3.3)."
"By 2030, our 
housing stock in Germany is to have a CO₂ intensity of less 
than 25 kg CO₂e per sqm."
"Binding interim targets have been 
defined for the next five years so that we can achieve this 
goal."
"We had our climate pathway’s compatibility with the Paris 
Agreement target calculated using the XDC model from 
right.based on science in 2022."
"The XDC model converts 
CO2 emissions based on our climate pathway into a number 
of degrees that shows by how much the earth’s temperature 
would increase if the entire world’s climate performance 
were identical to that of ­
Vonovia."
"The 1.5° target path of the 
Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) for multifamily 
residences in Germany (as of July 2021) was used as a 
benchmark."
"This calculation revealed that, taking into 
account long-term sales that are already planned and 
Recurring Sales, ­
Vonovia’s climate pathway is compatible 
with global warming of 1.4° Celsius."
"Defining and implementing the climate pathway is part of 
our systematic way of tackling climate change – with regard 
to both ­
Vonovia's contribution to mitigating climate change 
and the effects of climate change on our company’s eco-
nomic development."
"The recommendations made by the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
constitute important guidance in this regard."
"Since 2022, ­
Vonovia has been using an IT tool in accordance 
with EU taxonomy requirements in order to analyze the 
physical risks associated with climate change."
"This tool 
enables physical climate risks to be identified and evaluated 
for the Group-wide portfolio on a continuous basis using the 
prescribed climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)."
"This climate risk tool covers ­
Vonovia’s portfolio and develop-
ment projects in Germany, Austria and Sweden and allows 
material negative impacts on our business activities due to 
the effects of climate change to be analyzed at portfolio and 
property level."
"The climate risks examined using this tool are 
heat, drought, increases in precipitation, wind and storms, 
snow loads and flooding."
"Depending on the granularity of 
the available data source, we measure climate risks at the 
building or neighborhood level and are able to identify the 
climate risks for each building in the portfolio and, as a 
result, its vulnerability."
"In this scenario, no material risk at 
portfolio level has been identified for any of the climate-­
related hazards up to 2045."
"Relevant risks could arise at the level of individual neighbor-
hoods or buildings."
"As part of ­
Vonovia’s modernization 
strategy, potential adaptations are to be defined at portfolio 
level in the future and then implemented individually for the 
properties or neighborhoods concerned."
"Adaptation mea-
sures include, in particular, insulating buildings and replacing 
windows to provide protection against heat and cold, 
creating shade using blinds and shutters, and installing 
suitable equipment designed to handle the infiltration and 
absorption of larger amounts of precipitation."
"In the future, 
the individual findings from the climate risk analysis will be 
incorporated into the specific neighborhood profiles that 
provide the guidelines for managing and developing a 
neighborhood."

CO2 Reduction in the Real Estate Portfolio
The CO2 intensity of the building portfolio represents the 
central indicator of our climate performance management."
"It 
is also an extremely important component of the Sustain-
ability Performance Index (SPI) and therefore of the Man-
agement System and the renumeration paid to senior 
management."
"In the reporting year, the CO2 intensity for our 
housing stock in Germany was 31.7 kg CO2e per sqm of 
rental area, down by around 3.9% year-on-year (2022: 33.0 
kg CO2e per sqm)."
"In addition to the modernization mea-
sures implemented in the reporting year despite the lower 
investment volume, this development can also be traced 
back to numerous energy certificate updates."
"As the eco-
nomic conditions remain challenging, for example the 
increased cost of capital and construction costs and the 
uncertain subsidy conditions, we have nevertheless kept the 
medium-term targets of our climate pathway unchanged."
"For 2024, this equates to a figure that is roughly on a par 
with the previous year."
"If, however, we manage to implement 
our reduction levers successfully, we are confident that we 
will once again report figures that are below those set out in 
our climate pathway."

"The transformation plan for our housing stock, our climate 
pathway, consists of three levers: 
1."
"Saving energy through energy-efficient modernization of 
the building envelope
2."
"Increasing the share of renewable energies in the 
­
neighborhood 
3."
"Fundamental transformation of the energy sector
In order to operationalize this transformation plan, ­
Vonovia 
uses the decarbonization tool (DCT), which maps its hous-
ing stock with all of the relevant ecological and economic 
characteristics."
"The DCT provides an overall plan showing 
how the housing stock needs to be modernized in detail in 
order to meet the Group’s overall target and the time frame 
in which this must be done."
"Individual solution plans are 
identified for all buildings which are then set out in more 
specific detail in the plans for energy-efficient modernization 
and the energy concepts."
"In doing so, we adopt a holistic view at neighborhood level, 
examining both the modernization of the building envelope 
(insulation of facades, basement ceilings and attics, and 
replacement of windows) and the conversion of the energy 
supply to climate-friendly systems in their wider context."
"We believe that many integrated solutions for energy 
provision with renewable energies and CO₂ optimization can 
often be implemented in a more technically feasible and 
economically viable way within larger neighborhoods."
"Our 
approach is shaped by the concept of sequential develop-
ment."
"This means that, depending on the efficiency class 
and existing energy supply, the measures to enhance the 
individual buildings and advance towards the 2045 targets 
set in the climate pathway are staggered in some cases."
"When it comes to the specific implementation process, 
tailored and economically viable concepts are developed for 
scalable solutions that focus on linking the heat, electricity 
and mobility sectors."
"Public-sector subsidy programs are being used for many of 
the modernization measures in order to minimize the costs 
for our tenants."
"Here, federal subsidies for energy-efficient 
buildings (BEG) play a particularly crucial role."
"Planning in 
the real estate sector involves long timescales and is com-
plex, especially in a neighborhood context."
"Uncertainty 
surrounding the continuation of subsidy programs that have 
been initiated, or surrounding the structure of programs that 
have been announced, is currently making it much more 
difficult for us to plan."
"We achieved an overall refurbishment rate of 1.2% in the 
reporting year."
"The year-on-year decline (2022: 1.8% exclud-
ing ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen) can be traced back to the fact that 
the 2023 investment volume was lower owing to the sharp 
rise in the cost of capital."
"Nevertheless, we exceeded our 
target corridor of between 0.3% and 0.8%."
"This was due to 
numerous modernization projects implemented by ­
Deutsche 
­
Wohnen that had already been commenced before the 
reporting year and were completed in 2023."
"Looking ahead 
to 2024, we expect the refurbishment rate to be roughly on 
the same level as 2023."

"In order to make energy-efficient building refurbishment 
even more cost-effective in the medium and long term, we 
continued to forge ahead further with serial refurbishment in 
the reporting year."
"Following on from a pilot project imple-
mented in Bochum in 2022, another refurbishment project 
based on the Energiesprong principle was carried out in the 
reporting year."
"In Witten, four and, for the first time, 
eight-story apartment buildings including six to 24 apart-
ments were fitted with prefabricated, glass-faced facade 
elements featuring a honeycomb structure that allows solar 
radiation to be used to generate heat."
"Heat is also generated 
by a highly efficient heat pump powered by green electricity 
generated by photovoltaics on the roof and facades."
"The 
windows have integrated blinds and allow for living area 
ventilation."
"Overall, the project will upgrade the buildings 
from energy efficiency class E to A+ after the refurbishment."
"The project is cost-neutral for tenants in the medium and 
long term."
"Preparations for further serial refurbishment 
projects are currently underway."
"Since as early as 2022, we have been accelerating the 
electrification of heat generation through our heat pump 
initiative, a key component in our quest to implement our 
climate pathway."
"Based on a pilot batch of 50 heating 
networks involving 108 buildings in Dortmund, primarily 
implemented in the reporting year, key challenges related to 
use of the technology in apartment buildings were identified 
and addressed with relevant stakeholders."
"In addition to the 
installation of the air-to-water heat pumps, the focus was 
also on replacing radiators wherever this was necessary in 
order to further reduce the supply temperature to enable 
efficient heat pump operation."
"The measure will reduce the 
carbon emissions from the 50 heating networks by 40%."
"The 
findings will be used to expand the initiative to cover other 
regions."
"Another aspect of implementing the climate pathway is 
increasing energy generation from renewable sources."
"­
Vonovia continued the program it had launched back in 2021 
to expand electricity generation using photovoltaics in the 
reporting year."
"The focus is on ensuring that the electricity 
generated is used directly in the neighborhood – to supply 
our tenants and to operate heat pumps."
"The installation of 
these systems is therefore also closely interlinked with the 
heat pump initiative and the modernization program."
"At the end of the reporting year, ­
Vonovia owned 1,353 photo-
voltaic systems with an installed output of 53.1 MWp."
"This 
outstripped the target of 43.3 MWp by far (+22.6%)."
"Starting 
in 2024, the pace of PV expansion is to be accelerated 
significantly again: Instead of our original plan of having 
around 280 MWp of installed capacity by 2030, we are 
aiming to install around 300 MWp of capacity by the end 
of 2026."
"We are aiming for additional capacity of 80 MWp in 
the 2024 fiscal year."
"In the long term, we intend to fit all 
suitable roof spaces in the German portfolio with PV panels 
by 2050."

"The reporting year saw ­
Vonovia set up an integrated system 
for housing-related infrastructure services under the 
“­
Quartierwerk“ umbrella."
"This encompasses activities 
relating to renewable energies and energy sales, as well as 
metering services, multimedia and the Internet of Things 
(IoT)."
"­
Vonovia is offering its customers the opportunity to pur-
chase electricity from renewable energy sources via its own 
energy distribution company (VESG)."
"By providing green 
energy that has been generated or certified in the neighbor-
hood, we are supplying 45,000 households with around 50 
GWh of low-cost electricity and helping them to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions."
"Our objective is to maximize the 
share of energy we produce ourselves for the benefit of our 
customers and the environment, and also to use it for our 
housing-related services, e.g., e-mobility."
"The purchase of 
certified green electricity to supply communal areas makes a 
further contribution to our climate strategy."
"­
Vonovia is also forging ahead with digitalization in the field 
of heat supply."
"In the reporting year, more than 1,450 gas-
fired heating systems had already been connected to a 
digital solution developed in collaboration with the start-up 
Othermo, which detects heating system failures in real time 
and supports optimized adjustments to the system technol-
ogy."
"This system offers the potential to save around 15% in 
energy and CO2, with direct benefits for tenants."
"The energy innovation team, which is part of the Innovation 
& Business Building department, actively works to help 
ensure that climate pathway targets are met by analyzing 
and testing innovative technologies."
"Projects in the reporting 
year focused on the introduction of a simulation tool that 
allows even complex energy systems and flows in the 
neighborhood to be mapped in various configurations in a 
short space of time."
"This allows the technical and commer-
cial design of new technologies to be analyzed directly in 
detail, allowing for faster and better decisions in the context 
of specific neighborhood development."
"Preparations were 
also under way for a pilot project for the selection and 
introduction of an energy management system in the 
reporting year."
"The aim is to make a central technical system 
operational for efficient operational control and optimization 
as well as flexible marketing of electricity generation from 
photovoltaics."
"The pilot 
projects will start at the beginning of 2024."
"­
Vonovia is also 
partnering in two funded research projects."
"The EU-funded 
Neutralpath project in Dresden is looking into how the 
district heating supply temperature can be reduced and the 
formation of legionella prevented at the same time."
"Seven 
different technological systems are being tested are part of 
the project."
"The ReFaTEk project is researching what is 
known as the energy clinker, a technology in which the 
facade is to serve as an additional heat source for a heat 
pump via a brine pipeline in the clinker."
"A further key lever for our climate pathway is the supply of 
sufficient quantities of CO₂-free district heating and electric-
ity by the energy sector."
"This requires the energy sector to 
implement the targets set by policymakers for phasing out 
coal and increasing the share of renewable energies in 
energy or electricity generation."
"We consider the mandatory 
municipal heating planning process to be an important step 
towards this goal."
"This can provide long-term planning 
security with respect to the availability of district heating 
within the municipalities."
"The German Heat Planning Act 
(Wärmeplanungsgesetz) also features mandatory targets 
for the decarbonization of heating networks."
"One good 
example in practice is the Bochum heat transition project 
that ­
Vonovia is involved in."
"One key element of this project 
involves adopting an integrated view of heat and electricity 
generation that takes all stakeholders in the municipality 
into account."
"District heating is always an important lever 
for us where it is economically viable to connect additional 
properties to a district heating network while making 
consistent progress in decarbonizing heat generation by 
public utilities companies."
"As a result, ­
Vonovia is examining 
the decarbonization strategies of the most important district 
heating providers and, based on these conclusions, drawing 
up potential courses of action for incorporating them into its 
long-term neighborhood strategy."
"The Portfolio Management department, which reports to the 
Chief Rental Officer (CRO), is responsible for coordinating 
the energy-efficient modernization activities."
"The neighbor-
hoods and buildings to be modernized are selected in a 
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
71
targeted manner in cooperation with the regions, and the 
optimal degree of modernization and modernization road-
map for each building is defined."
"The investments for the 
modernization programs and PV expansion are approved by 
the Management Board."
"The newly established “Quartier­
werk“ unit is also part of the Chief Rental Officer’s (CRO) 
executive division, meaning that it is closely linked to the 
management of the portfolio."
"Innovation & Business Building 
with the energy innovation team falls under the CEO’s 
executive division."
"In Austria, energy efficiency modernization measures are, 
just like overall business operations in Austria, the responsi-
bility of the Chief Development Officer (CDO) under the 
BUWOG umbrella, where they are led by the Real Estate 
Management division."
"Since 2011, BUWOG has been a 
partner of the “klimaaktiv Pakt” climate protection initiative 
launched by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate 
Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and 
Technology."
"As part of this initiative, BUWOG has defined 
the goal of achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emis-
sions of 55% and an increase in energy efficiency of 35% 
by 2030 compared to the baseline year of 2005."
"Both targets 
are likely to be met ahead of time."
"Fur-
thermore, all oil heating systems are to be replaced by 2030, 
five years earlier than required by law."
"BUWOG has had a 
certified energy management system that is consistent with 
ISO 50001 standards in place in Austria since 2013/2014 and 
in Germany since 2018."
"The system is a tool used voluntarily 
to systematically manage energy performance and improve 
it continuously."
"The corresponding establishment of pro-
cesses that reflect this policy in the company and clear 
objectives serve to increase energy efficiency, reduce energy 
consumption and cut energy costs."
"The regular review audit 
was completed successfully in the reporting year."
"In Sweden, around 90% of existing Victoriahem buildings are 
supplied with district heating, the generation of which 
already produces extremely low CO₂ emissions."
"Therefore, 
the road to climate neutrality at Victoriahem will primarily 
be shaped by further decarbonization of heating supply, 
coupled with ongoing improvements in energy efficiency."
"Heat pumps are also being installed in selected buildings 
during modernization work to support the heat supply and 
make it more flexible."
"The aim is to reduce energy consump-
tion (electricity and heat) by 30% per sqm by 2030 com-
pared to 2015."
The current reduction level is around 25%.
"In 2022, Victoriahem also joined the Swedish housing 
association’s “Allmännyttans klimatinitiativ”, which aims to 
achieve an energy supply that does not feature any fossil 
fuels by 2030."
"Sustainable Construction and Refurbishment
­
Vonovia’s new construction activities are helping to create 
urgently needed new and affordable homes, especially in 
metropolitan areas."
"The development business operating 
under the BUWOG brand is active in both the development 
of attractive, sustainable and diverse residential neighbor-
hoods in Germany and Austria, and the densification of 
buildings as part of the development of existing neighbor-
hoods."
"The activities of the BUWOG development business 
in Germany and Austria are the responsibility of the Chief 
Development Officer (CDO), and the individual develop-
ment projects are approved by the Management Board."
"By taking a holistic neighborhood-based approach to devel-
opments, we bring together planning expertise and con-
struction."
"Our focus is on the development of large, inner-­
city properties in major cities (known as brownfield 
projects) that require a whole range of requirements to be 
taken into account."
"This allows us to create additional 
homes and avoid additional sealing, for example by convert-
ing sealed industrial areas into state-of-the-art residential 
neighborhoods."
"Our approach is complemented by our 
Building Information Management (BIM) strategy, which 
allows us to identify effective measures on the basis of data 
from across the entire life cycle of our neighborhoods."
"The average primary energy demand of newly constructed 
buildings, in relation to rental area, is the most important 
non-financial performance indicator in development."
"This 
performance indicator is part of the Sustainability Perfor-
mance Index (SPI) and planning process and must be made 
transparent as part of all Management Board approvals of 
new-build and development projects."
"In 2023, the average 
primary energy demand was 25.3 kWh per sqm per year, 
down considerably on that of the previous year as planned."
"We anticipate higher primary energy demand for 2024 due 
to a number of projects resulting from the merger with

"Guides, specifications and tools have been devel-
oped in 14 topic areas to address the full range of sustain-
ability aspects in new construction."
"These include optimized 
heat supply in the neighborhood, the use of ecological 
building materials and designs for open spaces."
"The strategy 
is based on the use of the German efficiency house standard 
or the basic criteria of Austria’s “klimaaktiv” initiative."
"The method saves around 64% in CO2 com-
pared to conventional concrete construction."
"The method 
also involves unsealing the soil: A site that was previously 
fully sealed will be largely unsealed and landscaped as part 
of the neighborhood development plans."
"Designing the residential environment and preserving 
biodiversity are top priorities for us."
"Numerous buildings fea-
ture green spaces that serve as natural habitats for flora and 
fauna at ground level, on roofs or on facades."
"We also take care to conserve resources and protect 
the environment during construction."
"We also take the 
neighborhood criteria of the DGNB (German Sustainable 
Building Council) for biodiversity (ENV2.4) and water cycle 
systems (ENV2.2) into consideration and already meet these 
standards in various neighborhoods."
"Neighborhood Development and Contribution to Infra-
structure
The social megatrends of climate change, urbanization and 
demographic change continue to determine the framework 
conditions within which housing providers must develop 
their services and solutions."
"Thinking and acting in terms of neighborhoods is our answer 
to these crucial megatrends – it is also the approach we 
adopt to find solutions for the economic, environmental and 
social development of our urban housing portfolios, which 
are largely located in urban quarters."
"It comprises at 
least 150 apartments (see
 Portfolio Structure)."
"This neighborhood-based, holistic view of the portfolio 
expands our spectrum of measures for designing our portfo-
lio using networked approaches and new technical capabili-
ties, thereby helping us to develop places of shared living 
with a socially and environmentally viable future."
"This 
process sees us work with stakeholders on location to 
develop the right concepts."
"Our neighborhood developments 
are designed to comply with clear climate protection re-
quirements (see
 Environmental Issues)."
"Environmental and social aspects go hand in hand as part of 
the neighborhood approach."
"­
Vonovia is equally committed 
to both aspects and to promoting social interaction in the 
local community."
"Measures to strengthen shared living only 
become manageable and effective through the neighbor-
hood approach."
"This is a process involving city and munici-
pal authorities, local stakeholders and our tenants in order to 
jointly develop solutions for the neighborhood."
"We use a 
range of participatory processes, instruments and coopera-
tion initiatives to achieve this, e.g., by making premises avail-
able, establishing services, neighborhood meet-ups and day 
care centers hand in hand with cooperation partners that 
focus on the greater good."
"With our “freiRaum” concept, we 
also offer free, low-threshold locations for local initiatives 
and groups to allow people to get involved in social events in 
our neighborhoods."
"These flexible neighborhood space 
concepts are already in place in Dresden, Bremen and 
Hamburg and are designed to serve as a blueprint for the 
establishment of more central meeting spaces in various 
­
Vonovia neighborhoods."
"The investment program for neighborhood development 
defines the scope for operational implementation of 
­
Vonovia’s neighborhood approach."
"In 2023, 17 neighborhood 
developments across Germany, accounting for around 
9,500 residential units, were involved in this program, which 
is set to run for a period of several years."
"In response to the 
gloomy investment climate, we are currently taking a more 
differentiated approach to our neighborhood development 
measures, and dividing packages of measures into smaller 
chunks."
"For example, we are adapting modernization mea-
sures to take account of the limited investment opportuni-
ties and reflect demand, without losing sight of the neigh-
borhood as a management level."
"Our urban quarters are also 
reaping increasing benefits from further measures from 
other ­
Vonovia programs (modernization/heating replace-
ment/photovoltaics)."
"Nevertheless, we are trying to forge ahead with our plans for 
further multi-year neighborhood developments and are 
sticking to our commitment to our long-term goal of using 
modernization measures to optimize all urban quarters in 
the portfolio in line with our binding climate pathway."

"Due to the deterioration in the investment climate and 
resulting adjustments to this specific investment program, 
we were only able to use part of the € 62.8 million that had 
been earmarked for investment in neighborhood develop-
ments in Germany for the 2023 fiscal year in full."
"Depending 
on how interest rates developed, we also expect a reduced 
investment volume for this part of the program in 2024 as 
well."
"For us, neighborhood development also means being an 
active driver of the infrastructure transition."
"By way of 
example, we are taking targeted measures to upgrade our 
neighborhoods by establishing key local amenities, building 
playgrounds and designing green spaces and communal 
areas."
"We are also supporting the expansion of the fiber 
optic network in order to boost digital networking."
"One key component is promoting state-of-the-art mobility 
concepts."
"Our measures support the mobility transition 
towards lower-emission and less car-heavy mobility in our 
neighborhoods."
"When designing new construction projects, 
we pay attention to good public transport connections, focus 
increasingly on bicycle parking spaces and consider provid-
ing charging facilities for electric mobility from the planning 
stages."
"While the options available to us are more limited in our 
existing buildings, we want to make an important contribu-
tion to greener mobility here, too – e.g., by installing 
charging infrastructure for electric vehicles."
"With this aim in 
mind, we are planning to install 100 neighborhood charging 
stations in our existing neighborhood in 2024."
"Car and bike 
sharing services (including for electric vehicles) round off 
our offering."
"We are also working on ideas for similar con-
cepts in Sweden."
"In order to do an even better job of integrating affordable 
and sustainable mobility into our neighborhoods, we are

placing particular emphasis on strengthening cycling-related 
services."
"We are aiming to gradually connect our neighbor-
hoods to municipal cycle path networks and are seeing 
increasing demand among our customers for bicycle-related 
mobility solutions."
"With the establishment of the Group’s 
own start-up NEARBYK (
 https:/
/nearbyk.de) in 2023, we are 
offering e-bikes for purchase or hire as well as service points 
for bike repairs and maintenance."
"We will be testing this 
new service for a period of around 16 months, initially at 
three locations in Essen, Dresden and Bremen."
"Freely 
accessible repair stations and the rental of cargo bikes round 
off our range of services in selected other neighborhoods."
"Thanks to the Neighborhood Academy, an internal training 
and networking format, ­
Vonovia employees are trained as 
neighborhood development experts, promoting the skills 
required for a holistic neighborhood approach among our 
own workforce."
"Neighborhood development is planned and managed on a 
decentralized basis via the regions."
"The Chief Rental Officer 
(CRO) is the Management Board member responsible for 
the property management business as well as for customer 
service and portfolio management."
"We are increasingly 
using our own neighborhood developers for on-site imple-
mentation."
"This allows us to address any specific issues as 
and when they arise."
"The investment and participation formats are also the 
responsibility of, and are managed by, the regions, just like 
­
Vonovia’s social commitment."
"This approach is supplement-
ed, also from a quality assurance perspective, by centrally 
managed supporting measures via corporate communica-
tions."
"Living at Fair Prices
As a responsible company, we are committed to providing 
affordable housing that meets people’s needs."
"As such, we 
meet the basic human need for housing."
"In this context, the 
needs and life circumstances of our customers – as a reflec-
tion of society – differ in all kinds of ways."
"There are also 
differences in the situations on individual housing markets."
"In metropolitan areas, in particular, shortages of available 
housing often go hand in hand with strong demand."
"This already high demand resulting from the megatrend of 
urbanization is exacerbated further by the ongoing influx of 
refugees due to Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine."
"These developments continue to unfold against the back-
ground of high climate protection requirements, the fulfill-
ment of which is particularly cost-intensive in the buildings 
sector."
"Particularly with regard to modernization, it is there-
fore important to balance the economic and ecological 
perspectives without losing sight of what our tenants and 
those searching for an apartment can actually afford."
"The 
significantly higher energy costs associated with the energy 
crisis are putting further pressure on housing costs for many 
people."
"For us, it is of fundamental importance to be able to offer 
long-term housing prospects to as many people as possible."
"The fundamental challenge involves being able to provide a 
broad supply of housing at fair and transparent prices, while 
at the same time achieving a virtually climate-neutral 
housing stock, even in a more challenging environment."
"As development activities throughout Germany are current-
ly not at a level that is able to alleviate the pressure on 
demand due to the unfavorable investment environment, our 
core business – providing homes – is extremely important 
from a social perspective."
"Our rental prices are based on the 
usual local rents and – if available – on qualified rent indices."
"Rents are only adjusted in line with the statutory parame-
ters."
"Nevertheless, the average rent including ancillary 
expenses in our portfolio remains below 30% of the average 
disposable household income in Germany."
"We are in favor of 
regulatory intervention in the housing markets, as we believe 
that it helps to ensure social balance and creates a stable 
business environment as a result."
"When letting, we always 
observe the applicable country-specific legislation."
"In Sweden, rents are generally set as part of a binding, 
consensual process involving negotiations between tenants’ 
associations and landlords."
This means that prices are fixed.
"Increases tend to occur annually and after modernization to 
a higher standard."
"All of our apartments in Sweden are 
price-controlled."
"That said, reasonable compro-
mises must be made in favor of additional climate change 
mitigation measures."
"In the 2023 reporting year, an average 
of € 1.32 per sqm in modernization costs was passed on."
"In numerous cities and municipalities, we also offer subsi-
dized – in Germany around 38,000 of our homes are current-
ly price-controlled – and independently financed homes for 
people on low incomes and are responding to location-­
specific challenges with services tailored to people’s needs."
"The supplementary voluntary agreements that we conclude 
with municipal authorities include, for example, provisions 
governing fair rental conditions, the construction of new 
apartments or the strengthening of municipal housing 
construction companies and joint neighborhood develop-
ment."
"The fundamental concept on which all agreements are 
based is ­
Vonovia’s desire to work in partnership with politi-
cians and society to tackle municipal challenges and that 
the company takes specific societal and social challenges 
present within cities into account within its planning."
"Individual support programs constitute a further supplemen-
tary component of our work to enable fairly priced housing."
"The aim is to ensure that the people living in our homes have 
a safety net so that they can stay in their homes for a long 
time and housing remains affordable for them."
"We support 
them in this matter and offer personalized assistance to all 
tenants who are actively working with us to find a solution."
"These forms of assistance range from deferring rent and 
allowing payment to be made in installments, to offering 
help with housing allowance applications and other dealings 
with the authorities, relocation assistance and other practi-
cal forms of help."
"As part of our established social management system, we 
apply uniform standards to hardship cases in the event of 
modernization work and follow guidelines based on those of 
charitable associations."
"These standards and guidelines 
were agreed with the Tenants’ Association and other resi-
dential real estate companies in 2021."
"As such, we are 
contributing to greater reliability and transparency in cases 
of hardship."
"Also still in place are our special vested rights for people 
aged over 70 and our active support for people who have 
fallen into payment difficulties as a result of the coronavirus 
pandemic."
"Energy costs, and heating costs in particular, have shown 
very dynamic development over the past two years."
"The 
heating index published for 2022 estimates that the annual 
year-on-year increase in costs for consumers in Germany 
came to 81%."
"Households with gas-fired heating systems 
were particularly hard hit."
"This means that many tenants are 
worried about high additional heating costs and ancillary 
expenses."
"Even though we are generally not the energy 
supplier ourselves, but rather only pass on the costs charged 
by the energy providers concerned, we consider it our 
responsibility to support our tenants."
"With this in mind, we 
have developed a comprehensive package of measures to 
counteract the increase in costs caused by the energy crisis 
and inflation to the extent that we have the power to do so."
"These include reducing the nighttime temperature in our 
properties by one degree Celsius to save energy."
"Energy-­
saving tips help with claiming government benefits and 
individual solutions when tenants find themselves unable to 
cover energy costs."
"We provide our tenants with information in 
various languages, also on our website, about ways of saving 
energy (see 
 https:/
/www.vonovia.de/en/mein-zuhause/saving-energy)."
"Energy prices have also risen dramatically in Sweden since 
the start of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine."
"Due 
to the Swedish model of rents that already include ancillary 
costs, however, tenants only have to bear the price effect 
associated with electricity themselves, while landlords’ 
ancillary costs are on the rise due to the higher heat supply 
costs."
"This also, however, provides incentives for energy-­
efficient building refurbishment at the same time."
"We did 
not identify any critical changes affecting rental or for 
tenants due to energy prices in the reporting year."
"People who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless 
are a particularly vulnerable group in society when it comes 
to housing."
"­
Vonovia therefore makes this target group a key 
focus of its social commitment efforts."
"As such, we contin-
ued to engage in a number of projects and measures in this 
area in the reporting year."
"We pursue the “Housing First” 
approach that ensures that homeless people are provided 
with a standard tenancy agreement with all of the normal 
rights and obligations, regardless of any mental or physical 
health conditions that they might have."
"It is only after this 
that they are offered help in order to get some stability into 
their lives."
"­
Vonovia provides homes for this purpose across 
Germany as part of numerous cooperative initiatives."
"Rent structures and agreements with municipalities are 
managed in a decentralized manner via the regions."
"The 
individual measures are planned and coordinated in the 
Portfolio Management department."
"Homes That Meet People’s Needs and Demographic 
Change
Our aging society, a result of demographic change, means 
that our customers’ needs are changing, too."
"This poses new 
Non-financial Group Declaration
Combined Management Report —

challenges for the real estate market."
"The demand for 
senior-friendly housing is expected to outstrip supply in 
Germany by around two million by 2035."
"We are adapting our offering in response to these changing 
housing needs."
"Our aim is to ensure that our tenants can 
stay safe, healthy and independent in their homes over the 
long term."
"We want to keep existing customer groups in our 
properties for as long as possible and attract new ones."
"We are already planning to make a large share of our newly 
built apartments accessible and/or wheelchair-friendly."
"More important, however, is the low barrier for equipping 
and refurbishing apartments for people with impaired 
mobility."
"Homes that are completely barrier-free, according 
to German industry standard DIN 18040-2, are only neces-
sary in very rare cases."
"Rather, a small number of measures, 
such as the fitting of non-slip flooring or flush-to-floor 
showers, are often sufficient to significantly increase the 
level of living comfort in old age."
"New leases in particular 
offer us a good window of opportunity to carry out appropri-
ate renovation measures without inconveniencing tenants 
with construction work."
"We therefore aim to modernize around 30% of newly rented 
apartments every year so that they meet the demands of an 
aging society."
"To this end, we review existing buildings to 
determine their potential for accessibility."
"Due to the limited 
investment opportunities available, we were only able to 
(partially) modernize around 6,550 apartments (or 17.5% of 
newly let apartments) in 2023 to make them fully accessible."
"We have, however, clearly outstripped our original 2022 fore-
cast of around ten percent for 2023."
"As far as 2024 is con-
cerned, we expect to be able to return to the original level of 
around 30%."
"The modernization program relates to the German portfolio 
– there are no equivalent programs in Austria or Sweden, 
although making homes more accessible is also a consider-
ation there under the relevant building regulations."
"The Care segment comprises ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen’s nursing 
care and nursing care properties business segments."
"As of 
December 31, 2023, we employed a total of 3,825 people in 
care service or care home management within this segment."
"Care business operations are based on an independent 
system and process landscape."
"39 retirement and care 
homes are operated under the brands KATHARINENHOF 
and PFLEGEN & ­
Wohnen HAMBURG, 38 of which are owned 
by ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen."
"There are also an additional 33 
nursing care properties run by other agencies."
"The nursing 
care activities are currently being subjected to a strategic 
review and market tests by the Management Board of 
­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen (see
 Care and Assisted Living)."
"These facilities provide full residential care, the aim being to 
maintain an active lifestyle and residents’ independence to 
the greatest possible extent."
"Demand remained at a consis-
tently high level in the reporting year."
"Senior citizen-friendly 
services are also provided within the context of assisted 
living."
"With its Care segment, ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen makes a 
substantial contribution to addressing demographic change."
"In addition to structural measures, the social infrastructure 
in the neighborhood also plays a key role."
"­
Vonovia also 
works with cooperation partners that focus on the greater 
good to offer special forms of housing, such as senior-­
friendly 
apartments, services and neighborhood meet-ups, for 
example."
"Responsibility for the senior-friendly housing programs lies 
with the Management Board (CRO)."
"The structure of the 
renovation program is managed centrally and is implement-
ed via the regions."
"Customer Satisfaction and Service Quality
Customer satisfaction is instrumental in the success of a 
company."
"For us, this is mainly associated with the question 
of whether our tenants feel at home in their apartments and 
neighborhoods and whether they feel that they are treated 
fairly by us as their landlord."
"This 
requires a good deal of availability and speed, as well as 
employees who have been trained accordingly."
"This is both 
an opportunity and a risk, as the quality of customer care 
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
77
and services plays a central role."
"Our experience shows that 
accessibility, speed and transparency in service are decisive 
factors for achieving customer satisfaction."
"Our central, multilingual customer service department acts 
as the first port of call, whereas our caretakers and crafts-
men look after the needs of tenants on location."
"This allows 
us to ensure fast and reliable service."
"We run our own 
customer service centers in Essen, Dresden, and Berlin."
"Our 
employees undergo continuing professional development 
thanks to a centralized knowledge and training management 
program."
"Regular dialogue formats ensure performance and 
quality."
"The aim is to be able to guarantee the same level of 
quality for the entire portfolio in Germany."
"Our customers 
can reach our staff of more than 1,100 employees through a 
variety of channels."
"In addition to personal contact, the digitalization of our 
services that address customer concerns is an important 
field for us in order to make accessibility even faster, more 
convenient, and flexible."
"This is why we are continuing to 
expand self-service functions such as our “My ­
Vonovia” and 
“DeuWo Digital” tenant apps."
"Together, the two apps have 
already been downloaded more than 745,000 times and are 
actively used by around 215,000 users."
"In Austria, the BUWOG customer 
app was added to the app landscape in 2023."
"All of our tenants also have access to our whistleblower and 
complaints channels (see
 Combating Corruption and Bribery)."
"Customer satisfaction is measured using a quarterly cus-
tomer survey and is reflected in the Customer Satisfaction 
Index (CSI)."
"It is incorporated into the Management Board’s 
remuneration as a direct non-financial indicator and compo-
nent."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, the customer survey was 
extended to the ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen portfolio (excluding the 
Care segment)."
"The aim is to consolidate the high level 
achieved in recent years in the long run within this broader 
framework."
"BUWOG in Austria and Victoriahem in Sweden 
also carry out regular customer satisfaction surveys."
"Looking forward, we aim to introduce a harmonized CSI in 
Germany, Sweden and Austria in order to be able to com-
pare the results of the individual surveys."

"At ­
Vonovia, responsibility for customer service center lies 
with the CRO."
"While customer satisfaction is assigned to the 
customer service center in strategic terms, it affects all 
customer-facing operating departments and is ensured by 
each and every ­
Vonovia employee."
"The design and manage-
ment of the tenant apps are also the responsibility of cus-
tomer service."
"Appeal as an Employer
Over the coming years, it is estimated that the number of 
employees leaving the workforce will exceed the number 
that can be recruited after completing school by around 
400,000."
"This strategy involves using levers related to recruitment, 
talent management and measures of employee retention 
and, going forward, to is create even stronger, smart links 
between these aspects using state-of-the-art elements 
related to corporate culture."
"­
Vonovia is also committed to an insourcing strategy."
"This creates a huge opportu-
nity for our business success – at the same time, it creates 
greater responsibility for a much broader and more diverse 
workforce, which is why the ongoing further development of 
an HR strategy that is fit for the future is so important to us."
"As we progress on the path 
towards our target, issues relating to the further develop-
ment of our corporate culture, human capital development 
and remuneration, in particular, are to be given even more 
strategic emphasis in the future."
"As Europe’s biggest residential real estate company, we are 
particularly reliant on filling our vacancies with individuals 
from the available applicant pools who meet our require-
ments and match the relevant skill profiles."
"In 2023, we launched a revamp of our employer brand-
ing strategy and our image as an employer, and conducted 
broad-based analyses using industry benchmarks and 
stakeholder interviews in order to further develop our 
employer brand in a targeted manner."
"The first set of focal 
topics are to be elaborated and corresponding target 
group-oriented measures developed in the coming year."
"Following an initial successful recognition process for the 
initiative to recruit skilled workers from Colombia, which 
was launched back in 2021, a total of 17 new colleagues are 
now working for ­
Vonovia in electrical installation and 
landscape gardening in Kiel, Lübeck and Berlin."
"Another 26 
electronics technicians were recruited from Colombia as 
part of another round during the reporting year."
"The new 
employees will support the expansion of photovoltaic 
systems within ­
Vonovia’s technical service in the future."
"Our HR strategy focuses on the entire HR process, from 
recruitment to the point at which employees leave the 
company: People have complex and varied reasons for 
leaving."
"As a result, we want to better understand why our 
employees ultimately decide to leave ­
Vonovia."
"With this 
goal in mind, we have also been carrying out extensive 
qualitative staff turnover analyses since this fiscal year over 
and above our established quantitative analyses."
"We want to 
be able to use this information to identify even more target-
ed retention measures in the future."
"With regard to traineeship programs, we were able to 
achieve our goal from the previous reporting year of keeping 
the number of trainees at a consistently high level in 2023 
and increasing the number of trainees further from 617 
in 2022 to 632 trainees, a new record for ­
Vonovia."
"This value 
corresponds to a training rate of 5.3% (for Germany), above 
the average value of 4.4% for large companies with more 
than 500 employees calculated in the government’s 2021 
Vocational Training Report (Berufsbildungsbericht)."
"To 
support and create ideal training conditions at ­
Vonovia, we 
are expanding our training opportunities in 2024, following 
the merger with ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen, to include a Berlin-­
based initial and further training center focusing on voca-
tional training in the trades."
"Once completed, the building 
will be equipped in line with state-of-the-art technical and 
digital standards, and is to serve as a blueprint for the 
opening of further training sites based on the same model."
"In 2021, apprenticeship training was newly implemented at 
our subsidiary BUWOG in Austria, with the very first cohort 
completing their training in the reporting year."
"These activities 
were expanded to include other vacation periods in some 
regions in 2023 due to the positive response."
"Retaining existing employees is the third key lever in our 
human resources strategy, and also helps us shape a modern 
and attractive corporate culture."
"In this context, ­
Vonovia 
seeks to continually improve from within and to individually 
promote the potential and talents that our employees have 
to offer – this applies both to our employees and to our 
senior management."
"The ­
Vonovia Academy is our central 
element when it comes to developing our staff and creating 
a professional and respectful corporate culture in the long 
run."
"By way of example, some of the suggestions made in 
the employee survey were incorporated into direct measures 
to design new courses and digital learning formats to expand 
the ­
Vonovia Academy’s offering."
"This means that we are 
developing our employees’ skills and knowledge in an even 
more targeted way with a view to specific roles, functions 
and requirements in the workforce (e.g., learning formats for 
junior controllers)."
"Further, we have expanded our offer by 
including new development packages and formats."
"On-­
demand and e-learning services, such as specialized digital 
training courses for managers and employees, for example 
change consultation sessions, are designed to make further 
training and additional qualification at ­
Vonovia an even more 
flexible and personalized experience in the future."
"This 
regular short format allows managers to discuss ideas and 
receive advice from professional coaches on specific aspects 
and challenges associated with change processes."
"As part of 
the merger with ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen, which was formally 
completed in January 2023, over 900 employees were also 
integrated through team-based onboarding processes and 
were able to take part in process and system training ses-
sions through the ­
Vonovia Academy."
"At our Swedish subsidiary 
Victoriahem, the fourth cohort will complete the leadership 
talent development program in the first quarter of 2024."
"This 
program aims to prepare tomorrow’s managers, using 
candidates from the existing employee pool, for their future 
leadership roles."
"The satisfaction of our employees is a key concern and thus 
a decisive indicator for allowing us to assess our appeal as 
an employer."
"Since the 2021 reporting year, changes in the 
employee satisfaction level have been a component of the 
Group’s key non-financial performance indicator (SPI) and 
offer a regular indication of the degree to which ­
Vonovia is 
an attractive employer."
"This is directly and positively reflected 
in a higher participation rate, which, at 84%, has reached a 
record level compared to all previous surveys and sends out 
a signal for us as to just how willing our employees are to 
engage in dialogue."
"With

"The current survey now also includes all

Deutsche ­
Wohnen employees (including SYNVIA, excluding 
the Care segment) for the first time."
"This year’s result means 
that we have already exceeded our target for 2023 ahead of 
schedule, which is why we are planning to achieve a result 
for 2024 that is at least slightly below the previous year’s 
figure and remains within the target corridor of our five-year 
plan in the medium term."
"In 2023, BUWOG also received the 
Leading Employer Award in Austria and ranks among the top 
1% of Austrian employers among the 87,000 companies 
included in the evaluation."

have one’s say, for employee loyalty to our company."

"2023 was characterized by sustained high inflation and an 
associated rise in the cost of living."
"At the start of the 2023 
calendar year, our employees at ­
Vonovia saw a significant 
increase in their salaries thanks to combined regulations 
regarding a compensatory inflation bonus totaling up to 
€ 3,000 paid out over 24 months and an income-based pay 
rise."
"The majority of ­
Vonovia’s and ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen’s 
workforce in Germany are eligible for these benefits."
"During 
this process, we focused on income groups that are particu-
larly strongly affected by rising prices."
"We are using both 
additional benefits to recognize our employees’ good perfor-
mance."
"The company’s HR processes also support workplace 
flexibility through mobile working, made possible thanks to a 
works agreement, and the gradual expansion and further 
development of digital processes at ­
Vonovia."
"These include 
a wide range of functionalities that are already firmly estab-
lished, such as reporting absences due to illness via an app 
or digital banking of working hours, allowing employees in 
many of the company’s departments to work from a location 
of their choosing."
"The initiative comprises four 
focal topics that will be used to develop further measures as 
part of a step-by-step process: structuring various working 
models, state-of-the-art workplace design, digital tools and 
technologies, and training concepts for managers and 
employees alike."
"As of December 31, 2023, ­
Vonovia employed a workforce of 
15,802 (December 31, 2022: 15,915) as well as 1,017 apprentic-
es (December 31, 2022: 926)."
"Of these, 3,825 employees and 
385 trainees belong to the Care segment and 52 employees

"Diversity and Equal Opportunities
Our workforce at ­
Vonovia is as diverse and international as 
our tenants: While people from over 145 nations have found 
a home in our apartments and neighborhoods, our Group as 
a whole employs people from over 85 different countries."
"They represent many different age groups, religions and 
world views, have a variety of physical disabilities, come 
from varying socio-economic backgrounds, and live their 
lives with a range of gender identities and sexual orienta-
tions."
"We regard this diversity as a great strength and opportuni-
ty, which we support in a targeted manner and whose 
potential and competitive advantages we aim to harness."
"If, 
on the other hand, we fail to adequately meet the growing 
diversity demands of our increasingly diverse workforce, we 
risk falling behind in the competition for skilled workers and 
not being able to retain existing employees in the long term."
"As a result, we have incorporated this risk into our risk 
management system and review it at regular intervals in the 
context of current developments."
"We currently measure the 
risk of not meeting diversity requirements as having only a 
low potential amount of loss and a very low probability of 
occurrence (<5%)."
"Since this year, a new e-learning 
session on “Recognizing and reducing prejudices and 
stereotypes” has been available to all employees free of 
charge."
"We see the strengthening of women in the company as a 
special mission, as they – chiefly due to the technical occu-
pations in the field of skilled trades – are considerably 
underrepresented with a share of 29% of the workforce as a 
whole (excluding SYNVIA)."
"When setting the target – 30% 
by 2026 – we were guided by the representation of women in 
the Group as a whole."
"In Austria, we were awarded the 
equalitA certification for the internal promotion of women 
in 2021 and it remains valid to this day."
"BUWOG has also 
held state certification as a family-friendly company 
since 2017, being most recently recertified in the 2023 
reporting year."

"In 
addition, until further notice, all new appointments at the 
first and second management levels below the Management 
Board will have to be approved by the Chief Human Resourc-
es Officer as a mandatory requirement."
"The gradual harmonization of social or non-salary benefits 
aims to ensure corresponding equal rights for all employees."
"For example, our employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) 
and a works agreement on mobile working are also in place 
in Austria."
"Following the introduction of a new, standardized 
company pension scheme in 2021, this offer is also available 
to all ­
Vonovia employees in Germany (including ­
Deutsche 
­
Wohnen, excluding SYNVIA and the Care segment)."
"Recon-
ciling one’s family life and professional life is another import-
ant issue at BUWOG in Austria, which offers its employees 
a variety of ways to achieve work-life balance."

friendly company by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Labor, 
Family and Youth."

"Establishment in the Company
The new Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) role 
created in the reporting year has been responsible, since 
October 1, 2023, for ­
Vonovia’s human resources work."
"The 
latter has been established centrally as a shared service 
within the HR department."
"In 2021, the shared services 
approach was transformed into an HR business partner 
model, which is further developed on an ongoing basis."
"Since 
the 2023 reporting year, this has also included the ­
Deutsche 
­
Wohnen subgroup."
Austria and Sweden have their own HR departments.
"Austria reports to the HR department in Germany in func-
tional terms, whereas Sweden is still not firmly established 
in the reporting line."
"Here, monitoring and reporting takes 
place as and when required."
"The Head of HR discusses 
developments with the CHRO on a regular basis."
"The 
objectives and focus of HR work are developed in collabora-
tion with the Management Board and are then cascaded 
down throughout the organization."

Combating Corruption and Bribery
Within the context of the statutory requirements in the 
Non-financial Group Declaration, this aspect includes one 
material topic: “Governance and Compliance” (see 
 
Materiality Matrix)."
"Governance and Compliance
The foundation of our business model is based on reliable, 
transparent and trustworthy corporate governance, which 
the company manages and monitors responsibly and 
independently."
"Its function as a role model is decisive in 
terms of building and cementing credibility – and therefore 
trust among our stakeholders."
"As a result, our governance 
endeavors are geared toward the establishment and imple-
mentation of, and systematic compliance with, a transparent 
and modern system of rules."
"Group-wide policies and 
business principles serve as a framework: Our  Business 
Philosophy, our  Code of Conduct, the  Business Partner Code and 
the  Declaration of Respect for Human Rights act as the maxims 
guiding us in our actions."
"We live up to this attitude with our 
independent Supervisory Board and our commitment to the 
principles of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"In order to acknowledge the increasing significance of 
compliance topics, the existing Compliance office became 
an independent Compliance and Data Protection depart-
ment in April 2023."
"The role of Chief Compliance Officer, 
reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer at least once 
a month, was created to head the department."
"In the report-
ing year, preparations were also made to establish an 
additional decentralized compliance structure from 2024."
"In 
relevant business areas, individual employees are being 
trained as local contacts for compliance issues in order to be 
able to answer initial questions directly on location and 
provide quick and straightforward support."
"The Compliance 
and Data Protection department is training the local con-
tacts, providing technical advice and is maintaining constant 
contact with them."
"The
 compliance management system (CMS) supports the 
corporate governance’s direction and guards the company 
against misconduct."
"At ­
Vonovia, the CMS is based on three 
pillars: prevention, detection and response."
"These pillars are 
underpinned by an extensive system of measures and 
processes as part of the compliance program."
"The basis 
takes the form of the Compliance Guidelines, which follow 
the Principles for the Proper Performance of Reasonable 
Assurance Engagements Relating to Compliance Manage-
ment Systems (IDW PS 980)."
"The CMS is subject to a 
periodic audit, which is carried out by an external auditor."
"Preparations were made in the reporting year for the exter-
nal CMS certification, which will be completed in 2024."
"The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible for imple-
mentation of the CMS."
"In this context, the Chief Compliance Officer 
acts as a central contact point within the company for 
compliance-related questions and suspicions."
"The Chief 
Compliance Officer’s activities are supported by the compli-
ance managers and specialists in the individual depart-
ments."
"The Supervisory Board receives comprehensive 
information about compliance issues and corruption along 
with existing guidelines and processes on a quarterly basis."
"The compliance report, which is forwarded to the Audit 
Committee via the Chief Compliance Officer (following prior 
consultation with the CEO), provides information about 
potential breaches, measures and compliance training, as 
well as relevant data protection issues."
"The CMS and whistleblowing system apply to the entire 
Group."
"­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen also maintains its own legal and 
compliance department, which is supported by ­
Vonovia’s 
Compliance and Data Protection department under the 
terms of the agency agreements."
"Whenever legislation in 
Austria or Sweden conflicts with Group-wide rules, a differ-
ent rule is adopted for the subgroup in the form of a national 
guideline."
"Responsibility for this lies with the respective 
managing directors."
"­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen already had its own 
established CMS for the Care segment, including a data 
protection concept that was tailored to, and appropriate for, 
this business area, which is why the decision was made to 
keep it in place."
"This also applies to the Care segment’s own 
whistleblower channel."
"Access to ­
Vonovia’s whistleblower 
system was also expanded by setting up an additional 
category for the Care segment."
"Regular Group-wide training sessions are the cornerstone 
for preventing misconduct before it happens."
"A comprehen-
sive catalog of regular and mandatory training events is 
already firmly established and has been adapted for the 
various internal target groups."
"The compliance training 
program includes mandatory training on topics such as data 
protection, dealing with conflicts of interest, and combating 
corruption."
"The sessions are aimed at all employees with 
annual refreshers."
"The target group-specific training ses-
sions are also run every year: The procurement department, 
for which the issue is particularly relevant, receives special 
training on corruption and criminal law pertaining to corrup-
tion, for example."
"Sales employees take part in anti-money 
laundering training, while employees in Development receive 
special training on concluding sales contracts."
"Another 
mandatory training course for the entire management level 
is dedicated to the topic of corruption and detecting fraud."
"Non-financial Group Declaration
Combined Management Report —

In the 2023 fiscal year, we once again carried out a compli-
ance risk analysis at the level of senior company executives 
in Germany."
"As part of this analysis, information was re-
quested on the topics of active and passive corruption, 
money laundering, social compliance and IT/data security."
"In 
order to meet the requirements under the German Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act, the analysis and evaluation of 
human rights and environmental risks in the company’s own 
business area was also incorporated into the survey."
"These 
results are also being incorporated into the update of the 
Declaration of Respect for Human Rights."
"The aim of the 
survey was to systematically evaluate compliance risks and 
identify potential areas of focus for further development of 
the CMS."
"The compliance management team decided to 
implement a number of measures on the basis of their 
responses to the survey: Going forward, the frequency of the 
compliance risk analysis will be adjusted from every two 
years to every year, and will also include Austria and Sweden 
on a regular basis."
"In the reporting year, preparations were 
also made for the introduction of annual compliance self-­
assessments in the individual departments within the Group 
starting in 2024."
"The reporting year saw an update to the  Business Partner 
Code, in which ­
Vonovia sets out clear expectations of its 
business partners, including with regard to respecting 
human rights and protecting the environment."
"We expect 
our business partners to subject their own business partners 
at all stages in their supply chain to the obligation to comply 
with the same standards and principles."
"The Group-wide 
Guidelines on the Whistleblower System and the Group-
wide Guidelines on Approval Thresholds and Decision-­
Making Powers were also updated."
"In the 2024 fiscal year, 
the Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines will also be reviewed 
to identify any need for updates, and further preventive 
measures will be implemented in this area."
"Furthermore, 
process digitalization continued in the reporting year and 
preparations were made to introduce a fully digital file 
management system as of 2024."
"­
Vonovia has a comprehensive system in place for com-
plaints management and protecting whistleblowers that is 
also intended to meet the requirements of the Whistleblow-
er Protection Act (Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz), which came 
into force in the reporting year."
"The anonymous whistleblow-
er portal is available not only to employees, but also to 
external groups, such as customers and business partners."
"In the reporting year, six additional languages were added in 
addition to German and English."
"The portal complements 
and extends the existing system of the independent 
ombuds­
person and has been integrated into the ­
Vonovia 
partner portal."
"The whistleblower report, prepared externally 
every six months, is included with the company’s compli-
ance report."
"In Germa-
ny, this covers four European anti-discrimination directives 
that have been issued since 2000."
"Suspected cases of 
discrimination in the process involved in initiating tenancies 
can be reported via the anonymous whistleblower portal, to 
the independent ombudsperson or directly to the Compli-
ance and Data Protection department."

A case of corruption is considered proven if a court conviction has taken place."
"Suspected 
cases of corruption under investigation during the reporting period are not included."
"In the 2023 reporting year, 29 suspected cases of corruption 
or compliance issues in Germany and Austria had been 
reported via the anonymous whistleblower portal and 
carefully investigated."
"The severity of all reported cases was 
determined to be minor."
"One report 
involved a possible violation of human rights within 
­
Vonovia’s own business area, which was not confirmed."
"In 
Sweden, seven reports were received via the various report-
ing channels in the reporting year."
"None of the suspected 
cases in Germany, Austria or Sweden led to a court convic-
tion."
"There were no proven cases of corruption, including in 
the Care segment."
"This currently (up to the editorial deadline) also applies to 
the suspected cases in connection with the search conduct-
ed by the public prosecutor’s office."
"As reported, on March 7, 
2023, ­
Vonovia was informed by the public prosecutor’s office 
in Bochum during the course of necessary search measures 
connected to an ongoing investigation that former and, at 
that time, current technical employees were being investi-
gated on suspicion of corruption."
"The persons under suspi-
cion may also have caused damage for ­
Vonovia by overrid-
ing and circumventing controls and compliance policies."
"­
Vonovia continues to cooperate fully with the work of the 
investigating authorities."
"The auditing firm Deloitte and the 
law firm Hengeler Mueller have been commissioned to 
perform a forensic assessment of all the facts of the case."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023

It is currently not possible to arrive at any conclusive assess-
ment regarding the amount of any damages."
"For 2022, 
it is estimated to come to a maximum of 1% of the order 
volume awarded by ­
Vonovia."
"At the most, this amounts to a 
low single-digit million amount."
"Given that only fully com-
pleted proceedings are presented under material perfor-
mance indicator “Total number of confirmed cases of 
corruption (in Germany)” in the reporting year in question, 
this incident has no impact on the key figures reported."
"Respect for Human Rights
The European legal framework in which ­
Vonovia operates 
with its business model is strictly regulated and overseen in 
the markets in Germany, Austria and Sweden."
"This applies in 
particular to fundamentally enshrined human rights, to 
which ­
Vonovia attaches great importance irrespective of the 
legal framework."
"Compliance with, and the fostering of, 
these rights is reflected in our ethos and mission statement."
"We regularly scrutinize our guidelines and adapt them to 
reflect changing overall conditions."
"Due to the Supply Chain 
Due Diligence Act and the announced European regulation, 
the way in which supply chains are structured and the due 
diligence obligations associated with this are of increasing 
importance to the company."
"In our
 Declaration of Respect for Human Rights, which applies 
throughout the Group, we communicate our clear conviction 
for a pluralistic democratic society and zero tolerance of 
human rights violations and our commitment to respect 
human rights in all aspects of our business."
"We adhere to 
the core labor standards of the International Labour Organi-
zation (ILO), the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights, and the principles of the UN Global Compact, 
which we committed to in 2020."
"Our Code of Conduct also 
takes account of our stance regarding respect for human 
rights."
"­
Vonovia’s business model includes the construction, mainte-
nance and modernization of homes."
"From a human rights 
perspective, compliance with labor and social standards on 
construction sites in the course of these activities is of 
particular relevance."
"Some trade/construction activities in 
Germany are carried out by the company’s own technical 
service – and therefore by its own employees."
"This lessens 
both dependency on the services of external construction 
companies and – thanks to the measures established in the 
company’s own business area – the risk of noncompliance 
with labor and social standards."
"The
 Business Partner Code must be signed prior 
to the conclusion of a contract."
"It is updated 
regularly – most recently in 2023 – and applies for contractu-
al relations in Germany and Austria."
"A corresponding 
separate Business Partner Code is in place in Sweden and 
was also updated in the reporting year."
"Restructuring mea-
sures meant that the procurement department was assigned 
to the Chief Financial Officer’s division in the reporting year."
"As part of the regular evaluation of our major suppliers and 
contractors via our partner portal, we strive to ensure that 
the criteria stated in the Business Partner Code are complied 
with."
"In the event of incidents and breaches, a structured 
management of measures is activated, which – once all 
other means have been exhausted – may result in blocks on 
orders or termination of contract."
"We also use long-term 
cooperation in the spirit of partnership to build a close 
relationship of trust with our contractual partners."
"This is 
largely the responsibility of the procurement department 
and allows any misconduct to be addressed."
"In Germany, 
contractual conclusion is preceded by an automatic check 
against EU sanctions lists, with the compliance department 
informed immediately in the event of a hit."
"In Austria, the 
procurement department reviews all new creditors and regu-
larly reviews existing ones on a half-yearly basis as part of a 
compliance check that also includes an inspection of sanc-
tions lists (via KSV1870)."
"The procurement department in 
Austria also implemented a partner portal for suppliers and 
service providers in the reporting year."
"The portal is based 
on its German counterpart and has been adapted to reflect 
national standards."
"Furthermore, we addressed the requirements of the Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act, which has been applicable in 
Germany since January 1, 2023."
"In the reporting year, we 
completed a comprehensive risk analysis for our own 
business area and for our supply chain to identify priority 
risk areas and develop corresponding measures."
"We de-
scribe our approach to risk analysis and the risk areas in our 
Declaration of Respect for Human Rights."
"We have also 
implemented regular online training courses for employees 
who come into contact with human rights or environmental 
risks as part of their work within ­
Vonovia‘s own business 
area or along the supply chain."
"We also conducted specific 
workshops for our procurement employees in relevant 
business areas in order to further improve awareness of our 
human rights and environmental due diligence obligations."
"We initiated a comprehensive supplier survey to further

boost transparency regarding activities in the supply chain 
and dialogue with our business partners."
"The Chief Compliance Officer is also our company’s Human 
Rights Officer and reports to the Management Board at least 
once a month."
"He is supported by a committee that brings 
together due diligence coordinators from relevant depart-
ments, namely Procurement, Compliance and Data Protec-
tion, Sustainability/Strategy and HR."
"The committee con-
vened four times in the reporting year and discussed the 
ongoing fulfillment of ­
Vonovia’s human rights and environ-
mental due diligence obligations."
"­
Vonovia has set up various 
procedures to allow potential abuses (such as human rights 
violations, environmental pollution, other unlawful actions) 
to be reported by both internal and external parties (see 
 Combating Corruption and Bribery)."
"We conduct in-depth 
investigations into indications of human rights violations 
within our own business area or in the supply chain that 
come to our attention via the various reporting channels."
"No 
reports of breaches of our human rights due diligence 
obligations were confirmed in the reporting year."
"Appeal on the Capital Market
Inflation, interest rates and views on possible recession 
scenarios continued to dominate the international capital 
markets in 2023."
"­
Vonovia’s shares also benefited from the 
improved macroeconomic environment, gaining 29.6% over 
the course of the year."
"All in all, we nevertheless observed a 
widening gap between capital market expectations on the 
one hand, and ongoing robust development on the residen-
tial real estate market on the other (see
 ­
Vonovia SE on the 
Capital Market)."
"The construction and management of residential real estate 
is a business with a long-term focus."
"Our aim in this seg-
ment is to bring economic activity hand in hand with envi-
ronmental benefit, living up to the various expectations of 
stakeholders."
"It is important to us to provide relevant 
information on our company and our economic development 
as well as on the sustainable direction of ­
Vonovia, thereby 
providing an accurate picture of ­
Vonovia."
"We want to 
generate attractive risk-adjusted rates of return for our 
investors and achieve sustainable revenue and value in-
creases."
"This strengthens trust in the ­
Vonovia brand."
"We are committed to both the principles of the social 
market economy and the imperative of profitability."
"Econom-
ic success is the prerequisite for further investments in 
environmental and social sustainability."
"At the same time, 
we firmly believe that these investments also pay off in 
terms of our appeal for investors."
"This is substantiated by 
the growing demand for sustainable financial products and 
the ever greater establishment of ESG criteria as a basis for 
investment decisions."
"Our sustainable bonds, seven of which we 
placed successfully on the capital market in 2022, meet the 
demand for both green and social bonds – and play a crucial 
role in our financing strategy."
"In 2023, we also raised equity 
by selling minority interests."
"These joint ventures have given 
us access to equity in a manner that is much more cost-­
effective than implementing capital increases via the stock 
exchange."
"The European Union Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regula-
tion (SFDR) is aimed at providers of financial products and 
financial advisers such as banks, asset managers, institu-
tional investors and insurance companies."
"Under the SFDR, 
these groups are required to align their products, processes 
and strategies with ESG guidelines."
"We have made our 
Sustainable Finance Framework – which has applied since 
February 2022 – consistent with the EU taxonomy, which 
was confirmed by an independent third party in a Second 
Party Opinion (SPO)."
"All green bonds that we issue under 
this framework are environmentally sustainable as defined in 
the EU taxonomy (environmental objective 1 – climate 
change mitigation)."
"With our
 Sustainable Finance Framework, we have also laid the 
foundation for the definition and selection of social assets in 
the real estate sector on the Swedish market."
"The eligible 
properties are located in “particularly vulnerable,” “high-risk” 
and “vulnerable” areas identified by the Swedish police, in 
which ­
Vonovia has also launched initiatives to promote 
integration and reduce unemployment among its tenants."
"The criteria we selected in this context have already been 
adopted by at least three other issuers on the market."
"We have published our Sustainable Finance Framework, the 
annual impact report evaluating the effectiveness of our 
measures and further information about our sustainable 
financing strategy on our 
 Group website."
"Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO) are responsible for our capital market activi-
ties."
"The Investor Relations department and the Sustainabili-

ty/Strategy department report to the CEO."
"The Corporate 
Finance and Treasury department, which is responsible for 
the implementation of our financial instruments, reports to 
the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)."
"The Head of Corporate 
Finance and Treasury chairs the Sustainable Finance Com-
mittee, which comprises representatives from several 
different departments and is responsible for managing and 
further developing our sustainable financing activities."
"The 
Sustainability/Strategy department is responsible for our 
participation in ESG ratings, involving the operating depart-
ments in this process."
"Involving our stakeholders on the capital market is handled 
by the Investor Relations (IR) division in close consultation 
with the Management Board."
"Transparency is the watch-
word here."
"Through formats such as investor conferences 
and roadshows, we seek out dialogue – including and 
especially on ESG topics – with our shareholders and poten-
tial investors."
"Face-to-face conversations, additional proper-
ty tours and the participation in conferences for private 
investors represent additional communication channels."
"At the same time, IR acts in an inward-facing way so that the 
topics communicated to us by capital market actors come to 
the attention of the right people within the company."
"Sustainability ratings and indices serve as valuable indica-
tors of our sustainability performance and key sources of 
information for the capital market to help with investment 
decisions."
"As a result, they are a top priority at ­

­
Vonovia Development Under the BUWOG Brand Name
It is under the BUWOG brand that ­
Vonovia’s Development 
business area has become firmly established, primarily in 
Vienna and Berlin."
"The regional distribution of the development activities 
covers the whole of Germany with a focus on the Berlin, 
Rhine-Main, Dresden/Leipzig, Hamburg, Stuttgart and 
Munich regions."
The focal region in Austria is Vienna.
"BUWOG provides ­
Vonovia with a development platform 
spanning the entire value chain – from the purchase of land 
to its development, project planning, construction and sale."
"With its substantial product pipeline of residential construc-
tion projects that are currently being built, planned or 
prepared, ­
Vonovia, with the BUWOG brand, ranks among 
Germany’s leading building contractors and is the most 
active private building contractor in Austria."
"As a major player in the residential real estate segment, 
­
Vonovia seeks to use its property development expertise to 
offer targeted solutions in response to current challenges 
such as the shortage of housing, climate change, integration 
and cross-generational housing."
"The development business 
allows ­
Vonovia to provide answers to the challenges result-
ing from megatrends."
"In the 2022 fiscal year, ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen’s development 
activities were integrated into BUWOG’s structures on the 
basis of an agency agreement."
"­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen’s motiva-
tion was to benefit from BUWOG’s development platform 
and expertise in particular, as well as leveraging harmoniza-
tion effects and economies of scale."
"With the skills of the two companies now bundled and the 
options available for exploiting synergy potential on both 
sides, the challenges facing the residential real estate market 
in terms of new construction can be mastered more quickly 
and efficiently."
"The range of products for value creation ranges from the 
sale of individual new-build condominiums in the context of 
development projects to new construction projects on land 
purchased, and land already held, for the company’s own 
portfolio and global sales of large-scale projects to investors."
"Conceptual and technical solutions for the resource-light 
construction and sustainable operation of neighborhoods 
make up a key component of the development business 
model."
"In line with the three focal issues of urbanization, 
energy efficiency and demographic change, central aspects 
of sustainability are already taken into account in the early 
stages of project development."
"Sustainability is achieved at all stages in the residential real 
estate value chain – from the selection of ecological and 
recyclable building materials, to the commissioning of local 
craftsmen and service providers, and the sustainable opera-
tion of the development projects."
"Certification is important to ensure that potential improve-
ments can be made back at the planning stage on the basis 
of criteria for ecological, social and economic sustainability 
and managed during the construction process."

"The strategy of incorporating process steps into the compa-
ny’s own value chain allows ­
Vonovia to provide stringent and 
targeted support to residential construction projects and to 
exploit cost synergies with regard to technical solutions and 
the pooling of procurement volumes."
"Being able to cover the 
entire real estate development value chain internally makes 
the company more efficient and, as a result, more profitable."
"In the Development segment, we make a distinction be-
tween two different areas:
 
> Development to sell includes the units that are sold to 
investors or to future owner-occupiers directly."
"> Development to hold refers to those residential construc-
tion projects whose apartments will be added to ­
Vonovia’s 
rental portfolio upon their completion."
"The prevailing conditions in the residential real estate sector, 
which are characterized by rising construction costs and 
higher interest rates, are changing the demands that real 
estate development projects have to meet in terms of 
profitability and financing."
"With this in mind, projects are 
analyzed with regard to their allocation to the two different 
areas of development, and are reallocated if necessary."
"Based on these profitability criteria and internal financing 
requirements, the Potsdam-Krampnitz project was partially 
reallocated from the “to hold” portfolio to the “to sell” 
portfolio in 2023."
"This reallocation involves a total of 859 
units and a project volume of € 481.6 million."
"As of December 31, 2023, there were 20,416 residential units 
in the “to sell” development portfolio, 4,998 of which 
related to projects under construction, 1,173 to projects from 
the short-term pipeline and 14,245 to projects from the 
medium-term pipeline."
"The share attributable to project 
development in Germany came to 17,755 units (4,998 of 
which related to projects under construction, 600 to projects 
from the short-term pipeline and 12,157 to projects from the 
medium-term pipeline)."
"6,343 units were attributable to 
­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen."
"The share attributable to project devel-
opment in Austria came to 2,661 units (573 units from the 
short-term pipeline and 2,088 from the medium-term 
pipeline)."
"As of December 31, 2023, there were 35,066 residential units 
in the ”Development to hold” portfolio, 1,981 of which 
related to projects under construction, 253 to projects from 
the short-term pipeline and 32,832 to projects from the 
medium-term pipeline."
"The share attributable to Germany 
came to 28,995 units (1,981 units under construction, 253 
units from the short-term pipeline and 26,761 units from the 
medium-term pipeline)."
"The share in Austria came to 3,317

Management Model
The management system tools are geared towards imple-
menting the strategy through our sustainable business 
activities."
"The 2023 fiscal year saw ­
Vonovia break down the strategy 
that had been in place since the IPO further into its key value 
drivers."
"Against the backdrop of the current overall condi-
tions, this process was accompanied by systematic improve-
ments in the capital structure."
"The new value driver ap-
proach is set out and explained in detail under
 “Fundamental 
Information About the Group”."
"At the same time, the ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen Management 
Board subjected the nursing care activities to a strategic 
review."
"The outcome of this process is that the nursing care 
activities will no longer form part of the corporate strategy 
going forward and are to be sold."
"Towards the end of 
the 2023 fiscal year, the nursing care activities were subject-
ed to a market test and were then reported from the fourth 
quarter of 2023 onwards as discontinued operations for the 
purposes of Group reporting."
"This means that the Care 
management segment has been abolished."
"Details can be 
found in the Notes under
 [A2] Adjustment to Prior-year Figures."
"Consequently, ­
Vonovia will manage its business via the four 
segments: Rental, Value-add, Recurring Sales and Develop-
ment."
"The Rental segment combines all of the business activities 
that are aimed at the value-enhancing management of our 
own residential real estate."
"It includes our property manage-
ment activities in Germany, Austria and Sweden."
"The Value-add segment bundles all of the housing-related 
services that we have expanded our core rental business to 
include."
"These services include both the maintenance and 
modernization work on our residential properties and 
services that are closely related to the rental business."
"We 
allocate the activities relating to the craftsmen’s and resi-
dential environment organization, the condominium admin-
istration business, the cable TV business, metering services, 
energy supplies and our insurance services to the Value-add 
segment."
"The Recurring Sales segment includes the regular and 
sustainable disposals of individual condominiums and 
single-family houses from our portfolio."
"Sales of entire buildings, plots of land or larger portfolios 
that are not part of the strategically relevant portfolio (MFH 
Sales/Non Core) are pursued as and when opportunities 
arise, meaning that they are not part of the Recurring Sales 
segment."
"We report these opportunistic sales in the Other 
column of the segment report."
"The Development segment includes project development to 
build new homes."
"This covers the value chain starting with 
the purchase of land without any development plan/dedicat-
ed purpose, to completion and sale (to sell) or integration 
into ­
Vonovia’s own portfolio (to hold)."
"The Development 
segment deals with projects in selected attractive locations."
"We have an integrated Group-wide planning and controlling 
system in place that is based on central performance indica-
tors."
"Based on the medium-term plans derived from our 
strategy, which are subject to an annual review and are 
updated during the year in the event of significant transac-
tions, we prepare a budget for all areas of the Group."
"In the 
course of the fiscal year, current economic developments are 
compared with these targets and the current forecasts on a 
regular basis for all key figures that are relevant to control."
"The business is then steered accordingly in a targeted 
manner, with any necessary countermeasures being initiated 
and tracked."
"We make a distinction between financial and non-financial 
performance indicators."
"Our 2024 management system has a modular structure and 
makes a distinction between performance indicators at 
Group level (most meaningful performance indicators within 
the meaning of DRS 20) and those at segment level."
"As a result, with a view to the future management of the 
company, the Management Board has designed the follow-
ing management system structure."
"Performance Indicators at Group Level as of 2024
Going forward, the IFRS profit for the period will be recon-
ciled to earnings before taxes (EBT), as taxes do not form 
part of operating value added."
"This EBT will be adjusted to reflect special effects based on 
the definition that has applied to date (effects that do not 
relate to the period, recur irregularly or are atypical for 
business operations)."
"The net financial result is also adjust-
ed to reflect non-cash and actuarial valuation effects that 
recur irregularly."
"Adjusted EBT will be 
the leading indicator of profitability."
"The adjusted net financial result, interim profits and depreci-
ation and amortization will be added to the Adjusted EBT to 
produce the Adjusted EBITDA Total as a reconciliation to 
the total segment results."
"Depreciation and amortiza-
tion will be added to Adjusted EBT, and the liquidity contri-
bution made by the Recurring Sales segment, as well as the 
change in working capital, will be taken into account."
"Capi-
talized maintenance and dividend payments made to parties 
outside of the Group, as well as income tax paid, are sub-
tracted from this figure."
"This operating free cash flow is a 
measure of the Group’s operational capacity to generate 
cash surpluses and, as a result, of its internal financing 
power."
"Other Key Figures at Group Level
At the level of the Group as a whole, the EPRA Net Tangible 
Assets (EPRA NTA) per share and the Sustainability Perfor-
mance Index (SPI) are our most meaningful performance 
indicators."
"The EPRA Net Tangible Assets (EPRA NTA) is used to 
review how the company’s value is developing."
"Our calcula-
tions are based on the best practice recommendations of the 
EPRA (European Public Real Estate Association)."

Our business activities are aimed at protecting the environ-
ment, ensuring trustworthy, transparent and reliable corpo-
rate governance and taking social responsibility for our 
customers and employees."
"Each component is assigned an individual factor and a 
defined annual target amount."
"The weighted targets add up 
to a target of 100% that we aim to achieve every year."
"In the 
reporting on the levels of the individual indicators within the 
Non-financial Group Declaration, the business activities of 
­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen are included (excluding the Care seg-
ment), unless otherwise stated."
"Performance Indicators at Segment Level
The main key performance indicator at segment level remains 
Adjusted EBITDA."
"The Adjusted EBITDA Total reported at 
Group level is calculated, in turn, as the sum total of the 
Adjusted EBITDA figures for our segments."
"This means that 
Adjusted EBITDA forms the basis for the operational manage-
ment of the four continuing segments after adjustments to 
reflect effects that do not relate to the period, recur irregularly 
or are atypical for business operations."
"It can be broken 
down into three central components: Rental segment 
revenue, expenses for maintenance and operating expenses 
in the Rental segment."
"The latter include all expenses and 
income that do not relate to expenses for maintenance or 
rental income in the Rental segment."
"The monthly 
in-place rent per m2 gives information on the average rental 
income from the portfolio as of the relevant reporting date."
"In addition to our operational earnings power, investments 
(modernization and new construction work) are decisive for 
the further development of our company."

We manage business activities in the Value-add segment 
using the Adjusted EBITDA Value-add."
"We measure the success of the Recurring Sales segment 
using Adjusted EBITDA Recurring Sales."
"The Adjusted 
EBITDA Recurring Sales compares the proceeds generated 
from the privatization business with the fair values of 
properties sold and the related costs of sale."
"In order to 
disclose profit and revenue in the period in which they are 
incurred and to report a sales margin, the fair value of 
properties sold, valued in accordance with IFRS 5, has to be 
adjusted to reflect realized/unrealized changes in value."
"The Adjusted EBITDA Development includes the gross 
profit from the development activities of “to sell” projects 
(income from sold development projects less production 
costs) less the operating expenses from the Development 
segment."
"The Adjusted EBITDA Total is calculated as the sum total of 
the Adjusted EBITDA figures for our four segments (con-
tinuing operations)."
"It expresses the overall performance of 
our sustainable operating business before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortization."
"The key financial figures shown here are known as “non-
GAAP” measures or alternative performance measures 
(APMs), i.e., key figures which cannot be taken directly from 
the figures in the consolidated financial statements accord-
ing to IFRS."
"The financial performance indicators can, 
however, all be reconciled to the closest-possible key figure 
in the consolidated financial statements, or can be taken 
directly from the IFRS consolidated financial statements in 
the reconciliation."
"Performance Indicators for 2023
The previous management system was continued until the 
end of the fourth quarter of 2023 as presented in the 2022 
Annual Report."
"Group FFO
Group FFO was still the key figure used for managing the 
sustained operational earnings power of our business 
in 2023."
"In the future, it will replaced by Adjusted EBT."
"The Sustainability Performance Index and the EPRA NTA per 
share also applied at Group level in 2023."
"At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, the presentation of 
Development to hold was adjusted within the Development 
segment."
"Details are set out in the Notes under Adjustment 
to Prior-year Figures."
"In the future, all earnings contributions 
made by Development to hold will be recognized in the 
valuation results, i.e., outside of Adjusted EBITDA."
"This 
brings the management approach into the IFRS standard 
governing the measurement of investment properties 
(IAS 40)."

Report on Economic Position
Key Events During the Reporting Period
The 2023 fiscal year was characterized by challenging 
overall conditions in the residential real estate sector."
"On the 
one hand, the ongoing shortage of housing pushed rents up, 
while on the other, it proved impossible to close the macro­
economic supply gap due to restrained new construction 
activity."
"There was a very low volume of transactions on the 
market in 2023, not including ­
Vonovia’s transactions."
"Higher interest rates and inflation also had clear effects on 
the assessment of business models and the valuation of 
assets, in particular holdings measured at fair value and 
goodwill."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, total value adjustments of around 
€ 10.7 billion were recognized for investment properties at 
­
Vonovia."
"The value of the investment properties as of 
December 31, 2023, adjusted to reflect investments, amounts 
to around € 81.1 billion."
"As impairment losses were recog-
nized on goodwill and trademark rights in the fiscal year, 
only the Value-add cash generating unit still reported 
goodwill in the amount of € 1.4 billion as of Decem-
ber 31, 2023."
"As a result, the capital structure and capital allocation were 
the main focal points of the management system due to the 
changes in return requirements and the interest rate envi-
ronment."
"Strengthening the company’s internal financing 
was another priority issue."
"Despite the sluggish transaction market, ­
Vonovia success-
fully strengthened its capital structure in the 2023 fiscal year 
with two joint ventures and two block transactions."
"The investment vehicle is financed by holding 
companies, insurers and other long-term investors that are 
advised and managed by Apollo Capital Management L.P."
The net consideration amounted to around € 1.0 billion.
"The 
transaction was closed in the second quarter of 2023."
"In the fourth quarter (contract signed on October 27, 2023), 
­
Vonovia also reached an agreement with an investment 
vehicle that is advised and managed by Apollo Capital 
Management L.P."
in respect of an equity holding of approx.
"30% in a selected portfolio comprising around 31,000 resi-
dential units in northern Germany."
"The investment vehicle is 
financed by holding companies, insurers and other long-
term investors that are advised and managed by Apollo Cap-
ital Management L.P."
"The net consideration amounted to 
around € 1.0 billion."
"The transaction was closed on Decem-
ber 31, 2023."
"On May 4, 2023, ­
Vonovia and ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen reached an 
agreement with funds managed by CBRE Investment Man-
agement on the sale of five properties in Berlin, Munich and 
Frankfurt with a total of 1,350 apartments and a purchase 
price of around € 560 million."
"The properties were three 
newly constructed properties belonging to the company’s 
old stock and two new construction projects that were in the 
final phase of construction."
"The share deal component was 
closed on May 31, 2023."
"On November 3, 2023, another transaction was announced 
as an asset deal involving ­
Vonovia and ­

together with funds managed by CBRE Investment Manage-
ment regarding new construction projects with a volume of 
€ 357 million."
"The transaction had not yet been completed by 
December 31, 2023."
"Transactions in the other sales categories were also imple-
mented successfully."
"One transaction particularly worthy of 
mention is that announced on October 7, 2023 between the 
City of Dresden and ­
Vonovia relating to a total of 1,213 
apartments."
"The package also includes undeveloped land

In the first quarter of 2023, ­
Vonovia had sold its 10% stake in 
the French company Vesta SAS for a net amount of 
€ 95.7 million, marking its withdrawal from the French 
market."
"As part of a strategic review of the Care segment, the 
Management Board of ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen decided to discon-
tinue and sell these operations."
"Endeavors to sell the Care 
segment have since begun and it is expected to have been 
sold before December 2024."
"Accordingly, the majority of the 
Care segment is presented as discontinued operations."
"The high demand for residential real estate, positive rental 
price development and synergies realized as part of the 
merger with ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen promoted positive develop-
ment in our core Rental business in the 2023 fiscal year."
"As of December 31, 2023, ­
Vonovia’s portfolio was virtually 
fully occupied with a vacancy rate of 2.0%."
"The Customer 
Satisfaction Index (CSI) was 0.4 percentage points below 
the value seen in the previous year in the fourth quarter 
of 2023."
"Looking at the average for the year as a whole, 
customer satisfaction was down by 2.4 percentage points 
year-on-year."
"The sustained high customer satisfaction values in the 2023 
fiscal year confirmed our efforts in property management 
and, together with the low vacancy rate, provided a solid 
foundation for our business."
"At the same time, this means 
stable positive cash flows in the long run and, as a result, a 
stable basis for the income from our real estate portfolio."
"The other business segments were negatively affected by 
higher interest rates in the reporting period and by inflation, 
in particular by the marked uptick in construction costs."
"Higher return requirements meant that investment projects 
had to be reanalyzed, reassessed accordingly and repriori-
tized."
"As a result, restraint was exercised with plans to 
launch new projects in particular."
"Requirements related to 
the company’s capital structure and internal financing were 
also, however, key aspects influencing decisions."
"In this 
respect, transactions with a focus on reducing the leverage 
ratio were successfully realized in 2023."
"The higher return requirements, primarily due to higher 
interest rates, also had an impact on potential transaction 
partners and translated into lower sales in the Recurring 
Sales segment and with regard to projects in the develop-
ment to sell area."
"The Adjusted EBITDA Total (continuing operations) came to 
€ 2,583.8 million, a drop of 0.9% as against the prior-year 
figure of € 2,606.1 million."
"At € 2,401.7 million, Adjusted 
EBITDA in the Rental segment was up by 6.5% on the 
previous year’s figure of € 2,254.3 million, while Adjusted 
EBITDA in the other segments fell by 16.7% for Value-add, 
53.1% for Recurring Sales and 85.3% for Development."
"The Annual General Meeting held on May 17, 2023, resolved 
to pay a dividend for the 2022 fiscal year in the amount of 
€ 0.85 per share."
"As in previous years, shareholders were 
offered the option of choosing between being paid the 
dividend in cash or being granted new shares."
"During the 
subscription period, shareholders holding a total of 44.87% 
of the shares carrying dividend rights opted for the scrip 
dividend instead of the cash dividend."
"As a result, 18,795,001 
new shares were issued using the company’s authorized 
capital for a total of € 303,539,266.15."
"The total amount of 
the dividend distributed in cash therefore came to 
€ 372,933,231.30."
"The Annual General Meeting also voted on the election of 
eight Supervisory Board members."
"Dr. Daniela Gerd tom 
Markotten was elected as a new Supervisory Board member."
"As planned, the size of the Supervisory Board was reduced 
from twelve to ten members."
"The Supervisory Board elected 
Clara-Christina Streit as its Chair at its inaugural meeting."
"Effective October 1, 2023, Ruth Werhahn assumed responsi-
bility for ­
Vonovia’s new HR executive division and is now a 
member of the Management Board of ­
Vonovia SE."
"As reported, on March 7, 2023, ­
Vonovia was informed by the 
public prosecutor‘s office in Bochum during the course of 
necessary search measures connected to an ongoing investi-
gation that former and, at that time, current technical 
employees were being investigated on suspicion of corrup-
tion."
"The persons under suspicion may also have caused 
damage for ­
Vonovia by overriding and circumventing con-
trols and compliance policies."
"­
Vonovia continues to cooperate fully with the work of the 
investigating authorities."
"The auditing firm Deloitte and the 
law firm Hengeler Mueller have been commissioned to 
perform a forensic assessment of all the facts of the case."
"It 
is not currently possible to arrive at any conclusive assess-
ment regarding the amount of any damages."
"For 2022, it is 
estimated to come to a maximum of 1% of the order volume 
awarded by ­
Vonovia."
"At the most, this amounts to a low 
single-digit million amount."
"In its fall forecast, the 
Commission expects GDP growth of 0.6% in the EU and in 
the eurozone for 2023."
"Economic activity is expected to 
recover slightly in the future as consumption picks up thanks 
to a continued robust labor market, sustained wage growth 
and a further slowdown in inflation."
"In light of the challeng-
ing underlying conditions, the Federal Statistical Office 
(Destatis) estimates that the German economy shrank by 
0.3% in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 
compared to the previous year."
"According to Destatis, this 
meant that the recovery from the deep slump in the corona-
virus year 2020 was not sustained."
"According to the National 
Institute of Economic Research (NIER), gross domestic 
product in Sweden is estimated to have fallen by 0.2% 
in 2023."
"The Swedish economy is running below capacity 
and the output gap is likely to widen in 2024."
"According to 
the Institute of Economic Research, Austrian GDP is expect-
ed to have contracted by 0.8%."
"The economy is being 
adversely affected by lower real incomes due to inflation and 
a global industrial downturn."
"For 2024, GDP growth of 0.9% 
is forecast for Germany (IfW Kiel), 1.0% for Sweden (Nation-
al Institute of Economic Research, NIER) and 0.9% for 
Austria (Institute of Economic Research, WIFO)."
"According to the German Federal Employment Agency, the 
German labor market also felt the impact of the weak 
economy."
"Unemployment and underemployment (excluding 
short-time work) increased year-on-year."
"However, employ-
ment also increased slightly at the same time."
"The unem-
ployment rate based on the total civilian labor force rose by 
0.4 percentage points to 5.7% on average in 2023."
"The NIER 
estimates the unemployment rate in Sweden at 7.7% in 2023, 
which is approx."
"0.2 percentage points more than in the 
previous year."
"According to national calculations by the 
Austrian Public Employment Service (AMS), the unemploy-
ment rate in Austria was 6.4% and thus 0.1 percentage 
points higher than in the previous year."
"Based on respective 
national definitions, the average unemployment rate expect-
ed in 2024 is 5.8% for Germany (IfW Kiel), 8.4% in Sweden 
(NIER) and 6.4% in Austria (WIFO)."
"Inflation weakened again in 2023, following a noticeable 
increase in 2022 due to pressure associated with the prices 
of energy, food and other raw materials."
"Measured against 
the respective national Consumer Price Indexes (CPI), the 
average inflation rate was likely 5.9% in Germany, 8.5% in 
Sweden and 7.8% in Austria, based on figures from the 
national statistical offices."
"It is expected that the price spikes 
will continue to tail off in 2024 and that inflation will be 
lower."
"Among other things, the declining price trends in 
energy, food and consumer staples are cited as price damp-
eners for Germany, with lower energy and raw material 
prices for Sweden and lower fuel prices for Austria."
"Based on 
respective national definitions, a CPI increase of 2.3% is 
expected for Germany (IfW Kiel), 2.9% for Sweden (National 
Institute of Economic Research) and 4.0% for Austria 
(WIFO)."
"In a quest to make a timely return to its 2% medium-term 
inflation target, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised key 
rates further in several steps in 2023, most recently to 4.50% 
in September 2023."
"According to the IfW Kiel, the cycle of 
interest rate hikes has probably come to an end."
"High 
inflation also prompted the Swedish Riksbank to take further 
steps to lift its policy rate starting at the beginning of the 
year, most recently raising it to 4.00% in September 2023."
"According to the National Institute of Economic Research, 
the policy rate could fall again from summer 2024."
"In this 
overall environment, interest rates for construction in 
Germany, Sweden and Austria were higher on average 
in 2023 than in the previous year."
"In Germany, there were 
signs of a slight decline in interest rates for construction at 
the end of the year."
"The interest rate environment is having an adverse impact 
on the real estate markets."
"The residential property markets 
had already begun to cool down in the course of 2022 and 
the residential investment market is dominated by price 
adjustment processes and low transaction figures."
"Despite 
this, according to Savills, the underlying conditions on the 
housing market in Germany are very attractive from an 
investor’s perspective."
"The correction in prices caused by 
interest rates in the past year is being counteracted by a 
further short-term increase in supply shortages."
"The situa-
tion on the rental apartment market is likely to continue to 
tighten from the tenant perspective, and most owners can 
expect further rental growth."
"According to bulwiengesa, 
demand in this area is also growing due to the shift of 
potential buyers into the rental market."
"Quoted rents contin-
ued to increase across Germany; empirica reports that they 
were 5.7% higher on average over all years of construction in 
the fourth quarter of 2023 (new construction 5.6%) than in 
the same quarter of the previous year."
"According to DB 
Research, new contract rents are expected to grow by 
around 5% in the current year, and rents for existing con-
tracts by around 2.2%."
"According to data supplied by SCB, 
rents in Sweden rose by an average of 4.1% in 2023."
"The 
initial data on rent negotiations for 2024 from “Hem & Hyra,” 
the member magazine published by the Swedish tenants’ 
association (“Hyresgästföreningen”), point towards a further 
sharp rise in rents."
"In Austria, rents (including newly let 
apartments) increased in 2023 compared to the previous 
year by 7.9% according to the Austrian statistical office."
"According to RE/MAX, rents not subject to rent restrictions 
are likely to continue to rise in 2024 due to demand."

The pace of purchase price growth cooled noticeably in 
Germany, Sweden and Austria in 2022."
"The trend towards 
declining prices in Germany generally continued in 2023."
"The 
empirica price index for condominiums (all years of con-
struction) was 5.5% lower in the fourth quarter of 2023 
compared to the same period of the previous year."
"In the 
new construction segment, the price index was up by 0.2% 
year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2023 thanks to a slight 
increase from the mid-point of the year onwards."
"DB Re-
search assumes that the market adjustment will soon be 
complete."
"According to Svensk Mäklarstatistik, prices for 
tenant-owned apartments (Bostadsrätter) in Sweden were 
1.4% higher in December 2023 compared with the same 
month of the previous year."
"However, after a noticeable 
recovery at the start of 2023, prices began to fall again in the 
last quarter of the year."
"Swedbank’s experts expect residen-
tial real estate prices to bottom out in the first half of 2024."
"The values of the current residential real estate price index 
of the Austrian central bank (OeNB) on the basis of new and 
used condominiums and single-family residences show a 
decrease in Austria in the third quarter of 2023 of 2.9% 
compared with the previous year."
"Measured in terms of 
quarter-on-quarter increases, residential property prices fell 
by around 2% in the fourth quarter of 2022."
"In the first to 
third quarters of 2023, the decline was then much more 
moderate at between -0.2% and -0.4%."
"According to RE/
MAX, the price trend for residential property in Austria will 
initially take a downward trajectory in 2024."
"The size of the population in Germany, Sweden and Austria 
is estimated to have risen again in 2023 and is expected to 
increase further."
"There is still a shortage of apartments in 
many large cities and urban areas."
"Construction activity, 
however, is expected to drop."
"The current mix of high 
construction prices and increased interest rates is having a 
noticeable impact."
"The GdW estimates that only 242,000 
apartments will have been completed in Germany in 2023, 
compared to 295,000 in 2022."
"This figure could fall to 
214,000 in 2024."
"The German federal government had set 
itself the goal of building 400,000 new apartments per year 
in Germany."
"According to JLL, the declining volume of new 
construction in years to come will further increase the 
excess demand on the rental apartment markets in particu-
lar."
"Boverket estimates that around 67,000 apartments will 
have to be built every year in Sweden until 2030."
"In 2023, 
only around 60,000 apartments are expected to have been 
completed."
"According to Boverket’s calculations, comple-
tions will fall to around 40,000 apartments in 2024 and 
around 25,000 apartments in 2025."
"This means that the 
additional annual need will not be met."
"According to the 
OeNB, Austria is witnessing the end of a pronounced 
residential construction cycle."
"According to Bank Austria, 
residential construction activity there has addressed the 
marked increase in the demand for homes in recent years."
"The volume of residential construction will shrink signifi-
cantly in 2023 and 2024."
"Although the expected new con-
struction activity should largely meet demand in terms of 
volume, Bank Austria says it remains to be seen whether 
demand will be met in all segments, especially in the afford-
able housing segment."
"Residential construction is in a difficult phase in all three 
countries due to the combination of higher interest rates, 
less favorable financing conditions and increased construc-
tion costs."
"In Germany, the government had also reduced 
new construction subsidies, and it imposed more stringent 
new construction standards at the start of 2023."
"In addition, 
there is uncertainty surrounding housing policy after 
the 2021 supplementary budget was declared unlawful at the 
end of 2023, requiring the renegotiation of the 2024 budget."
"Investment subsidies for rental apartments in Sweden were 
discontinued as of the end of 2022."
"In the current circum-
stances, new construction developments are barely viable in 
commercial terms."
"The German residential investment market was cautious 
in 2023."
"According to CBRE, the transaction volume amount-
ed to € 5.7 billion, 59% lower than in the previous year and 
the lowest transaction volume since 2011."
"The main reasons 
given for this weak development are the difference in price 
expectations between buyers and sellers, as well as the 
uncertainties following the German Buildings Energy Act 
(GEG) and the associated loss of investor confidence."
"According to CBRE, prime yields in the top seven cities have 
risen by almost 80 basis points to 3.34% since the end 
of 2022."
"CBRE expects the residential transaction market to 
pick up in 2024 with an investment volume of around 
€ 8 billion."
"The drivers for this include the ongoing portfolio 
adjustments of listed real estate companies and the refi-
nancing gap of late-cycle investors."
"According to Colliers, 
properties worth € 7.8 billion were traded across all seg-
ments on the Swedish transaction market in 2023, represent-
ing a year-on-year decrease of approx."
"In terms of 
transaction volume, residential properties were the second-­
largest asset class after logistics properties with a share of 
23% (2022: 28%)."
"According to CBRE, the Austrian real 
estate investment market saw a transaction volume of 
approximately € 2.9 billion across all segments in the 2023 
fiscal year, down by around one-third on the previous year."
The share of the residential segment stood at only 9%.
"Housing policy developments in 2023 and at the start 
of 2024 in Germany included changes to the GEG, in which 
the permissible primary energy level for new construction 
was tightened at the start of 2023."
"On January 1, 2024, an 
amendment came into force aimed at increasing the propor-
tion of renewable energies in heating systems and at reduc-
ing emissions."
"Reforms were also made to the Federal 
Funding for Efficient Buildings (BEG): Since the beginning 
of 2023, new conditions have applied for refurbishments to 
achieve energy-efficiency building standards as well as for 
individual measures."
"Since March 1, 2023, funding guidelines 
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023

have been available for climate-friendly new construction, 
with loans available on more favorable terms for environ-
mentally friendly buildings that meet the KfW Efficiency 
House 40 standard."
"However, the funding had been used up 
by December 2023."
"Applications should be possible again 
after the 2024 budget is in force."
"The new BEG – Individual 
Measures Directive also came into force on January 1, 2024."
"This directive promotes the replacement of fossil fuel 
heating systems with climate-friendly ones by subsidizing 
investment costs."
"A law on the division of CO2 costs be-
tween landlord and tenant came into force on January 1, 
2023, and the costs per ton of CO2 emitted increased from 
the start of 2024."
"The straight-line rate for the depreciation 
of residential buildings was increased from 2% to 3% as of 
January 1, 2023 and applies to residential buildings complet-
ed from January 2023."
"A proposed declining balance depre-
ciation for new residential construction as part of the 
German Growth Opportunities Act has been postponed for 
now."
"An agreement reached in December on the reform of 
the EU Buildings Directive provides for, among other things, 
the reduction of energy consumption in residential buildings."
"The EU is waiving the obligation to refurbish poorly insulated 
private residential buildings."
"The agreement still has to be 
formally approved by the respective EU institutions."
"At the 
end of June 2023, an expert commission convened by the 
Berlin Senate came to the conclusion that the socialization 
of major residential real estate companies is possible from a 
legal perspective."
"The Berlin State Government is now 
examining a framework socialization act."
"In Austria, indica-
tive rents were increased as of April 1, 2023, with category-­
based rents being increased effective July 1, 2023."
"From 2024, a rent cap will apply that limits the increase in 
indicative rents, category-based rents and rents for 
non-profit apartments."
"This does not include unrestricted 
rental agreements."
"Group’s Business Development
Business Development in 2023 – An Overview
All in all, our operating business developed in line with our 
expectations in the 2023 fiscal year."
"High demand for homes 
and rising rents supported the operational basis of our 
business, the core Rental segment."
"We invested a total of around € 0.8 billion (2022: € 1.4 billion) 
in our own portfolio for new construction and modernization 
measures in the 2023 fiscal year, and around € 0.7 billion 
(2022: € 0.9 billion) in maintenance."
"We completed 1,309

operations) came to € 5,151.1 million, down by 7.5% on the 
value for the previous year (€ 5,566.2 million)."
"This decline 
was due primarily to lower sales in the Recurring Sales

by 18.5% on the prior-year value of € 57.48."
"The development 
in the net asset value figure was due primarily to the net 
income from fair value adjustments of investment properties 
of € -10,651.2 million in 2023 (2022: € -1,177.6 million)."
"The dis-
tribution of the cash dividend of € 372.9 million in 2023 
(2022: € 672.4 million) and the issue of new shares as part of 
the scrip dividend also had an impact on this key figure."
"The Sustainability Performance Index stood at 111% in 
the 2023 fiscal year (2022: 103%)."
"This was helped along in 
particular by the reduction of CO2 intensity, the develop-
ment of the average primary energy requirements of new 
construction and (partial) modernization measures to make 
apartments fully accessible, and high levels of employee 
satisfaction."
"The ongoing improvements to the property management 
processes and the use of new digital software solutions 
promote ongoing improvement in profitability."

Details on Results of Operations by Segment
Rental Segment
The Rental segment showed positive development overall in 
the 2023 fiscal year."
"At the end of 2023, the portfolio had a 
vacancy rate of 2.0% (end of 2022: 2.0%), meaning that it 
was nearly fully occupied."
"In the 2023 financial year, Rental segment revenue increased 
by 2.1% to € 3,253.4 million (2022: € 3,186.7 million)."
"Organic rent growth (twelve-month rolling) totaled 3.8% 
(3.3% as of December 31, 2022)."
"The current rent increase 
due to market-related factors came to 2.3% (1.0% as of 
December 31, 2022) and the increase from property value 
improvements translated into a further 1.0% (1.6% as of 
December 31, 2022)."
"All in all, this produced a like-for-like 
rent increase of 3.3% (2.6% as of December 31, 2022)."
"New 
construction measures and measures to add extra stories 
also contributed 0.5% (0.7% as of December 31, 2022) to 
organic rent growth."
"The average monthly in-place rent within the Rental seg-
ment at the end of 2023 came to € 7.74 per sqm compared to 
€ 7.49 per sqm as of December 31, 2022."
"The rental income from the portfolio in 
Sweden reflects all-inclusive rents, meaning that the 
amounts contain operating, heating and water supply costs."
"We adapted our modernization, new construction and 
maintenance strategy to reflect the current overall financial 
conditions in the 2023 fiscal year."
"The overview below 
provides details on maintenance, modernization and new 
construction."
"Operating expenses in the Rental segment in the 2023 fiscal 
year were down by 12.9% on the figures for the prior year, 
from € 488.5 million to € 425.5 million."
"This is due primarily 
to synergies achieved and positive one-off effects as part of 
the integration of ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen."
"All in all, the Adjusted 
EBITDA Rental came to € 2,401.7  million in the 2023 fiscal 
year, up by 6.5% on the prior-year value of € 2,254.3 million."
"Value-add Segment
Developments in the Value-add segment were dominated by 
the new overall conditions for our own craftsmen’s organiza-
tion."
"Energy sales, on the 
other hand, developed positively."
"In the Value-add segment, income totaled € 1,224.7 million in 
the 2023 fiscal year, down by 3.7% on the prior-year figure of 
€ 1,272.0 million."
"External revenue from our Value-add 
activities with our end customers rose by 9.4% from 
€ 119.6 million in 2022 to € 130.9 million in 2023."
"This was due

primarily to higher revenue from energy sales."
"Group reve-
nue fell by 5.1% in the 2023 fiscal year from € 1,152.4 million 
in 2022 to € 1,093.8 million."
"This is mainly due to the reduced 
volume of modernization measures in 2023."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, operating expenses in the Value-add 
segment were down by 2.3% on the figures for the prior year, 
from € 1,145.3 million to € 1,119.2 million."
"The Adjusted EBITDA Value-add came to € 105.5 million in 
the 2023 fiscal year, 16.7% below the prior-year figure of 
€ 126.7 million."
"Income of 
€ 214.6 million is attributable to sales in Germany (2022: 
€ 430.8 million) and € 104.7 million to sales in Austria (2022: 
€ 112.6 million)."
"The fair value step-up came in at 33.4% in the 2023 fiscal 
year, down on the prior-year value of 38.8%."
"This was due 
primarily to lower step-ups for sales in Germany."
"Selling costs in the Recurring Sales segment came in at 
€ 16.5 million in 2023, almost on a par with the previous year."
"Adjusted EBITDA Recurring Sales came in at € 63.4 million in 
the 2023 fiscal year, down significantly on the value of 
€ 135.1 million seen in the prior year."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, 2,248 residential units from the Non 
Core/Other portfolio (2022: 17,050) were sold as part of our 
portfolio adjustment measures, with proceeds totaling 
€ 553.7 million (2022: € 2,726.8 million)."
"At 1.1% in 2023, the 
fair value step-up for Non Core/Other was lower than for the 
previous year at 1.7%."
"Development Segment
Economic development in the Development segment was hit 
primarily by the increased construction costs and interest 
rates in the reporting period."
"In the Development to sell area, a total of 1,116 units were 
completed in the 2023 fiscal year (2022: 1,678 units), 760 in 
Germany (2022: 484 ) and 356 in Austria (2022: 1,194 units)."
"The prior-year figures included a 
global exit (Gäblerstrasse)."
"The resulting gross profit from 
Development to sell came to € 47.7 million in the 2023 
financial year with a margin of 13.7% (2022: € 120.2 million, 
margin 21.4%)."
"Development operating expenses came to € 39.6 million in 
the 2023 fiscal year, 17.5% above the prior-year value of 
€ 33.7 million mainly due to non-capitalizable property 
development expenses."
"The Adjusted EBITDA for the Development segment 
amounted to € 13.2 million in the 2023 reporting period 
(2022: € 90.0 million)."
"In the Development to hold area, a total of 1,309 units were 
completed in 2023 (2022: 2,071 units), 839 in Germany 
(2022: 1,338 units), 296 in Austria (2022: 592 units) and 174 
in Sweden (2022: 141 units)."
"Group FFO
Group FFO was down by 9.1% on the previous year’s value of 
€ 1,981.6 million to € 1,801.6 million in the 2023 fiscal year."
This was due first and foremost to higher interest expense.
"The Group FFO interest expense came to € 619.6 million 
in 2023, up by 25.8% on the prior-year value of € 492.6 mil-
lion."
"Current income taxes FFO came in at € 180.3 million 
in 2023, 32.0% higher than in the previous year (€ 136.6 mil-
lion)."
"At € 17.7 million, intragroup losses in 2023 were up on 
the prior-year value of € 4.7 million."
"The Adjusted EBITDA Total (continuing operations) 
amounted to € 2,583.8 million in the 2023 fiscal year (2022: 
€ 2,606.1 million)."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, the non-recurring items eliminated in 
the Adjusted EBITDA Total (continuing operations) came to 
€ 147.9 million (2022: € 127.4 million)."
"The change is mainly 
attributable to positive non-recurring items in the previous 
year, as well as higher expenses for pre-retirement part-time 
work arrangements and one-off effects linked to the ­
Südewo 
transaction in the 2023 reporting period."

"Current assets increased by € 1,522.8 million from 
€ 5,351.7 million to € 6,874.5 million."
"This is due primarily to 
the recognition of the assets attributable to the Care seg-
ment, as a discontinued operation, in the amount of 
€ 770.1 million."
"There were also changes in trade receivables, 
which rose by € 432.2 million, mainly due to higher receiv-
ables from the sale of land, real estate inventories and rent 
receivables."
"As of December 31, 2023, the gross asset value (GAV) of

Vonovia’s property assets came to € 84,545.1 million."
"This 
corresponds to 91.9% of total assets, compared to

"Equity fell by € 4,494.2 million, from € 34,438.8 million to

"In addition to the revaluations performed 
during the year, the entire portfolio was revalued at the end 
of 2023."
"The demand for housing continues to outstrip the supply, 
which had a positive impact on rent development in 2023."
"Our assessment is that this trend will continue in the coming 
years."
"Based on market data, we therefore assume an 
average increase in market rents of 2.7% over the next ten 
years in the valuation of the portfolio."
"The market values of 
our properties are also being helped along by the invest-
ments made in the energy-efficient modernization of our 
buildings and improvements to the fittings in our apart-
ments."
"These positive effects were more than offset by the 
ongoing rise in return expectations among property buyers."
"Overall, the fair value of our real estate portfolio was lower 
than in the previous year and, after adjustments for acquisi-
tions and sales, and excluding currency effects, changed by 
–10.8%."
"In addition to the internal valuation, ­
Vonovia’s residential 
real estate portfolio was also valued by the independent 
property appraisers CBRE GmbH, Jones Lang LaSalle SE and 
Savills Sweden AB."
"The market value resulting from the 
external report was consistent with the internal valuation 
result."
"­
Vonovia’s project developments for subsequent manage-
ment within its own portfolio are measured at acquisition 
and production costs until the construction work is com-
plete as the fair value cannot be reliably calculated on a 
continuing basis particularly in the current environment."
"This is subject to a review of the values applied if triggering 
events occur."
"The fair value for the nursing care properties 
was calculated by the external appraiser W&P Immobilien-
beratung GmbH using a DCF method."
"The fair value of the portfolio of residential properties was 
determined, in accordance with IAS 40 and IFRS 13, on the 
basis of the International Valuation Standard Committee’s 
definition of market value."
"­
Vonovia, in principle, measures its portfolio on the basis of 
the discounted cash flow (DCF) method."
"Under the DCF 
methodology, the expected future income and costs of a 
residential property are forecast and discounted to the date 
of valuation as the net present value."
"The income in the DCF 
model mainly comprises expected rental income (current 
in-place rent, current inclusive rent in Sweden, market rents 
as well as their development) taking vacancy losses and also 
sales revenues for an Austrian subportfolio into account."
"In Sweden, rents and rent increases are defined as part of 
negotiations with the Swedish tenants’ association (“Hyres-
gästföreningen”) and are reflected accordingly in the valua-
tion model."
"The expected sales revenues in Austria are 
derived from historical sale prices as well as market data 
(e."
"g., the Austrian Economic Chamber [WKÖ], EHL)."
"On the cost side, maintenance expenses and administrative 
costs are taken into account."
"Further cost items are, for 
example, ground rents, non-allocable ancillary costs, rent 
losses and, in Austria, selling costs."
"In the Swedish valuation, 
further expenses to be borne by the owner are also taken 
into account in the DCF model due to the inclusive rents that 
are a special feature of this market."
"All cost items are 
inflated in the reporting period."
"Modernization measures 
carried out in the housing stocks are factored in by decreas-
ing the current maintenance expenses and adjusting market 
rents."
"The commercial properties in the portfolio are mainly 
small commercial units for the supply of the local residential 
environment."
"Different cost approaches are used to those 
for residential properties, and the capitalized interest rates 
were adjusted to reflect the market specifics."
"The recognition and valuation of investment properties are 
explained in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements (see
[D28] Investment Properties)."
"Net income from fair value

ment comes to € -10,651.2 million (2022: € -1,177.6  million)."

Vonovia SE performs the function of the management 
holding company within the ­
Vonovia Group."
"In this function, 
it is responsible for determining and pursuing the overall 
strategy and implementing it in the form of the company’s 
goals."
"It performs property management, project develop-
ment, financing, service and coordination tasks for the 
Group."
"Furthermore, it is responsible for the management, 
control and monitoring system as well as risk management."
"To carry out these management functions, ­
Vonovia SE also 
maintains service companies to which it has outsourced 
selected functions, allowing it to realize corresponding 
harmonization and standardization effects, as well as 
economies of scale."
"The description of the company’s net assets, financial 
position and results of operations is based largely on the 
reporting of the ­
Vonovia Group."
"The net assets, financial 
position and results of operations of ­
Vonovia SE as the 
management holding company are ultimately determined by 
the assets of the Group companies and their ability to make 
sustainable positive contributions to earnings and generate 
positive cash flows."
"The company’s risk profile is therefore 
largely the same as the Group’s."
"The preceding reporting for the Group of ­
Vonovia SE there-
fore also expresses the company’s position."
"The ­
Vonovia SE annual financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German 
Commercial Code (HGB) taking into account the supple-
mentary regulations of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG)."
"As a listed company, ­
Vonovia SE is classed as a large 
corporation."
"The annual and consolidated financial statements as well as 
the combined management report are published in the 
electronic business register."
"Business Development in 2023 – An Overview
The residential real estate sector is currently faced with 
complex overall conditions characterized by high demand 
for housing and homes that are in short supply due to an 
insufficient number of real estate development projects."
"Demand is being driven to a considerable degree by migra-
tion and sociological aspects, while supply is being influ-
enced primarily by higher construction costs and interest 
rates."
"Also in light of the current overall conditions, the successful 
strategy defined at the time of the company’s IPO has been 
analyzed to identify the key value drivers and define a more 
targeted management system."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, the foundation was laid for the 
merger of ­
Vonovia Finance B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands, 
with ­
Vonovia SE on a cross-border basis effective Janu-
ary 1, 2024."
"This merger was completed upon entry in the 
Bochum Commercial Register on January 23, 2024."
"The operating rental business of ­
Vonovia SE and its subsid-
iaries went largely as planned, and proved successful, in 
the 2023 fiscal year."
"The results reported by the Develop-
ment, Value-add and Recurring Sales segments were hit by 
the overall conditions described earlier, and fell short of 
expectations."
"In the Group reporting, the nursing care activities are shown 
as discontinued/abandoned operations."
"The 2023 fiscal year was also dominated by refinancing mea-
sures in response to falling market values and rising interest 
rates."
"These refinancing measures were characterized by 
income from block sales and from key joint venture agree-
ments."
"­
Vonovia was able to maintain its investment grade rating 
awarded by the rating agencies S&P and Moody’s."
"S&P 
confirmed the company’s BBB+/A-2 rating, with a stable 
outlook, in a notification dated November 20, 2023."
"In an 
Report on Economic Position
Combined Management Report —
122
announcement dated November 16, 2023, Moody’s awarded 
­
Vonovia an unchanged rating of Baa1 with a stable outlook."
"As a result of the rise in interest rates and increased volatili-
ty on the stock market, there was a further increase in the 
cost of capital, meaning that impairment losses needed to 
be taken on shares in affiliated companies."
"The Annual General Meeting held on May 17, 2023, resolved 
to pay a dividend for the 2022 fiscal year in the amount of 
€ 0.85 per share."
"During the subscription period, sharehold-
ers holding a total of 44.87% of the shares carrying dividend 
rights opted for the scrip dividend instead of the cash 
dividend."
"As a result, 18,795,001 new shares were issued 
using the company’s authorized capital for a total of 
€ 303,539,266.15."
"The total amount of the dividend distribut-
ed in cash therefore came to € 372,933,231.30."
"The Annual General Meeting also voted on the election of 
eight Supervisory Board members."
"Dr. Daniela Gerd tom 
Markotten was elected as a new Supervisory Board member."
"As planned, the size of the Supervisory Board was reduced 
from twelve to ten members."
"The Supervisory Board elected 
Clara-Christina Streit as its Chair at its inaugural meeting."
"Effective October 1, 2023, Ruth Werhahn assumed responsi-
bility for ­
Vonovia’s new HR executive division and is now a 
member of the Management Board of ­
Vonovia SE."
"Helene 
von Roeder had previously left ­
Vonovia with effect from 
June 30, 2023 at her own request."
"Results of Operations of ­
Vonovia SE
The company regularly generates income from the charging 
of the services it provides, from income from investments in 
the form of dividend distributions from Group companies 
and income from the transfer of profits."
"Profit-and-loss 
transfer agreements exist with, among other entities, the 
service companies, which themselves generate income by 
charging the real estate companies for the services they 
have provided."
"The income from investments collected is based on the net 
profit of the subsidiaries that is eligible for distribution, 
which is, in turn, calculated based on the accounting stan-
dards set out in the German Commercial Code."
"The main 
difference between these standards and the IFRS accounting 
principles lies in the fact that, under IFRS accounting, the fair 
value principle has more of an impact than the cost principle 
does under HGB accounting."
"In the consolidated financial statements under IFRS, the 
properties are remeasured at periodic intervals."
"Under HGB, 
the fixed assets are stated at amortized cost, taking depreci-
ation into account."
"The capitalization regulations in particu-
lar also vary."
"Expenses relate largely to personnel and administrative 
expenses associated with the management holding function, 
as well as to losses to be compensated for in connection 
with profit-and-loss transfer agreements."
"The financial result is characterized by group financing, 
impairment losses on non-current financial assets and the 
result from profit-and-loss transfer agreements."
"Impairment losses on the shares in ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen SE 
were reversed in the amount of € 375.8 million following 
hefty impairment losses of € 8.9 billion in the previous year."
"Impairment losses of € 484.1 million had to be recognized on 
shares in other non-current financial assets."
Losses from loss transfers also had an impact of € 1.8 billion.
"The losses in the subsidiaries mainly resulted from value 
adjustments on shares in affiliated companies."
"Business development was also shaped by the assumption 
of the activities performed by ­
Vonovia Finance B.V."
"in 
anticipation of the planned merger, which shifted debt 
financing volumes from ­
Vonovia Finance B.V."
"to ­
Vonovia SE, 
with a knock-on effect on the financial result."
"The 2023 fiscal year was also characterized by the comple-
tion of the process to integrate ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen’s pro-
cesses and systems into the ­
Vonovia platform."
"In order to provide the profit of € 750.0 million, the Manage-
ment Board withdrew € 2,754.1 million from the company’s 
capital reserves, which were worth € 2,898.0 million as of 
December 31, 2023."
"The previous year had also been characterized by expenses 
for impairment losses on shares, as well as integration costs."
"Revenue increased by € 55.9 million from € 178.3 million 
in 2022 to € 234.2 million as a result of the higher fees 
charged under agency agreements due to the incorporation 
of the ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen Group into ­
Vonovia’s system and 
process platform."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
123
Other operating income increased by € 406.0 million 
in 2023, primarily due to the reversal of impairment losses 
on the shares in ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen and book gains from the 
early repayment of bonds as part of a public buyback offer."
"Purchased services, as a key component of the cost of 
materials, increased by € 45.2 million, largely in line with the 
higher fees charged due to an increase in internally pur-
chased services in the context of the integration of the 
­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen Group."
"Personnel expenses fell in 2023 by € 6.3 million due to lower 
additions to retirement benefits and, with the opposite 
effect, higher remuneration for the long-term incentive 
program."
"Other operating expenses fell by € 14.6 million, due predom-
inantly to lower financing costs and lower impairment losses 
on receivables."
"On the other hand, consultancy expenses 
were higher in connection with the integration of ­
Deutsche 
­
Wohnen’s processes and systems."
"Net financial expenses fell from € 9,375.7 million to 
€ 776.7 million."
"In the previous year, the main driver had been 
the impairment losses on the shares in ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen."
"Net interest expenses increased by € 25.1 million as a result 
of the transfer of financing volumes from ­
Vonovia Finance 
B.V."
"The balance of interest with affiliated 
companies came to € 92.9 million as against € 120.9 million 
in the previous year."
"Net interest expenses paid to third 
parties rose by € 53.1 million to € 169.1 million."
"Income from investments in the 2023 fiscal year is in nega-
tive territory at € 1,538.9  million, € 758.9 million lower than 
the prior year’s figure."
"This figure was impacted significantly 
by the result from profit and loss transfers in the amount of 
€ -1,569.9 million, which is also influenced primarily by 
impairment losses on investment carrying amounts and 
book losses."
"Whereas ­
Vonovia reported tax income of € 9.1 million 
in 2022, it reported tax expenses of € 59.7 million in 2023."
"Tax expenses in the year include deferred tax expense of 
€ 25.3 million as tax expense of € 15.2 million for previous 
years."
"­
Vonovia SE closed the 2023 fiscal year with a net loss of 
€ 2,027,621,705.47 (2022: € 10,239,681,551.72 )."
"After offset-
ting this loss for the year against the profit carried forward 
from the previous year of € 23,527,502.55, the Management 
Board withdrew € 2,754,094,202.92 from capital reserves, 
resulting in a net profit for the 2023 fiscal year of 
€ 750,000,000.00."
"Total equity amounts to 
€ 4.5 billion."
"The company’s non-current assets in the amount of 
€ 35,308.5 million (December 31, 2022: € 33,994.7 million) are 
largely characterized by non-current financial assets in the 
amount of € 35,278.2 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 33,969.0 million)."
"The company’s intangible assets and tangible fixed assets 
increased slightly in the normal course of business."
"Shares in affiliated companies increased by € 1,824 million in 
the context of joint venture agreements; by contrast, loans 
to Group companies fell by € 494.5 million."
"Net liabilities comprising bonds, bank loans and liquidity 
increased by € 4,127.0 million due to the shift in volumes 
from ­
Vonovia Finance B.V."
"The Group’s net lending/borrow-
ing position, which comprises receivables from and liabilities 
to affiliated companies as well as company loans resulting 
from the Group financing activity, developed by a total of 
€ 2,520.1 million in favor of ­
Vonovia’s Group companies 
in 2023."
"On January 4, 2022, ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen extended a loan to 
­
Vonovia SE in the amount of € 1,450 million in line with the 
arm’s length principle."
"It had a value of € 320 million as of 
December 31, 2023."
"Provisions came to € 223.3 million at the end of the year 
(December 31, 2022: € 192.5 million), with € 101.4 million 
attributable to provisions for pensions (December 31, 2022: 
€ 98.3 million) and € 54.2 million attributable to tax provisions 
(December 31, 2022: € 38.5 million)."
"The € 11.9 million increase 
in other provisions was mainly due to the pre-­
retirement 
part-time work program and outstanding invoices."
"Total equity had fallen significantly by € 2,400.6 million by 
the end of the fiscal year due to the net loss for the year and 
the cash dividend that was paid out."

"­
Vonovia SE only has appre-
ciable cash flows from investing activities when acquisitions 
are made."

result from changes in Group financing and from the bor-
rowing/repayment of debt financing in the context of the 
Group financing function."
"Employees of ­
Vonovia SE
In the 2023 fiscal year, an average of 159 employees (2022: 
160) were employed at the company, 125 of whom were 
full-time employees and 34 of whom were part-time."
"Opportunities and Risks for ­
Vonovia SE
The likely development of ­
Vonovia SE in the 2023 fiscal year 
depends to a considerable extent on the development of the 
Group as a whole and its opportunity and risk situation."
"The 
most important financial performance indicator for the 
annual financial statements of ­
Vonovia SE is the annual 
result."
"The expenses incurred in connec-
tion with the integration measures also had a negative 
impact on ­
Vonovia SE’s annual result."
"Without taking these special effects into account, the net 
loss for 2023 runs into the mid-double-digit millions, in line 
with the company’s forecast."
"The results for the 2024 fiscal year will in turn be character-
ized by the results of subsidiaries collected/compensated for 
on the basis of income from investments and profit-and-loss 
transfer agreements, income from services, personnel and 
administrative expenses, and the financial result."
"All in all, we expect the company to report a net loss in the 
mid-double-digit million range in the 2024 fiscal year, 
excluding special effects."
"The ongo-
ing improvements to the property management processes, 
the expansion of the Value-add segment, Recurring Sales 
and a value-adding development business promote ongoing 
improvements in profitability and enterprise value."

ments in Germany are complemented by equally positive 
developments in Sweden and Austria."

tion, which is not included in the audit conducted by the 
auditor of the annual financial statements pursuant to 
Section 317 (2) (6) HGB, has been published on the
 Investor 
Relations website and does not form part of the management 
report."
"Corporate governance is the responsible management and 
supervision of a company."
"With balanced corporate governance, the Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board wish to safeguard 
­
Vonovia SE’s competitiveness, strengthen the trust of the 
capital market and the general public in the company and 
sustainably increase the company’s value."
"As a major real estate company, we are aware of the partic-
ular significance of our entrepreneurial actions for society at 
large."
"The Management Board has looked at the appropriateness 
of the internal control system that has been set up and has 
evaluated its effectiveness."
"Among other things, the standards set out in the German 
Corporate Governance Code, based on the most recent 
publications from 2022, serve as the benchmark here."
"Ultimately, the Management Board has no reason to believe 
that the internal control system is not appropriate and 
effective in all key aspects."
"Based on findings from internal or external audits, we make 
continuous improvements to our internal control system."
"Another component of our internal control system is regular 
monitoring, on the basis of which any weak points identified 
are eliminated."
"Any weak points identified in the internal 
control system on the basis of the investigations against 
individuals who are largely former employees, of which 
­
Vonovia was notified on March 7, 2023, will also be eliminat-
ed in a timely manner."
"All shares 
carry the same rights and obligations."
"Each share grants one 
vote at the Annual General Meeting and is decisive for the 
share held by shareholders in the company’s profits."

rights and obligations of the shareholders result in detail

Opportunities and Risks
Risk Management Structure and Instruments
The market environment and the overall statutory/regulato-
ry conditions to which ­
Vonovia is subject are constantly 
changing."
"­
Vonovia is adapting to this environment by 
developing its strategy and, within this context, its business 
activities on an ongoing basis."
"­
Vonovia also reacts to ESG 
influences from a wide variety of stakeholders by adjusting 
its corresponding ESG targets."
"These changes mean that 
additional opportunities and risks arise on a regular basis, 
and that the extent of existing opportunities and risks can 
change at any time."
"As a result, ­
Vonovia has implemented a comprehensive risk 
management system that ensures that all of the risks that 
are relevant to the company (and to the environment and 
society at large) can be identified, evaluated and managed."
"This reduces risk potential, secures the company’s survival, 
supports its strategic further development and promotes 
responsible entrepreneurial action."
"Risks are defined as possible events or developments that 
could have a negative impact on the company’s expected 
economic development and, as a result, could lead to a 
negative deviation from the short-term plans (budget and 
forecasts) and the company’s medium-term plans (five-year 
plan)."
"Any deviations from the company’s ESG objectives 
also pose risks to its economic development."
"Opportunities are 
not quantified for internal management purposes."
"­
Vonovia’s risk management system is based on an integrat-
ed five-pillar risk management approach."
"(1) Performance Management
Detailed corporate planning and appropriate reporting on 
deviations in the operational and financial key figures from 
Controlling constitute the backbone of the early warning 
system used at the company."
"Analyses are made of the 
business performance compared with the plans approved by 
the Supervisory Board and the previous year."
"Furthermore, 
forecasts are prepared regularly which take appropriate 
account of the effect of any potential risks and opportunities 
on the development of business."
"Reporting includes detailed monthly controlling reports for 
the Management Board and the Supervisory Board."
"The 
operational business is described in regular reports on key 
figures, some of which are drawn up on a weekly or daily 
basis."
"On the basis of these reports and the deviations that 
they highlight between the actual and target figures, 
countermeasures are initiated and implemented and then 
checked in subsequent reporting periods to ensure they are 
effective."
"(2) Compliance Management
Compliance means that the company, its bodies and em-
ployees act in line with the applicable rules and regulations."
"For the Management Board, compliance with statutory law 
and the observance of internal guidelines are the basis of 
corporate management and culture."
"Compliance is to ensure 
the integrity of employees, customers and business partners 
and avoid possible negative consequences for the company 
(and for the environment and society at large)."
"The management and monitoring of ­
Vonovia is based on the 
relevant statutory requirements, the Articles of Association 
and the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board."
"They form the basis for the company’s 
internal rules and guidelines, adherence to which is moni-
tored by a central compliance management system and 
administered by a guideline management team that forms 
part of the Legal department."
"The guidelines describe clear organizational and monitoring 
structures with specified responsibilities and appropriately 
installed checks."
"The legally compliant behavior of all 
employees in the business processes is ensured by suitable 
control procedures and supervision by managers."
"This individual also acts as the company’s human 
rights officer."
"An external ombudsperson is 
available to all employees and business partners as a confi-
dant with respect to compliance matters."
"The system also 
features an anonymous whistleblower hotline in six languag-
es."
"The hotline is available not only to employees, but also to 
external groups, such as customers and business partners."
"(3) Risk Management System
­
Vonovia’s strategy has a sustainable and long-term focus."
"As 
a result, ­
Vonovia pursues a conservative risk strategy in its 
business activities."
"This does not mean minimizing risks, but 
rather promoting entrepreneurial and responsible action and 
ensuring the necessary transparency with regard to any 
possible risks."
"The risk management system supports all employees in their 
day-to-day work in accordance with ­
Vonovia’s mission 
statement."
"The risk management system explicitly includes sustainabili-
ty risks."
"These are assessed both in terms of their impact on 
­
Vonovia (outside-in perspective) and also – in line with the 
concept of ESG due diligence – in terms of their impact on 
the environment and society (inside-out perspective)."
"This 
means that potential risks which might impair the value and/
or development of the company, or the environment and 
society, can be identified at an early stage."
"The risk manage-
ment system takes account of early warning indicators that 
are specific to the environment and the company, as well as 
the observations and regional knowledge of our employees."
"In organizational terms, risk management is assigned 
directly to the Management Board."
"It has overall responsibil-
ity and decides on the organizational structures and work-
flows of risk management and provision of resources."
"The 
operational management of the risk management system 
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
131
falls within the remit of the Head of Controlling, who is 
responsible for Risk Controlling."
"The Head of Controlling 
reports to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)."
"Risk Controlling 
initiates the software-supported, periodic risk management 
process and consolidates and validates the risks reported."
"It 
is also responsible for validating the risk management 
measures and monitoring their implementation."
"Risk Con-
trolling works with the individual risk owners to define early 
warning indicators that are used to monitor actual develop-
ments with regard to certain risks."
"The risk owners are the managers at the level directly below 
the Management Board."
"They are responsible for identifying, 
evaluating, managing, monitoring, documenting and com-
municating all risks in their sphere of responsibility."
"They are 
also responsible for recording and reporting all risks in the 
company’s risk tool based on the defined reporting cycles."
"Based on a half-yearly risk inventory taken in the first and 
third quarters of a fiscal year, Risk Controlling prepares a risk 
report for the Management Board and the Supervisory 
Board."
"It also simulates major risk developments and their 
impact on the corporate plans and objectives."
"The Manage-
ment Board approves the documented risk management 
findings, takes account of them in steering the company and 
reports them to the Supervisory Board."
"The Audit Commit-
tee of the Supervisory Board monitors the effectiveness of 
the risk management system."
"As part of the process involved in preparing the annual 
financial statements, the risks identified in the third quarter 
are reviewed by Risk Controlling to ensure they are up-to-
date and – if necessary – updated, with newly identified risks 
being added."
"New risks can arise in the context of the 
budget and five-year planning process."
"These are coordinat-
ed and evaluated bilaterally between Risk Controlling and 
the responsible risk owners as part of the planning process."
"­
Vonovia’s risk management system includes a simulation 
model to calculate the company’s risk-bearing capacity."
"As 
part of this analysis, risk management evaluates the interde-
pendencies between major risks on an annual or ad hoc 
basis and defines the parameters for risk aggregation."
"A 
Monte Carlo simulation model based on the statistical 
distribution functions relevant to the risks is used to deter-
mine the company’s overall risk position."
"The resulting 
overall risk position is compared to the company’s risk-­
bearing capacity with regard to insolvency and overindebt-
edness."
"Extreme scenarios for selected major risks are also 
simulated as part of the corporate planning process."
"The 
effects on the company’s performance indicators, as well as 
key figures related to financing, are always taken into 
account here."
"The results of the simulations are discussed 
with the Management Board."
"Planning and risk management 
are managed by the same area within Controlling."
"The risk management system is updated and refined on a 
regular basis and is also adjusted to reflect changes at the 
company."
"The effectiveness of the risk management system 
is analyzed in regular audits."
"The risk management system looks at all activities in the risk 
management process, i.e.,
 
> Risk identification,
 
> Risk assessment,
 
> Risk aggregation,
 
> Risk control and
 
> Risk monitoring."
"Based on the COSO Framework, a risk space with the 
following four main risk categories has been defined to 
facilitate risk identification: strategy, regulatory environment 
and overall statutory framework, operating business and 
financing (including accounting and tax)."
"A structured risk 
catalog has been assigned to each of these categories."
"When it comes to assessing risk, a distinction is made 
between risks with an impact on profit and loss and those 
affecting the balance sheet."
"Risks with an impact on profit 
and loss have a negative effect on the company’s sustained 
earnings power and, as a result, on Adjusted EBITDA in the 
individual segments and Group FFO (Adjusted EBT in the 
future)."
"In general, these risks also have an impact on 
liquidity."
"Risks affecting the balance sheet do not impact 
Group FFO, but they certainly do impact the assets and, in 
general, also profit for the period and the EPRA NTA."
"These 
risks can also not affect liquidity, e.g., because they only 
impact property values."

If possible, risk assessments are always to be performed in 
quantitative terms."
"As a general rule, the risk assessment 
should always be based on a worst-case scenario."
"If this is 
difficult or impossible to achieve, a qualitative assessment is 
to be performed using a detailed matrix."
"Five clusters have been defined for the expected probability 
of occurrence."

The expected amount of loss and the probability of occur-
rence are classified within the set ranges before action 
(gross) and after action (net) for each risk, documented in a 
risk tool and transferred to a heatmap there."
"Risk reporting is 
based on the net assessment and the assignment of risks in 
the net heatmap, comprising five categories for both proba-
bility of occurrence and the amount of loss."
"Net Heatmap
The term “top risks” refers to the risks assigned to the red 
and amber fields."
"These are reported to the Supervisory 
Board and published as part of the external reporting pro-
cess."
"The risks assigned to the red fields are classified as 
threatening or endangering the company or its survival."
"The 
risks assigned to the amber fields are significant to the 
company."
"Red and amber risks are subject to intensive moni-
toring by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board."

As part of an active risk control process, the focus is on the 
major (red and amber) risks."
"Any necessary specific risk 
management measures were agreed and incorporated into a 
regular monitoring process to be conducted by Risk Con-
trolling."
"Regular risk monitoring by Risk Controlling ensures that risk 
management measures are implemented as planned."
"All key processes at ­
Vonovia are recorded and documented 
centrally with the help of a process management software 
solution."
"In addition to the relevant process steps, this 
documentation highlights key risks and controls in the 
interests of a process-oriented internal control system (ICS)."
"It provides the binding basis for subsequent evaluations, 
audits and reporting to the executive bodies of ­
Vonovia SE 
on the effectiveness of the ICS within the meaning of Section 
107 (3) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG)."
"Overall responsibility for structuring and implementing the 
ICS lies with ­
Vonovia’s Management Board."
"The Manage-
ment Board delegates this responsibility to process and 
control owners."
"The Internal Audit department provides 
support in the further technical development of the ICS in 
addition to performing its primary audit duties in full."
"Internal Audit is responsible for providing technical support 
for the documentation software, with administrative support 
being provided by IT."
"The aim of the accounting-related internal control and risk 
management system is to ensure due and proper and legally 
compliant financial reporting pursuant to the relevant 
regulations."
"The accounting-related internal control and risk 
management system is embedded in the overarching 
Group-wide risk management system."
"Organizationally, responsibility for preparing the financial 
statements lies with the department of the Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO) and, in particular, with the Accounting depart-
ment."
"The Accounting department exercises the authority to 
lay down guidelines for the application of relevant account-
ing standards as well as for the content and timing of the 
steps in the financial statements preparation process."
"Furthermore, through the shared service center 
functions it is ensured that both content and organizational 
changes in the requirements are incorporated in the financial 
statement preparation process."
"The financial statements of the companies included in the 
consolidated financial statements – with the exception of 
individual service companies, the operating nursing care 
companies the companies in Sweden and the investment in 
the Netherlands – are located in an IT SAP environment."
"They are subject largely to uniform charts of account, 
accounting guidelines, processes and process controls."
"The 
requirement of separation of functions and the dual-review 
principle are taken appropriate account of with preventive 
and also subsequent checks."
"The corresponding service companies of the ­
Deutsche 
­
Wohnen Group as well as those in Sweden and the invest-
ment in the Netherlands, as well as the operating nursing 
care companies, report their data as part of a structured 
IT-based data recording process."
"The relevant financial statement data of the individual 
companies are made available to the SAP consolidation 
module via an integrated, automated interface with compre-
hensive validation rules for further processing and prepara-
tion of the consolidated financial statements."
"An authoriza-
tion concept is in place granting access to the financial 
statements in line with the respective job profile of the 
employee."
"Newly acquired companies are incorporated into the internal 
control environment as part of a structured integration 
process, which includes integration in terms of both IT 
systems and processes relating to financial statements."
"Once the financial statements have been drawn up, the 
annual and consolidated financial statements, including the 
consolidated management report, are submitted to the 
Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of the Supervisory 
Board."
"The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee then 
makes a recommendation for the Supervisory Board to 
adopt or approve them."
"This examination may include 
discussion with the auditor and is subject to the auditor’s 
report."
"The Audit, Risk and Compliance is continually 
involved in the establishment and refinement of the 
­
accounting-related internal control and risk management 
system."

(5) Internal Audit
The system and control environment, business processes 
and the internal control system (ICS) are audited on a 
regular basis by ­
Vonovia’s Group Audit department."
"In 
organizational terms, Group Audit reports to the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO)."
"The annual audit plan is based on a 
risk-oriented evaluation of all relevant audit areas of the 
Group (audit universe) and is approved by the Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board’s Audit, Risk and Compli-
ance Committee."
"The audits conducted throughout the year focus on assess-
ing the effectiveness of the control and risk management 
systems, identifying process improvements in order to 
minimize risks and ensuring the sustainability of ­
Vonovia’s 
business activities."
"Corresponding special ad hoc audits are 
also performed in consultation with the Management Board."
"The internal reports are presented to the Management 
Board, the individuals responsible for the area reviewed and, 
in cases involving significant and serious findings, the risk 
manager and, where relevant, the compliance officer on a 
regular basis."
"The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee 
receives a quarterly summary of the audit results and 
measures."
"The implementation status of the agreed mea-
sures is monitored on an ongoing basis after the relevant 
due dates and is reported to the Management Board and the 
Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee on a quarterly basis."
"A follow-up audit is conducted to ensure that any serious 
findings have been remedied."
"Current Risk Assessment 
A scheduled risk inventory was performed in both the first 
and second half of the 2023 fiscal year."
"The risk report was 
presented to the Management Board and the Audit Commit-
tee."
"The risk inventory for the second half of the year was 
adjusted/updated at the end of 2023."
"There were no un-
scheduled ad hoc risk reports in the 2023 fiscal year or up 
until the time at which the balance sheet was prepared."
"Overall Assessment of the Risk Situation
A total of 118 (2022: 107) individual risks were identified for 
­
Vonovia at the end of 2023."
"All in all, and based on the current assessment, there were 
no signs of any risks threatening or endangering ­
Vonovia or 
its survival at the end of 2023."
"The outcome of the risk-bearing capacity analysis performed 
in 2023 revealed that there is no current threat to ­
Vonovia’s 
survival over the five-year period."
"This means that there is 
no change as against the risk assessment performed at the 
end of 2022 overall."
"The risks to be modeled were quantified and the interaction 
between individual top risks and selected green risks ana-
lyzed in detail at the end of 2023."
"10 (2022: 11) amber risks to the company and 108 (2022: 96) 
other green risks were identified."
"Specifically, the picture 
that emerges for each risk category is as follows (prior-year 
figures in brackets):
Risks Related to Operating Business
In the operating business, we identified the three amber 
risks (2022: four) explained below at the end of 2023."
"The residential properties held in the Rental segment are 
subject to a regular valuation process."
"Details can be found 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in 
chapter 
 [D28] Investment Properties."
"Lower property values would push up the 
company’s loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which could have a 
negative impact on its ability to raise capital."
"In order to 
limit risk, ­
Vonovia is committed to maintaining the current 
diversification of its portfolio."
"The development in the supply of, and demand for, residen-
tial properties has a significant influence on the home prices 
that can be achieved and, as a result, a direct impact on both 
Adjusted EBITDA in the Recurring Sales segment and the 
success of Non Core sales."
"A decline in real estate prices 
was recorded in the 2023 fiscal year."
"A scenario in which 
interest rates were to remain permanently high and/or 
increase further could lead to buyers no longer being able to 
finance the home prices asked for on the market."
"This could 
reduce demand and result in lower home prices, which could 
represent a risk with an impact on profit and loss for the 
Recurring Sales segment."
"In order to limit and 
monitor risk, regular reporting on sales volumes and prices 
and regular monitoring of target prices and sales volume 
targets by the portfolio controlling team has been imple-
mented alongside a process for identifying ideal prices."
"We 
have adjusted our plans for investments in new builds 
accordingly."
"In order to be able to respond to market 
changes early on, in-depth market studies and analyses are 
prepared at regular intervals and are analyzed in connection 
with reports prepared by renowned real estate experts."
"Any 
market changes that are identified are taken into account 
when analyzing the real estate portfolio, meaning that they 
have a significant impact on sales planning."
"Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine once again had an 
impact on the energy and construction materials markets 
in 2023."
"Rising energy costs also translated into higher costs 
for construction materials and led to bottlenecks in the 
procurement of construction materials in a large number of 
places."
"This has resulted in deteriorating overall conditions 
for construction and modernization projects in our Develop-
ment and Value-add segments, with negative knock-on 
effects on Adjusted EBITDA in the segments."
"We have 
adjusted our investment strategy accordingly and expect the 
increase in costs to slow as of 2024."
"The expected 
amount of loss was evaluated at € 40–150 million (2022: 
€ 40–150 million)."
"In order to limit this risk, ­
Vonovia monitors 
the market systematically while simultaneously developing 
alternatives, e.g., revising specifications and using standard-
ization to reduce material usage."
"In addition, critical materi-
als are secured early on and, where appropriate, stored 
where possible."
"Risks Related to Regulatory Environment & Overall Statu-
tory Framework
Changes in the regulatory environment and in the overall 
statutory framework could give rise to risks for all of 
­
Vonovia’s business segments."
"At present, 2 (2022: 2) key 
amber risks have been identified."
"In Germany, the regulations governing the handling and 
identification of toxic materials are to be tightened up 
through a specific amendment to the German Hazardous 
Substances Ordinance (Gefahrstoffverordnung)."
"Any 
amendment will have an impact on all of ­
Vonovia’s technical 
processes (including small-scale repairs, vacant apartment 
refurbishment, major maintenance measures, moderniza-
tion)."
"Regarding the process involved in the refurbishment of 
vacant apartments, an initial rough quantification has been 
carried out, although this process has still to be completed 
for all of the other technical processes."
"The risk associated 
with an “Amendment to the Hazardous Substances Ordi-
nance” was therefore subjected to a qualitative assessment 
as an initial step, and was found to be associated with a 
significant loss amount and a probability of occurrence of 
60–95%."
"A project involving all of the specialist departments 
involved has been launched to ensure the definitive quanti-
tative assessment of this risk in relation to all of ­
Vonovia’s 
technical processes in 2024."
"A final assessment of the risk 
Opportunities and Risks
Combined Management Report —

will depend on the specific content of the proposed legisla-
tion."
"Changes to, or the application of, legal provisions that are 
beyond ­
Vonovia’s control, and inadequate documentation of 
management decisions can lead to legal disputes and give 
rise to the risk of material implications."
"The total number of 
legal disputes ongoing at ­
Vonovia is small."
"In addition to 
cases related to the core Rental business, such as an-
nounced modernization projects or the appropriateness of 
ancillary expense bills, these include other operating, labor 
law and corporate law disputes, some of which are material, 
particularly in connection with transactions."
"The 
increased amount of loss in 2023 as against the prior-year 
assessment is due to the additional inclusion of a legal 
dispute with a social insurance provider."
"In a quest to limit 
this risk, internal and external experts are analyzing the 
individual scenarios and the current situation on an ongoing 
basis, and the Legal department is involved in all key man-
agement decisions."
"The two amber regulatory risks identified in 2022, namely 
”unfavorable carbon tax” and “unfavorable exchange rate 
developments” were downgraded to green in 2023."
"The risk associated with an ”unfavorable carbon tax” has 
changed to a ”substantial increase in the CO2 price”."
"As the 
expected increase in the CO2 price is now largely reflected in 
the company’s updated plans, the assessment of the proba-
bility of occurrence was reduced from 60–95% to 40–59%, 
and the assessment of the potential amount of loss was 
reduced from € 40–150 million to € 5–40 million."
"The risk  “unfavorable exchange rate developments” was 
downgraded from amber to green given what is already a 
weak Swedish krona."
"With an unchanged potential amount 
of loss of € 40–150 million, the expected probability of 
occurrence of a further negative trend was reduced from 
40–59% to 5-39%."
"Risks Related to Financing
With regard to financing, we identified the five amber risks 
(2022: five) explained below at the end of 2023."
"Restricted access to the bond market and a poorer rating 
could give rise to refinancing risks for ­
Vonovia, meaning that 
too little liquidity might be available temporarily."
"­
Vonovia implemented extensive refinancing measures 
successfully in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Ratings also met the 
company’s expectations."
"Details can be found in the chapter
 The Company and Its Shares in the management report."
"The higher 
probability of occurrence reflects developments on the real 
estate market, which has come under pressure due to supply 
problems, inflation and the associated higher refinancing 
interest rates."
"In 2022, the risk “restricted access to the 
bond market” was still assessed with a potential amount of 
loss of >€ 750 million and an expected probability of occur-
rence of <5%."
"In 2022, the risk “loss of the BBB+ (S&P) or A3 
(Moody’s) rating” was assessed with a potential amount of 
loss of € 25-100 million and an expected probability of 
occurrence of <5%."
"The active and timely management of refinancing maturities 
allows ­
Vonovia to ensure a balanced maturity profile so as to 
avoid cluster risks."
"­
Vonovia continues to use all financing 
instruments that are used as standard on the market and 
has the internal expertise to place these instruments."
"This 
prevents any one-sided reliance on specific types of financ-
ing."
"Being awarded an investment-grade rating is the very 
top priority in all strategic decisions."
"As a result, we remain 
in close dialog with our rating agencies."
"In the very unlikely 
event that refinancing via the capital market is temporarily 
impossible, ­
Vonovia can resort to existing available credit 
lines."
"A further increase in capital market interest rates could give 
rise to risks for ­
Vonovia’s growth and result in planned 
investments being cut back, suspended or canceled com-
pletely."
"In addition, an increasing interest burden due to 
unfavorable interest rate developments could translate into 
lower growth or even a drop in Group FFO."
"The expected probability 
of occurrence remained unchanged at 5–39%."
"As well as 
diversifying debt capital instruments and maintaining a 
balanced maturity profile, risks are limited by ensuring a 
long-term average maturity/fixed-interest period of around 
six years."
"Debt reduction by freeing up liquidity is another 
measure used to limit risk."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
137
­
Vonovia is obliged to report certain key figures and adhere to 
certain covenants in connection with bonds, secured loans 
and transactions."
"If these covenants are not adhered to or 
these reporting obligations are not fulfilled on time, ­
Vonovia 
could be subject to payment obligations and additional 
negative effects on earnings could result from new financing 
arrangements."
"In 
order to counter this risk, ­
Vonovia has implemented stan-
dardized processes for monitoring and managing its obliga-
tions."
"The amendments to the German Real Estate Transfer Tax 
Act that came into force on July 1, 2021, lowering the partici-
pation threshold from 95% to 90% and increasing the 
observation period from five to ten years, could give rise to a 
subsequent liability to pay real estate transfer tax."
"In addition to 
monitoring court decisions and legislation on an ongoing 
basis, ­
Vonovia also limits this risk by raising awareness 
among decision-makers in the context of share deals."
"This 
ensures the involvement of the internal Tax department, 
which then helps monitor the acquisition process."
"Goodwill arose in the context of acquisitions in the past 
because the purchase price exceeded the value of the assets 
acquired less all liabilities."
"Goodwill is subjected to regular 
impairment testing, at least once a year."
"This involves 
comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying 
amount of the group of cash-generating units (CGUs)."
"The 
recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is either its value 
in use or fair value less costs of sale, whichever is higher."
"If 
the carrying amount of a CGU is higher than the recoverable 
amount, impairment losses need to be recognized."
"This can 
have an impact on our covenants."
"At present, we consider 
this amber risk affecting the balance sheet to have an 
expected amount of loss of € 600–2,400 million (2022: 
€ 600–2,400 million) and a probability of occurrence of 
40–59% (2022: 40–59%)."
"In order to counter this risk, an 
ongoing performance reporting system has been implement-
ed to identify and monitor deviations from our plans."
"This 
allows us to take any corrective action required to be able to 
stick to our plans."
"Within this context, a dedicated synergy 
monitoring process also ensures that planned synergies 
from acquisition projects are actually leveraged."
"The resulting climate transition 
risks describe the effects that can arise for companies due to 
the process of transformation towards a sustainable eco-
nomic system."
"­
Vonovia has set itself an intensity target 
equating to a roughly 35% reduction in GHG emissions in its 
German portfolio by 2030 compared to 2021, in order to 
achieve its climate objectives and meet the associated 
regulatory requirements."
"We are sticking to this climate 
target despite limited investments in modernization and new 
construction over the coming year."
"As a result, we continue 
to consider the ”risk of non-compliance with our climate 
path” to be associated with a low (2022: low) amount of loss 
and consider its materialization to be improbable (2022: 
improbable)."
"What is more, crisis situations or catastrophes, such as 
floods, earthquakes, extreme weather events etc., could 
have an impact on our real estate portfolio and require 
Opportunities and Risks
Combined Management Report —
138
specific crisis management measures."
"These physical 
climate risks can be traced back to longer-term shifts in 
overall climatic conditions."
"We have assessed the corre-
sponding ”risk of business continuity in disasters/crisis 
situations” as being associated with an amount of loss of 
€ 5–40 million (2022: € 5–40 million) and a probability of 
occurrence of 5–39% (2022: 5–39%)."
"Transition risks and physical climate risks could potentially 
have a negative impact on the Group’s net assets, financial 
position and results of operations and could make the 
estimates used in an accounting context less certain."
"We do 
not believe that climate change gives rise to any significant 
direct risks (2022: also no significant direct risks) for the 
period covered by the risk management system at the 
moment, e.g., caused by extreme weather conditions such 
as heavy rain with the potential for floods."
"Based on our 
current knowledge of future developments, this will not have 
any impact on ­
Vonovia’s balance sheet."
"This relates, among 
other things, to the fair values of investment properties, 
useful lives and the value of assets and provisions for 
environmental risks, for which no significant need for 
adjustment emerges (see
 Environmental Issues)."
"When it comes to the development of new and sustainable 
fields of business in the Value-add segment – particularly 
with regard to renewable energies – risks can arise from the 
design and implementation of the business models."
"Pro-
curement prices can also develop differently than expected."
"At present, we have assigned this ”procurement price risk in 
our energy services area” an amount of loss of € 40–150 mil-
lion (2022: € 40–150 million) and a probability of occurrence 
of <5% (2022: <5%)."
"With regard to the planned ”expansion 
of renewable energies using photovoltaic systems,” we have 
assessed the related risks as having a low (2022: low) 
amount of loss and a probability of occurrence of 5–39% 
(2022: 5–39%)."
"Social Risks
As a result of its insourcing strategy, qualified specialists are 
in high demand at ­
Vonovia, particularly in comparison with 
its peers in the sector."
"Inability to fill vacant positions could 
lead to a lack of growth, restricted quality and lower levels of 
customer satisfaction, as well as rising costs due to the need 
to use subcontractors."
"Thanks to effective strategies for 
recruitment and staff retention, we assess the risk associat-
ed with a ”shortage of skilled workers” as having a potential 
amount of loss of € 5–40 million (2022: low) and believe that 
this risk is unlikely (2022: unlikely) to materialize."
"Failure to comply with statutory occupational health and 
safety and occupational safety management provisions 
could have a long-term impact for ­
Vonovia and its employ-
ees."
"We currently assess these risks as being associated 
with a considerable (2022: considerable) amount of loss but 
believe that they are very unlikely (2022: very unlikely) to 
materialize."
"The annual financial burden for tenants (in the form of 
ancillary expenses) could increase significantly due to 
external factors, such as price increases and changes in 
overall conditions."
"Reliable market forecasts are virtually 
impossible due to the ongoing war in Ukraine."
"In light of the 
measures already taken, we now believe that the risk associ-
ated with “rising energy costs” is unlikely (2022: very likely) 
to materialize, and have predicted a low (2022: low) amount 
of loss."
"Governance Risks
On March 7, 2023, investigators seized documents from 
­
Vonovia premises; they were acting on the suspicion of 
problematic procedures in the awarding of contracts to 
subcontractors, to the detriment of ­
Vonovia."
"Although the 
final results of the investigations are not yet available, 
­
Vonovia assumes that its compliance management system 
is functioning and effective."
"As a result, there is no change in 
the assessment of the risk associated with “bribery and 
corruption” in a year-on-year comparison."
"The probability of 
occurrence (very unlikely) and the amount of loss (low) 
remain unchanged."
"­
Vonovia is exposed to the  “risk of losing the basis for 
sustainable financing”."
"Sustainable “green” financing is 
becoming increasingly relevant."
"Failure by ­
Vonovia to meet 
its sustainability targets, for example, could jeopardize the 
basis for this financing."
"At present, we have assigned this 
risk an amount of loss of € 150-375 million (2022: € 375–
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
139
750 million) and a probability of occurrence of <5% (2022: 
<5%)."
"In addition, ­
Vonovia could be exposed to risks associated 
with non-compliance with statutory requirements and 
investor or analyst expectations regarding ongoing sustain-
ability reporting."
"We currently assess this risk as being 
associated with a noticeable (2022: noticeable) amount of 
loss, but believe that it is very unlikely (2022: very unlikely) 
to materialize."

"The 
assumptions applied within this context regarding the 
economic environment and market-related factors, and the 
company’s operating business, are associated with potential 
for deviations."
"These deviations do not necessarily have to 
be negative (risks)."
"Favorable business developments 
(opportunities) that deviate from the company’s plans are 
also a possibility."
"Besides the economic opportunities, 
opportunities also arise from primary sustainability objec-
tives that extend beyond the initiatives included in the 
company’s plans."
"Our business model is de-
signed to take into account the megatrends that are relevant 
to us (urbanization/shortage of housing, demographic 
change, climate protection) and the exploitation of econo-
mies of scale."
"By managing larger contiguous stocks, we can 
not only manage the homes we offer in a particularly 
cost-effective manner, but can also make an effective 
contribution to social tasks – first and foremost by reducing 
the shortage of homes in conurbations and achieving the 
climate transition."
"If social pressure to find solutions to 
social challenges continues to mount, the overall conditions 
for implementing our business model could also improve 
further."
"According to the Federal Climate Change Act (Klima-
schutzgesetz), Germany is aiming to be greenhouse 
gas-neutral by 2045."
"We can, and indeed want, to make a 
significant contribution to improving greenhouse gas emis-
sions by building new homes in line with the latest energy 
and material standards, and by energy-efficient moderniza-
tion."
"We made a commitment to a climate path that will 
enable us to achieve virtually greenhouse gas-neutral 
management of our portfolio by 2045."
"Homes with positive 
energy concepts not only protect the climate, but also 
reduce heating costs."
"This makes them more attractive to 
our customers."
"What is more, the improved structural 
specifications increase property values."
"If we make faster 
progress than planned on our climate path, this could have a 
knock-on positive impact on earnings and value develop-
ment."
"Low-emission refurbishment and new construction mea-
sures entail substantial investment."
"In this respect, we 
benefit from the fact that optimizing the energy efficiency of 
our portfolio has been at the core of our climate strategy 
since as long ago as 2017."
"Since then, our modernization/
refurbishment rate has consistently outstripped the German 
average."
"In order to keep costs at a minimum, we make use 
of innovations (e.g., Energiesprong) and focus on tried-and-
tested urban quarter approaches in the implementation 
process."
"We reduce construction times and conserve 
resources through efficient construction methods and the 
use of sustainable, ecological building materials."
"Should the 
overall economic conditions (interest rates, subsidy condi-
tions, construction prices) improve, we could make even 
greater use of the opportunities open to us in the area of 
low-emission refurbishment and new construction, with a 
positive impact on rental income."
"As we transition towards climate-neutral neighborhoods 
offering real quality of life, we expect opportunities to arise 
for us from the targeted digital networking of electricity, heat 
and mobility."
"Our company is in an excellent position, with 
its contiguous portfolios, to successfully implement what is 
known as sector coupling."
"We are cooperating with relevant 
research institutions and implementing successful pilot 
projects within this context."
"The concept of a networked 
supply to the neighborhood could be implemented on a 
larger scale more quickly than expected."
"This would then 
have positive implications for long-term earnings develop-
ment."
"Relevant opportunities are also arising for us from the 
expansion of renewable energies; this refers to the direct 
sale of green electricity to our tenants, as well as the pro-
duction (and sale) of electricity from renewable sources at 
our properties."
"With this in mind, we are forging ahead with 
the expansion of photovoltaics programs and the sale of 
electricity to tenants (tenant electricity), among other 
things."
"Photovoltaics systems can be connected to the heat 
supply (heat pumps)."
"The implementation of concepts for 
energy self-generation could be realized faster than planned 
with a corresponding positive impact on the earnings

situation."
"The Power Purchase Agreement concluded 
between ­
Vonovia and RWE Supply & Trading enables 
alternative ways of generating and purchasing energy and 
opens up further growth potential."
"The Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPA) has initially been concluded for a term of 
one year."
"The electricity will come from the Wust-Fischbeck 
onshore wind farm near Stendal."
"This makes ­
Vonovia one of 
the first residential real estate companies to conclude a PPA 
for green electricity."
"Green electricity has been supplied 
since January 2024."
"The electricity is generated by ten wind 
turbines."
"Research data on projected demographic trends suggest 
that population growth will continue both in Germany and in 
parts of Europe over the coming years."
"Immigration is a key 
growth driver."
"This means that demand for affordable 
housing will remain high or even continue to grow."
"As things 
stand at present, the fundamental need for housing is 
unlikely to be met in full by general new construction mea-
sures, either in the short or medium term."
"This translates 
directly into opportunities for us for the rental, development 
and new construction business."
"Demographic change towards an aging society continues, 
and is increasingly leaving its mark."
"Demand for senior-­
friendly and affordable homes is expected to increase 
further over the coming years."
"As a result, opportunities 
could arise from senior-friendly modernization of our 
apartments and investment in new and innovative housing 
concepts."
"This is expected to come hand-in-hand with 
further rental growth."
"In a quest to master the current social challenges, policy-
makers are also seeking to improve overall conditions on the 
housing market."
"The coalition agreement concluded by the 
current German government promised initiatives to both 
significantly increase the supply of affordable homes 
through new construction and transform existing properties 
in a manner that is as climate-neutral as possible."
"Imple-
mentation of these projects is currently stalling – with a 
marked adverse effect on the housing markets (drop in new 
construction, growing shortage of housing)."
"As soon as 
short-term solutions can be found to address this problem in 
terms of improved subsidy conditions and price develop-
ments, corresponding opportunities will also emerge for us."
"The capital required to solve the challenges facing the 
housing industry cannot be raised without private sector 
involvement."
"As a result, policymakers are increasingly being 
called upon to create an investment climate that encourages 
long-term equity and debt capital providers to make sub-
stantial investments in the residential real estate markets."
"A 
positive investment climate also means making the neces-
sary ecological construction and modernization measures 
commercially viable, making additional land available for 
construction, cutting back on red tape and generally promot-
ing acceptance of private-sector real estate investors."
"The 
increasing acceptance of long-term investors for projects in 
the German residential construction sector is likely to open 
up further development opportunities for ­
Vonovia."
"With our management platform, we pursue an efficient 
business model that is scalable at all times."
"This also makes 
it suitable for managing new portfolios that we add to our 
portfolio through acquisitions."
"­
Vonovia pursues acquisitions 
as and when opportunities present themselves in light of the 
current opportunities for returns and financing."
"If overall 
conditions improve, there is an opportunity for us to have a 
positive impact on our business development by resuming 
acquisitions."
"Levels of satisfaction among our customers are closely 
linked to the performance and motivation of our employees 
working in customer service."
"Our corporate strategy also 
focuses on our employees’ further development and on 
employee satisfaction."
"We aim to make use of new HR 
development concepts and actively shape the recruitment of 
new staff to fill vacant positions."
"We are aiming to increase 
the proportion of women at the first and second levels of 
management."
"All in all, further opportunities could arise for 
­
Vonovia due to the advantages associated with diversity and 
as a result of our increased appeal as an employer, namely 
higher levels of production and lower staff turnover rates."
"Economic Environment and Market-related ­
Opportunities
The housing industry is being influenced to a considerable 
degree by social trends."
"One key trend involves the influx of 
people from rural regions to urban areas."
"The infrastructure 
in urban areas is well developed, with extensive healthcare 
services available."
"People do not have to travel far to work 
and can enjoy varied leisure activities."
"According to analyses 
released by the German Federal Statistical Office, domestic 
migration to the country’s large metropolitan areas will 
continue unchanged over the next few years."
"The current 
slowdown in construction activity is likely to result in an 
even greater imbalance between the supply of and demand 
for housing in conurbations."
"350,000 to 400,000 new 
residential units will have to be built every year over the next 
twenty years."
"The shortage of housing in urban areas could 
be exacerbated further by the effects of migration from glob-
al crisis hotspots and the trend toward smaller households."
"In response to the shortage of (skilled) workers, the German 
government has set itself the goal of promoting immigration 
from non-EU countries specifically."
"The German Federal 
Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit) expects 
Germany to require around 400,000 immigrants a year to 
close the gaps on the labor market resulting from demo-
graphic changes."
"According to the Cologne Institute for 
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
141
Economic Research, this would translate into a potential 
shortfall of as much as 308,000 apartments a year in the 
medium term."
"Our company can reap considerable benefits from these 
trends: With our existing real estate portfolio, we focus 
primarily on small and medium-sized apartments in urban 
areas."
"This means that we offer the right homes in the right 
places."
"­
Vonovia is also in a position to counter the increasing 
shortage of affordable housing through our development 
and new construction business (to sell and to hold)."
"This is 
subject to the proviso that the overall economic and political 
conditions and the investment environment improve."
"This 
will not be possible without deregulation measures and the 
provision of additional land for construction, which could, in 
turn, create opportunities for ­
Vonovia."
"Opportunities Arising from the Operating Business
­
Vonovia manages its housing portfolios throughout Germa-
ny using standardized systems and processes."
"Our manage-
ment platform has been improved as part of a step-by-step 
process in recent years and is now highly efficient: The 
vacancy rate is very low."
"Property management costs per 
residential unit have been reduced considerably over the 
years."
"Customer satisfaction has risen significantly over the 
same period."
"Together with the range of housing-related 
services and active neighborhood management, we offer our 
customers a service package that is extremely competitive 
on the housing market."
"We have our own craftsman’s organization (VTS), which 
provides repair, maintenance and servicing for some of our 
residential properties."
"We purchase additional craftsman’s 
services."
"We are aiming to continually increase the propor-
tion of building and apartment optimizing services we 
provide ourselves via our craftsmen’s organization as well as 
new building construction over the coming years."
"Due to the 
shortage of workers with the desired skills and the availabili-
ty of corresponding capacities, we also intend to extend the 
scope of these services to cover all kinds of technical work 
and thus bring added value from these services to ­
Vonovia."
"This is being supported by corresponding HR management 
concepts."
"This also includes the operationalization and rapid imple-
mentation of our PV and tenant electricity capacities, for 
which we are establishing the corresponding staff resources 
to ensure that the required expertise is available."
"The 
company’s own tenant electricity and heat pump tariffs and 
the considerable roof areas available could open up opera-
tional earnings opportunities for the company and make a 
relevant contribution to the energy and climate transition."
"The Value-add Business offers our customers services that 
are closely related to the rental business."
"Opportunities 
associated with additional earnings potential could also 
arise here at all stages in the value chain – be it through the 
company’s development of its own innovative services or 
through the acquisition of start-ups or other companies."
"In 
the Value-add Business, promising opportunities could arise 
both from entry into the B2B business and from moves to 
expand existing business models to include customer groups 
outside of ­
Vonovia."
"Digitalization opens up considerable development opportu-
nities for the real estate industry and, as a result, also for 
­
Vonovia – in terms of both technology and process optimiza-
tion."
"We are still making systematic investments in testing 
and expanding new technologies."
"Two of the areas we are 
focusing on are articifical intelligence and robotics."
"One key component for the implementation of our digital 
strategy is the digital twin."
"In the future, it will mirror each of 
our buildings with all its various systems, enabling optimum 
management."
"Predictive maintenance, for example, could allow potential 
damage to elevators or heating units to be recognized and 
prevented in a timely manner in the future."
"Smart home 
systems allow tenants to consciously manage their energy 
costs."
"Digital communication platforms have the potential to 
improve dialog with tenants, but also to support loyalty to 
the company and links within the neighborhood."
"These 
opportunities for the company’s operating business resulting 
from digitalization should also have an impact on and 
through customer satisfaction."
"One factor that ­
Vonovia cannot control itself, but which is 
important for successful and, most importantly, efficient 
project implementation, is the digitalization of public admin-

istration."
"The streamlining of administrative processes could 
accelerate, and have a positive impact on, ­
Vonovia’s devel-
opment and new construction business by allowing building 
permits to be approved faster."
"Financial Opportunities
­
Vonovia has benefited from good conditions on the capital 
and banking market in recent years to establish a very stable 
capital structure."
"We now have a broad range of financing 
instruments that are balanced and stable in the long term."
This is reflected in a consistently high credit rating.
"The 
latest bond issues show that our company still has good 
opportunities available to it, even in a difficult capital market 
environment, to successfully realize upcoming (re)financing 
measures or to raise necessary liquidity."
"During this phase, 
we are responding to the continued high level of trust placed 
in us by investors by paying particular attention to cost 
discipline and a forward-looking capital structure policy."
"Together with the diversification strategy for liquidity 
procurement that we have been pursuing for many years 
now, we still have the opportunity in the current capital 
market environment to optimize the structure and condi-
tions of our financial liabilities."
"Rising inflation and interest rates recently forced us to 
reassess the profitability of our investments."
"Ongoing 
pursuit of our sustainability targets remained non-negotiable 
during this process."
"As a result, we are currently focusing 
more on financing using our own funds (internal financing)."
"In order to generate the necessary funds, we are continuing 
with the program involving the sale of selected portfolios, as 
announced."
"We are also tapping into new sources of financ-
ing."
"These include private equity joint ventures in which 
long-term investors acquire minority stakes in selected 
portfolios, with ­
Vonovia retaining a buy-back option for 
these properties."
"More intensive sales efforts for our devel-
opment projects will also have a positive effect on our 
internal financing power."
"All in all, stronger internal financing 
potential could allow for investment decisions, where 
appropriate opportunities arise, to boost the company’s 
overall profitability or to allow it to pursue more sustainabili-
ty initiatives and earnings potential."
"By strengthening the proportion of equity and focusing on 
internal financing, we have achieved optimum capital 
allocation."
"This is a significant value driver that opens up 
opportunities for return-oriented sustainable investment."
"Our investments in affordable homes are associated with a 
cash flow that is largely independent of economic factors."
"The resulting stability allows us to service our financial 
liabilities with a relative degree of certainty, even in times of 
economic or political crisis."
"This is evident, in particular, 
from the fact that our rent default rate, which was already 
low to begin with, has not increased to any significant 
degree, even in the year dominated by Russia’s war of 
aggression against Ukraine and supply chain disruption that 
was 2022."

Forecast Report 
Business Outlook for 2024
The forecast was based on the accounting principles used in 
the consolidated financial statements, with the adjustments 
described elsewhere in the management report being made."
"The forecast does not take account of any larger acquisitions 
of real estate portfolios."
"Our forecast for the 2024 fiscal year is based on determined 
and updated corporate planning for the ­
Vonovia Group as a 
whole and considers current business developments as well 
as possible opportunities and risks."
"It also includes the key 
overall macroeconomic developments and the economic 
factors that are relevant to the real estate industry and our 
corporate strategy."
"Further information is provided in the 
sections entitled
 Development of the Economy and the Industry 
and
 Fundamental Information About the Group."
"Beyond this, the 
Group’s further development remains exposed to general 
opportunities and risks (see 
 Opportunities and Risks)."
"We expect the price increases on the construction and 
commodity markets, in particular, continue to have a moder-
ate impact on ­
Vonovia and our customers."
"While these will 
have a direct impact on ancillary expenses, they will also 
have an indirect effect on all areas of the economy due to 
general price increases."
"We also expect prices for construc-
tion materials to remain high, which will affect our construc-
tion projects as well."
"Unchanged high interest rates and 
inflation continue to create increased volatility on the equity 
and debt capital markets."
"We therefore assess the overall 
economic situation and developments on an ongoing basis, 
particularly with regard to the return requirements for 
investment and divestment decisions."
"The EBITDA contribution for our core Rental business is 
expected to more or less match the previous year’s level."
"In a 
year-on-year comparison, organic rent increases and associ-
ated higher rental income will be offset by higher rent losses 
stemming from sales resulting in a smaller portfolio."
"As far 
as the Value-add segment is concerned, we expect to see a 
pronounced increase in Adjusted EBITDA in 2024, mainly as 
a result of us ramping our investment activity back up."
"We 
also predict a marked increase in the EBITDA contribution 
for our Development segment thanks to higher demand for 
new condominiums."
"Depending on how the demand for 
existing apartments develops going forward, we expect 
Adjusted EBITDA in the Recurring Sales segment to be up 
slightly year-on-year."
"The Care segment was reported as a 
discontinued operation at the end of the 2023 fiscal year and 
is therefore no longer included in the 2024 forecast."
"At 
Group level, we therefore expect to see an Adjusted EBITDA 
Total that is roughly on a par with the previous year overall."
"The rise in interest rates over the last two years is resulting 
in a marked increase in borrowing costs and the associated 
adjusted net financial result."
"Based on stable depreciation 
and amortization, we therefore expect Adjusted EBT to be 
slightly below the previous year’s level."
"Due in particular to heavier investment in our existing 
portfolio, we expect our investment activity to increase 
in 2024."
"In addition, we expect the value of our company to 
increase further and, as a result, predict a slight increase in 
EPRA NTA per share, leaving any further market-related 
changes in property value out of the equation."
"The values for the individual weighted targets for the 2024 
fiscal year produce a standardized forecast of 100% for the 
Sustainability Performance Index."
"The table below provides an overview of the development of 
our forecast performance indicators and the target achieve-
ment level for these indicators in the 2023 fiscal year."

As part of a strategic review of the Care segment, the 
management decided to discontinue and sell these opera-
tions."
"Endeavors to sell the Care segment have begun and it 
is expected to have been sold before December 2024."
"The criteria for presentation as a disposal group held for sale 
are met."
"At the same time, the criteria for definition as a 
discontinued operation are also met."
"Accordingly, the 
majority of the segment is presented separately in the 
balance sheet as a disposal group held for sale/discontinued 
operation, and the results from the discontinued operation 
are shown separately in the income statement."
"Pursuant to 
IFRS 5, retrospective adjustments were made to presenta-
tion in the income statement; IFRS 5 does not provide for the

to be hived off."
"Intra-Group transactions were eliminated from the consoli-
dated financial results in full."
"The eliminations were allocat-
ed to continuing operations and discontinued operations so 
as to take account of the decision not to continue these

the 2023 annual financial statements, the earnings contribu-
tions from development to hold are recognized exclusively in 
net income from fair value adjustments of investment 
properties, i.e., outside of the Adjusted EBITDA Total."
"The 
adjusted presentation is due to the greater transparency and 
traceability of the key figures that are relevant to gover-
nance."
"Furthermore, the adjustment results in a more 
balanced presentation of the earnings situation in the 
Development segment now that market conditions have 
changed."
"The majority of the current Care segment, which is to be 
discontinued, is presented as a discontinued operation."
"This 
means that the Care segment is no longer included in the 
segment reporting."
"As part of a strategic review of the Care segment, the 
management decided to discontinue and sell these opera-
tions."
"Endeavors to sell the Care segment have since begun 
and it is expected to have been sold before December 2024."
"A small part of the segment, with a business volume of 
€ 23.3 million in segment revenue, was transferred to the

3 Consolidation Principles
Business Combinations
An entity shall account for each business combination by 
applying the acquisition method if it obtains control."
"All 
hidden reserves and charges of the company acquired are 
disclosed as part of the necessary remeasurement."
"Any 
excess of the cost of a business combination over the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities, following the disclosure of hidden reserves and 
charges, is recognized as goodwill in the balance sheet."
"The 
consideration transferred at the time of the acquisition and 
the identifiable net assets that are acquired are measured at 
fair value as a general rule."
"Transaction costs are recognized 
as an expense immediately insofar as they do not relate to 
costs pertaining to the raising of capital or the issue of debt 
capital."
"Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are companies that are controlled by the Group."
"The Group controls a company if it is exposed to risks or has 
rights to variable returns from its involvement with the 
company and has the ability to use its power of control over 
the company to influence the level of these returns."
"In the 
process of full consolidation, the assets and liabilities of a 
subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial state-
ments in their entirety."
"Subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date on which 
­
Vonovia SE obtains control until the day control ceases."
"Non-controlling Interests
The equity of a subsidiary that is not attributable to ­
Vonovia 
is shown as a separate component of equity under non-­
controlling interests."
"Non-controlling interests are measured 
based on their share of the identified net assets of the 
acquired company at the time of acquisition."
"Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that 
do not result in the parent losing control of the subsidiary 
are equity transactions."
"Transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to these equity transactions are reported in 
retained earnings without affecting net income."
"Loss of Control
If ­
Vonovia loses control over a subsidiary, the assets and 
liabilities of the subsidiary in question as well as any corre-
sponding non-controlling interests are derecognized."
"The 
result is recognized in the income statement."
"Any invest-
ment retained is recognized at fair value when control is lost."
"Associates and Joint Arrangements
Associates and joint arrangements classified as joint ven-
tures are accounted for using the equity method."
"An associ-
ate is an entity over which the investor has significant 
influence."
"A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights 
to the net assets of the arrangement."
"If the arrangement 
involves rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities 
of a joint arrangement instead, then these are recognized 
using quota consolidation."
"Business Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation
The effects of the business transactions between the entities 
included in the ­
Vonovia consolidated financial statements 
are eliminated."
"Results from business transactions with companies account-
ed for using the equity method are only eliminated in line 
with the Group’s share in the investee."
"The financial statements of ­
Vonovia SE and all subsidiaries 
are consistently prepared according to uniform accounting 
policies."
"Two domestic (December 31, 2022: three foreign) companies 
are no longer included in the scope of consolidation as they 
are no longer considered to be material."
"These companies 
are shown as non-consolidated affiliated companies."
"For all subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial 
statements, the reporting date is December 31."
"The
 list of ­
Vonovia shareholdings is appended to the Notes to 
the consolidated financial statements as an integral part 
thereof."
"Companies that have made use of the exemption provision 
set out in Section 264 (3) of the German Commercial Code 
(HGB) are marked accordingly in the list of shareholdings."
"The year-on-year changes in the consolidated companies as 
of December 31, 2023, result from four companies that were 
established, 22 mergers, two sales, two accruals and a 
liquidation."
"The change in joint ventures in 2023 is due to three sales, 
one merger and five disposals resulting from the conversion 
of these joint ventures into what are now associates."
"The 
number of associates changed by five additions in 2023 due 
to conversions, one sale and one disposal due to a loss of 
control resulting from a reduction in the stake held."
"The number of unconsolidated affiliated companies dropped 
in 2023 after one acquisition, the establishment of one 
company, and three sales."
"5 
Financial Reporting of Financial Assets and  
Financial Liabilities
Loans and Receivables
Loans and receivables are first recognized as incurred, other 
non-derivative financial assets as of the day of trading."
"The 
day of trading is the date on which ­
Vonovia becomes a 
contracting party of the financial instrument."
"All financial 
instruments are initially measured at fair value, taking 
account of transaction costs."
"Trade receivables are stated at 
the transaction price."
"A financial asset is derecognized when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 
asset expire, or the financial asset is transferred and ­
Vonovia 
neither retains control nor retains material risks and rewards 
associated with ownership of the financial asset."
"Loans and receivables are stated at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method."
"Impairments 
are identified for individual financial instruments when the 
counterparty has defaulted or breached a contract or there 
are indications of risks of impairments due to a rating 
downgrade and general information (loss event)."
"For groups 
of financial instruments with similar risks, historical default 
probabilities in relation to the time overdue are drawn upon 
(loss event)."
"An impairment is calculated after the occur-
rence of a loss event as the difference between the carrying 
amount and the value of the discounted estimated future 
cash flow."
"The original effective interest rate is taken as the 
discount rate."
"Impairment losses are recognized with effect 
on net income and offset directly with the carrying amount 
of the financial instrument."
"Any interest income on impaired 
financial instruments is still recognized."
"If there are indica-
tions that the amount of the impairment loss will be smaller, 
this reduction is credited to the financial instrument affect-
ing net income to the extent that the sum does not exceed 
the amortized cost that would have been recognized if the 
impairment had not occurred."
"Consolidated Financial Statements — Notes
164
Derivative Financial Instruments and Put Options
Derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value 
on the day of trading when they are recognized for the first 
time."
"The fair values of the derivative financial instruments 
are calculated using standard market valuation methods for 
such instruments on the basis of the market data available 
on the valuation date."
"With derivatives that are not designated as a hedging 
instrument in the balance sheet, changes in the fair value are 
recognized in profit or loss with effect on net income."
"At the time of application of IFRS 9, ­
Vonovia will opt to 
continue to apply the hedge accounting provisions set out in 
IAS 39 as opposed to the provisions of IFRS 9."
"­
Vonovia 
applies this accounting method to all hedge relationships."
"Contracts concluded for the purpose of receiving or supply-
ing non-financial items in accordance with the company’s 
expected purchase, sale, or use requirements (own-use 
contracts) are not recognized as derivative financial instru-
ments, but rather as pending transactions under IAS 37."
"> With a cash flow hedge, the unrealized gains and losses 
are initially recognized in other comprehensive income to 
the extent that the hedge is effective."
"Amounts accumulat-
ed in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the 
income statement at the same time the underlying hedged 
item affects net income."
"To the extent that the hedge is 
ineffective, the change in fair value is immediately recog-
nized in net interest."
"As soon as the 
derivative is to be separated from its host contract, the 
individual components of the hybrid financial instrument are 
to be accounted for based on the provisions that apply to the 
individual financial instruments."
"In order to measure interest rate swaps, future cash flows 
are calculated and then discounted."
"The calculated cash 
flows result from the contract conditions."
"The contract 
conditions regularly refer to the EURIBOR/STIBOR reference 
rates (3M and 6M EURIBOR/STIBOR)."
"Discounting is based 
on market interest rate data as of the reporting date for 
comparable instruments (EURIBOR/STIBOR rate of the 
same tenor)."
"The fair value contains the credit risk of the 
interest rate swaps and therefore allows for adjustments for 
the company’s own credit risk or for the counterparty credit 
risk."
"To measure the cross currency swaps, future cash flows are 
calculated and then discounted."
"The calculated cash flows 
result from the contract conditions and the forward rates 
(development of exchange rates expected by the market)."
"Discounting is based on market interest rate data as of the 
reporting date for comparable instruments (EURIBOR rate of 
the same tenor)."
"The fair value contains the credit risk of the 
cross currency swaps and therefore allows for adjustments 
for the company’s own credit risk or for the counterparty 
credit risk."

Equity Instruments to Be Recognized at Fair Value in  
Other Comprehensive Income
In general, the equity instruments to be recognized at fair 
value in other comprehensive income are shares in compa-
nies that were acquired with long-term strategic intentions."
"These equity instruments to be recognized at fair value in 
other comprehensive income are initially stated at their fair 
value, plus the directly attributable transaction costs."
Subsequent measurement is at fair value as a general rule.
"Changes in the fair value are recognized in other compre-
hensive income."
"The fair value of equity instruments to be recognized at fair 
value in other comprehensive income is based on quoted 
market prices as of the reporting date where they are 
available."
"If no market price is available, the fair value is 
calculated using a discounted cash flow model."
"If these 
equity instruments are derecognized, the cumulative gain or 
loss recognized in other comprehensive income is trans-
ferred to retained earnings, not affecting net income."
"Inter-
est on interest-bearing financial instruments of this category 
is calculated using the effective interest method."
"Dividends 
on equity instruments in this category are shown in the 
income statement."
"6 Currency Translation
Accounting Policies
Foreign currency transactions involving Group companies are converted 
into the functional currency, in accordance with the temporal method, at 
the exchange rate that applies on the day of the transaction."
"Monetary 
balance sheet items denominated in a foreign currency are converted 
at the exchange rate that applies on each reporting date."
"Any exchange 
differences are recognized affecting net income."
"Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost are recorded on the reporting date 
at the exchange rate on the date they were first recognized."
"Non-monetary 
items that are measured at fair value are translated on the reporting date 
using the exchange rate on the date the fair value was determined."
"Ex-
change differences relating to non-monetary items are recognized affecting 
net income insofar as a profit or loss on the corresponding line item is also 
recognized affecting net income."
"Otherwise, they are disclosed in other 
comprehensive income."
"The main foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial state-
ments operate their business independently in line with functional theory."
"The annual financial statements of those subsidiaries whose functional 
currency is not the euro are converted into the reporting currency using the 
modified closing rate method."
"The functional currency of individual foreign 
units is always the respective local currency."
"Any resulting exchange dif-
ferences are disclosed as a separate item in other comprehensive income."
"When a foreign subsidiary leaves the scope of consolidation, the cumulative 
exchange differences are reversed and recognized in profit or loss."
"­
Vonovia applies the concept of functional currency transla-
tion in accordance with IAS 21 “Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates” to its consolidated financial statements."
"The functional currency of ­
Vonovia SE and the reporting 
currency of the ­
Vonovia Group is the euro."
"The exchange rates of the currencies relevant to the ­
Vonovia 
Group have developed as follows:
Closing rate
Average for period
Basis: € 1
Dec."
"Government grants that do not relate to investments are regularly recog-
nized as income in the periods in which the relevant expenses are incurred."
"Expenses subsidies granted in the form of rent, interest and other expenses 
subsidies are recorded as income in the periods in which the expenses are 
incurred and shown within other revenue from property management."
"Low-interest loans are government grants that are recognized at their 
present value within the non-derivative financial liabilities on the basis of 
the market interest rate at the time the loans are taken out."
"The difference 
between face value and present value is recognized as deferred income with 
an effect on net income over the maturity term in the line with the fixed-­
interest-rate period of the corresponding loans."
"Where the low-interest loans are granted in the context of capitalized mod-
ernization measures, the deferred income item is reversed in proportion to 
depreciation, or, with investment properties that are measured based on the 
fair value model, over 12.5 years."
"The companies that belong to the Group receive government 
grants in the form of construction subsidies, expenses 
subsidies, expenses loans and low-interest loans."
"In the 2023 
fiscal year, ­
Vonovia was granted low-interest loans of 
€ 580.6 million (2022: € 109.7 million)."

Changes in Accounting Policies, Estimates,  
Assumptions, Options and Judgments
Changes to Key Accounting Methods
As of January 1, 2023, the Group did not have to apply any 
interest rate benchmark reform."
"Group financial instruments are exposed to IBORs that are 
not being replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide 
initiatives."
"The biggest risk for the Group in connection with 
the IBOR as of December 31, 2023, was the link to the 
EURIBOR and STIBOR."
"As these are expected to remain valid 
until at least 2025, no changes had to be made to the finan-
cial instruments in the period leading up to December 
31, 2023, meaning that no new interest rate benchmarks have 
to be reflected here."
"The LIBOR administrator regulated and licensed by the UK 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the ICE Benchmark 
Administration (IBA), ceased publication of the USD LIBOR 
at the end of June 2023."
"The Group does not hold any 
financial instruments that are subject to the USD LIBOR."
"The IBOR risks to which the Group was exposed as of 
December 31, 2023, largely relate to corporate bonds and 
loans linked to the EURIBOR/STIBOR."
"As explained above, 
the Group has not had to make any changes to the contrac-
tual terms for risks resulting from a link to the EURIBOR/
STIBOR."
"The EURIBOR calculation method changed in the course 
of 2019."
"In July 2019, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets 
Authority approved the EURIBOR in accordance with the 
European Union Benchmarks Regulation."
"This allows market 
participants to keep using the EURIBOR for both existing and 
new contracts for the time being."
"­
Vonovia is keeping an eye 
on current developments related to the introduction of a 
potential EURIBOR successor, the ESTR-based EFTERM."
"Derivatives
The Group holds interest rate swaps and other derivatives 
designated in hedging relationships to hedge cash flows for 
risk management purposes."
"The variable amounts of the 
interest rate swaps are linked to EURIBOR/STIBOR."
"Hedge Accounting
The Group’s hedged items and hedging instruments are 
linked to the EURIBOR as of the reporting date."
"These 
reference rates are quoted daily and the IBOR cash flows are 
exchanged with the counterparties as usual."
"Changes in Accounting Policies Due to New Standards  
and Interpretations
The following new or amended standards and interpreta-
tions became mandatory for the first time in the 2023 fiscal 
year."
"With the exception of the adjustments explained below 
related to IAS 12, this did not have any material effects on 
­
Vonovia’s consolidated financial statements."
"A two-pillar solution was devel-
oped as part of this international tax reform, with the second 
pillar (Pillar 2) addressing global effective minimum taxation, 
in particular."
"The implementation status of the Pillar 2 tax regulations in 
terms of their transposition into national law varies consid-
erably from country to country."
"These were adopted by 
the EU in November 2023 and already apply for the 2023 
reporting year."
"In addition to a mandatory exception from the recognition of 
deferred taxes in connection with the Pillar 2 rules, the 
amendments include, in particular, extended disclosures in 
the notes."
"While the exception is designed explicitly as a 
temporary one, the IASB has not yet set any expiration date."
"­
Vonovia is applying the extended regulations set out in IAS 
12 as planned as of the 2023 fiscal year."
"The impact on the 
Group and the required disclosures in the notes are set out 
in note
 [B22] Income Taxes."
"New Standards and Interpretations Not Yet Applied
Application of the following standards, interpretations and 
amendments to existing standards was not yet mandatory 
for the 2023 fiscal year."
"­
Vonovia also did not choose to apply 
them in advance."
"It is expected that the application of the 
new or amended standards and interpretations will have no 
material effects on ­
Vonovia’s consolidated financial state-
ments."
"Their application will be mandatory for the fiscal 
years following the dates stated in the following table:

"The actual amounts may differ from the estimates as the 
business environment may develop differently than as-
sumed."
"In this case, the assumptions and, where necessary, 
the carrying amounts of the assets or liabilities affected are 
prospectively adjusted accordingly."
"Specific estimates and 
assumptions relating to individual elements of financial 
statements are also explained in the corresponding notes to 
the consolidated financial statements."
"Assumptions and estimates are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis and are based on experience and other factors, includ-
ing expectations regarding future events that appear reason-
able under the given circumstances."
"The estimates and assumptions that may have a material 
risk of causing an adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities mainly relate to the determination of 
the fair value of investment properties."
"The best evidence of fair value of investment properties is 
current prices in an active market for comparable residential 
properties."
"As such information is not completely available, 
however, ­
Vonovia uses standard valuation techniques."
"Consolidated Financial Statements — Notes

A detailed description of the discounted cash flow (DCF) 
method used can be found in chapter
 [D28] Investment 
Properties."
"In accordance with IAS 40 in conjunction with IFRS 13, the 
respective market values of the investment properties 
owned by ­
Vonovia are determined."
"Changes in certain 
market conditions such as prevailing rent levels and vacancy 
rates may affect the valuation of investment properties."
"Any 
changes in the fair value of the investment portfolio are 
recognized as part of the profit for the period in the income 
statement and can thus substantially affect ­
Vonovia’s results 
of operations."
"The statement of financial liabilities at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method takes the expected contractual 
cash flows into account."
"In some cases, the agreements do 
not have any fixed maturity terms."
"As a result, the cash 
flows included in the valuation are subject to management 
assumptions in terms of amount and term."
"As explained in chapter
 [D26] Intangible Assets, ­
Vonovia 
checks for goodwill impairments on an annual basis, or if 
there is any reason to suspect such impairments."
"The next 
step involves determining the recoverable amount of the 
group of cash-generating units (CGU)."
"This corresponds to 
either the fair value less costs of sale or the value in use, 
whichever is higher."
"Determining the value in use includes 
adjustments and estimates regarding the forecast and 
discounting of the future cash flow."
"Although the manage-
ment believes that the assumptions used to determine the 
recoverable amount are appropriate, any unforeseeable 
changes in these assumptions could result in impairment 
losses, with a detrimental impact on the net assets, 
­
financial position and results of operations."
"When determining the volume of current and deferred taxes, 
the Group takes into account the effects of uncertain tax 
items and whether additional taxes and interest may be due."
"This assessment is made on the basis of estimates and 
assumptions about future events."
"New information may 
become available that causes the Group to change its 
discretionary decisions regarding the appropriateness of 
existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will 
affect the tax expense in the period in which such a change 
is made."
"Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it can 
be demonstrated that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the temporary differ-
ence can be utilized."
"Deferred tax assets are reviewed at 
each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that there will be sufficient future taxable 
profits to realize the tax benefit in the future."
"In connection with the application of IFRS 15, it is assumed 
with respect to determining progress in relation to revenue 
recognition over time that the costs incurred appropriately 
reflect the progress as a share of total costs."
"Additional estimates and assumptions mainly relate to the 
uniform definition of useful lives, the assumptions made on 
the value of land and buildings, the recognition and mea-
surement of provisions as well as the realization of future tax 
benefits."
"Climate risks have an impact on ­
Vonovia’s business model 
and strategy."
"They are addressed in particular by the climate 
path that the company has mapped out, but also by appro-
priate estimates and assumptions in key items of the com-
pany’s net assets, financial position and results of opera-
tions."
"Climate risks can have a potentially negative impact 
and result in increased estimation uncertainties."
"Physical climate risks refer to longer-term shifts in general 
climatic conditions."
"Climate events such as floods, earth-
quakes, extreme weather events, etc."
"could have an impact 
on our real estate portfolio and require specific crisis man-
agement measures."
"Climate transition risks describe the 
effects that can arise for companies due to the process of 
transformation towards a more sustainable economic 
system."
"As part of its sustainability strategy, ­
Vonovia has made a 
commitment to climate protection targets and a virtually 
carbon-neutral housing stock by 2045."
"Based on our current 
knowledge and expectations regarding future developments, 
this will not have any impact on ­
Vonovia’s balance sheet."
"This relates,  among other things, to the fair values of invest-
ment properties, specific useful lives and the value of assets, 
as well as provisions for environmental risks, for which no 
significant need for adjustment emerges."
"> Determining whether the acquisition of investment 
properties as part of a business combination constitutes 
the acquisition of a “business” or the acquisition of an 
individual asset or group of assets can involve discretion-
ary judgments."
"> ­
Vonovia measures investment properties at fair value."
"If 
management had opted to use the acquisition costs model 
as permitted under IAS 40, the carrying amounts of the 
investment properties as well as the corresponding income 
and expense items in the income statement would differ 
significantly."
"> The criteria for assessing in which category a financial 
asset is to be classified may involve discretionary 
­
judgments."
"> Within the scope of revenue recognition in accordance 
with IFRS 15, discretionary decisions relating to the expect-
ed revenue, the total costs of a project and the degree of 
completion may be necessary."
"These have an impact on 
the amount and timing of revenue."
"> When accounting for leases in accordance with IFRS 16, 
the assessment of the exercise or non-exercise of unilater-
ally granted termination or renewal options may involve 
discretionary judgment, particularly if there is no economic 
incentive for the exercise or non-exercise of options."
"> The need to include information concerning the future in 
the valuation of expected defaults results in discretionary 
decisions regarding the impact that changes in economic 
factors will have on the expected defaults."
"> The decision on how to define a group of cash-generating 
units to which goodwill is allocated may involve 
­
discretionary judgments."
"> Allocating the goodwill to the group of individual 
cash-generating units may also involve discretionary 
judgments."
"The parameters used in the impairment test, 
such as the determination of undiscounted cash flows, the 
weighted average cost of capital and the growth rate, may 
also involve discretionary judgments."
"Due to a lack of any 
detailed definition of the term “operation” (IAS 36.86), the 
disposal of goodwill within the context of real estate sales 
may involve discretionary decisions."
"> Defining a disposal group when selling properties can 
involve a discretionary decision."
"Due to a lack of any 
detailed definition of the term “a separate major line of 
business or geographical area of operations” (IFRS 5), 
classification as a discontinued operation may involve 
discretionary decisions."
"Assessing whether a sale is 
deemed to be highly probable within the space of a year 
can also involve a discretionary decision."
"> At the moment, there are no definitive provisions on how 
to reflect a mandatory acquisition of non-controlling 
interests following the acquisition of control as part of a 
voluntary public takeover offer."
"In general, the acquisition 
of shares as part of a public offer during the second offer 
period is based on exactly the same conditions as those 
that applied in the first offer period, and the two acquisi-
tions are closely related in terms of content and timing."
"This means that, even if it is executed in two offer periods, 
the acquisition constitutes one and the same transaction 
(linked transaction)."

Profit on Disposal of Real Estate Inventories
Accounting Policies
Revenue from disposal of real estate inventories is realized either over time 
or at a specific point in time as soon as the customer obtains control over 
the asset in question."
"If, upon conclusion of the certified purchase agree-
ment, control within the meaning of IFRS 15.35 (c) passes to the customer 
before or during the construction phase, the revenue is to be recognized as 
of this point in time based on the degree of completion of the construction 
project."
"Disclosure of the contract assets that fall within the scope of IFRS 15 
occurs on a net basis with the corresponding advance payments received 
under trade receivables."
"Contractual balances with an expected term of less than one year are not 
adjusted to reflect the time value of money."
"No separate agreements are reached, in the contracts on the sale of 
apartments as part of the development business, on extraordinary rights 
of return or rescission, meaning that such rights are based on the relevant 
legal provisions."
"The same applies to warranty commitments, which are not 
to be treated as a separate contractual component within the meaning of 
IFRS 15 as a result."
"Existing warranty claims are always accounted for in line 
with the provisions of IAS 37."
"In accordance with IFRS 15.94, costs for the initiation of the contracts with 
customers are recognized as an expense as soon as they are incurred, as the 
depreciation period generally would not amount to more than a year."
"The 
costs relate primarily to brokerage commission."
"In cases involving revenue recognition over time, the percentage of com-
pletion/progress made has to be assessed."
"­
Vonovia uses the cost-to-cost 
method, as an input-based procedure, for this purpose."
"The progress made 
is determined based on the ratio of the capitalized contract costs incurred 
up until the reporting date to the estimated total contract costs that can be 
capitalized."
"As of the reporting date, contract assets of € 70.1 million 
(2022: € 169.2 million) are recognized within miscellaneous 
other assets in connection with the period-related revenue 
recognition."
"As of the reporting date, this amount includes 
advance payments received of € 76.4 million (2022: 
€ 172.6 million)."
"The previous year was dominated by the 
transfer of benefits and encumbrances for a project in Berlin 
in connection with the sale to an individual investor (global 
exit)."
"A transaction price of € 45.4 million (2022: € 93.3 million) is

Net Income from Fair Value Adjustment of  
Investment Properties
Investment properties are generally measured by the 
in-house valuation department according to the fair value 
model."
"The fair value for the nursing care properties are 
calculated by independent experts using a DCF method and 
are adjusted, where appropriate, based on findings from 
market observation and transactions."
"Any gains or losses 
from a change in fair value are recognized in the income 
statement affecting net income."
"The measurement of the investment properties led to a 
valuation loss of € -10,651.2 million in the 2023 fiscal year 
(2022: € -1,177.6 million) (see
 [D28] Investment Properties)."
"This includes € -14.8 million (2022: € 22.6 million) for the 
measurement of right-of-use assets (IFRS 16)."
"The figure also includes the valuation result from buildings 
under construction (new construction/development to hold) 
that were completed during the reporting period and were 
moved to the Rental portfolio."
"A fair value measurement is 
performed for the first time when the properties are com-
pleted."
"This resulted in a valuation effect of € 14.2 million in 
the 2023 fiscal year (2022: € 90.8 million)."
"In the fiscal year under review, employers’ contributions to 
statutory pension insurance amounted to € 52.1 mil-
lion (2022: € 51.3 million)."
"As of December 31, 2023, ­
Vonovia had a workforce of 11,977 
employees (December 31, 2022: 12,117)."
"3,474 employees 
were female as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022:

"22 Income Taxes
Accounting Policies
Income taxes for the current and prior fiscal years are recognized as current 
income tax liabilities to the extent that they have not yet been paid."
"The 
current tax expense is determined on the basis of the taxable income for the 
fiscal year."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using the liability method 
under the temporary concept, providing for all temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in 
the consolidated financial statements."
"The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting 
date."
"If necessary, the carrying amount of the deferred tax asset is reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer offset by deferred tax liabilities that can be 
netted against it or that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available in the future."
"Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that apply, or are expected to 
apply, to the period when the tax asset is realized or the liability is settled 
based on the current legislation in the countries in question."
"As in 2022, the 
combined tax rate of corporate income tax and trade tax of 33.1% was used 
to calculate domestic deferred taxes for 2023."
"The corporate income tax 
rate for the companies based in Austria is 23.0% based on the expecta-
tion announced for 2024, while the rate for companies based in Sweden 
is 20.6%."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted against each other only if 
­
Vonovia has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, 
when the same tax authority is involved and when the realization period 
is the same."
"In accordance with the regulations of IAS 12 “Income Taxes,” 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted."
"Including trade tax at a rate of about 
17.3% (2022: 17.3%), the combined domestic tax rate is 33.1% 
in 2023 (2022:33.1%)."
"The corporate income tax rate for the 
companies based in Austria is 24.0% (2022: 25.0%), while 
the rate for the companies in Sweden comes to 20.6% 
(2022: 20.6%)."
"The income generated by ­
Vonovia Finance 
B.V."
"is subject to Dutch tax law; current taxes of € 1.4 million 
(2022: € 2.4 million) were incurred there."
"The other compa-
nies that hold properties and are based in the Netherlands 
have limited corporation tax liability in Germany."
"These 
companies, together with the other foreign companies, 
pay tax that is of a negligible amount from the Group’s 
­
perspective in the countries in which they are domiciled."
For deductible temporary differences (excl.
"loss carryfor-
wards) in the amount of € 90.9 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 88.2 million), no deferred corporate income taxes or 
deferred trade taxes were recognized, because they are not 
likely to be used in the future."
"The drop in tax loss carryforwards resulted 
from current tax gains at individual companies and the 
associated utilization of the loss carryforwards."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
175
No deferred taxes were recognized in the balance sheet for 
domestic and foreign corporate income tax loss carryfor-
wards amounting to € 1,461.5 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 1,342.7 million)."
"Of this amount, € 25.9 million arose for the 
first time in the 2023 fiscal year (2022: € 23.4 million)."
"Under 
current tax law, these loss carryforwards are not subject to 
restrictions either with regard to time or the amount of the 
loss carryforward."
"The fact that no deferred tax assets were 
recognized on the new corporate income tax loss carryfor-
wards results in a tax effect of € 4.2 million (2022: € 3.7 mil-
lion)."
"In addition, there are further trade tax loss carryfor-
wards subject to no restrictions with regard to how they can 
be carried forward in the amount of € 728.5 million in total 
(December 31, 2022: € 624.4 million)."
"These did not give rise 
to any deferred tax assets."
"Of this amount, € 21.2 million 
arose for the first time in the 2023 fiscal year (2022: 
€ 22.2 million) and the resulting tax effect is € 3.5 million 
(2022: € 3.7 million)."
"The remeasurement of deferred tax assets on temporary 
differences and loss carryforwards from the previous year 
led to tax expense amounting to € 31.6 million in the 2023 
fiscal year (2022: income of € 8.2 million)."
"The increase is 
mainly due to the remeasurement of the tax loss carryfor-
ward of a company that was included in a tax group for 
income tax purposes in 2023."
"Deferred taxes on interest carryforwards are recognized if 
the interest carryforward is likely to be able to be used in the 
future."
"Due to the Group’s capital structure, no interest 
carryforwards are likely to be able to be used in the future."
"As a result, no deferred tax assets have been recognized on 
domestic interest carryforwards in the amount of € 1,598.0 
million (December 31, 2022: € 1,340.7 million)."
"€ 257.3 million 
of this amount arose for the first time in the reporting year 
(2022: € 223.9 million)."
"The fact that no deferred tax assets 
were recognized on the new interest carryforward generated 
a tax effect of € 87.6 million in Germany (2022: € 71.4 million)."
"Sweden has had a regulation similar to the German interest 
threshold since 2019."
"As a result, no deferred tax assets have 
been recognized on interest carryforwards in the amount of 
€ 162.3 million in Sweden (2022: € 144.7 million)."
"Of this 
amount, € 33.0 million (2022: € 32.7 million) arose for the first 
time in the reporting year."
"The fact that no deferred taxes 
were recognized generated a tax effect of € 6.8 million in 
Sweden (2022: € 6.7 million)."
"A reconciliation between disclosed effective income taxes 
and expected tax expense, which is the product of the 
accounting profit for the period multiplied by the average tax 
rate applicable in Germany, is shown in the table below."

€ 57,216.9 million), as these profits are to remain invested for 
an indefinite period or are not subject to taxation."
"In the event 
of distribution or disposal of the subsidiaries, 5% of the 
distributed amounts or the capital gains would be subject 
to German taxation so that there would normally be an 
additional tax obligation."
"The Group falls within 
the scope of these regulations."
"­
Vonovia carried out an initial indicative analysis as of the 
reporting date to identify the general impact of the legisla-
tion and the jurisdictions from which the Group is exposed 
to potential effects in connection with a Pillar 2 top-up tax."
"The first step involved checking whether the CbCR (Country- 
­
by-Country Reporting) safe harbor regulations were 
relevant."
"If a country was not exempt from the Pillar 2 
calculation based on a review of the safe harbor regulations, 
the effective tax rate was calculated on a simplified basis."
"This initial indicative analysis did not identify any countries 
in connection with which ­
Vonovia would be affected by a 
Pillar 2 top-up tax."
"As a result, ­
Vonovia currently assumes 
that the Pillar 2 top-up tax does not apply."
"This means that 
the average effective Group tax rate would not have changed 
had the Pillar 2 legislation already been in force on the 
balance sheet date."
"The Group monitors progress made in the legislative process 
in every country in which ­
Vonovia operates."
"­
Vonovia applies the exception provided for in IAS 12, based 
on which no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized 
in connection with OECD Pillar 2 income taxes and no 
disclosures are made in this regard either."
"Section (C): Other Disclosures on the Results 
of Operations
23 Segment Reporting
­
Vonovia is an integrated residential real estate company 
with operations across Europe."
"The company’s strategy is 
focused on sustainably increasing the value of the company."
"For the 
purposes of managing the company, we make a distinction 
between four segments Rental, Value-add, Recurring Sales 
and Development at the end of 2023."
"We also report the 
Other segment, which is not relevant from a corporate 
management perspective, in our segment reporting."
"Ancillary costs are also reported under 
“Other.”
The majority of the current Care segment, which is to be 
discontinued, is presented as a discontinued operation."
"As 
part of the strategic review of the Care business area, the 
management had already adopted a plan to sell the Care 
segment back in the 2021 fiscal year."
"Endeavors to sell the 
Care segment have since begun and it is expected to have 
been sold before December 2024."
"A small part of the Care 
segment, with a business volume of € 23.3 million in segment 
revenue, was transferred to the Rental segment."
"Specifically, 
this relates to rental income for 25 properties operated by 
third parties."
"The previous year’s figures were adjusted 
accordingly."
"The Rental segment combines all of the business activities 
that are aimed at the value-enhancing management of our 
own residential real estate."
"It includes our property manage-
ment activities in Germany, Austria and Sweden."
"The 
consolidation of our property management activities in 
Germany, Austria and Sweden to form one single reporting 
segment is based on the similarities that we see in the 
property management business in these three countries."
"This applies to the way in which services are provided and 
the individual service processes that form part of the 
­
property management business as well as to the customers 
in the residential rental market and the type of customer 
acquisition used."
"Consolidated Financial Statements — Notes
178
Overall, the residential rental market in all three countries is 
characterized by a shortage of housing and is regulated by 
statutory requirements, resulting in return expectations that 
are similar in the long term."
"The Value-add segment bundles all of the housing-related 
services that we have expanded our core rental business to 
include."
"These services include both the maintenance and 
modernization work on our residential properties and 
services that are closely related to the rental business."
"We allocate the activities relating to the craftsmen’s and 
residential environment organization, the condominium 
administration business, the cable TV business, metering 
services, energy supplies and our insurance services to the 
Value-add segment."
"The Recurring Sales segment includes the regular and 
sustainable disposals of individual condominiums and 
single-family houses from our portfolio."
"The consolidation 
of our sales activities in Germany and Austria to form one 
single reporting segment is based on the similarities that 
we see in the property management business in these two 
countries."
"It does not include the sale of entire buildings or 
land (Non Core/Other)."
"These properties are only sold as 
and when the right opportunities present themselves, 
meaning that the sales do not form part of the Recurring 
Sales segment."
"We report these opportunistic sales in the 
Other column of the segment report."
"The Development segment combines cross-country devel-
opment activities and includes the project development of 
new residential buildings."
"The consolidation of our develop-
ment activities in Germany, Austria and Sweden to form one 
single reporting segment is based on the similarities that we 
see in the business in these three countries."
"The business 
covers the value chain starting with the purchase of land 
without any development plan/dedicated purpose and 
ending with the completion and sale of new buildings and 
new construction measures on our own properties."
"These 
properties are either incorporated into our own portfolio or 
sold to third parties."
"In the previous years, the Adjusted EBITDA of the Develop-
ment segment included the fair value step-up for properties 
that were completed in the reporting period and had been 
added to our own portfolio."
"At the end of the fourth quarter 
of 2023, the presentation of contributions to earnings made 
by the Development to hold sales channel was adjusted 
within the Development segment."
"Details are set out in the 
Notes under Adjustment to Prior-year Figures."
"In the future, 
all earnings contributions made by Development to hold 
will be recognized in the valuation results, i.e., outside of 
segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA."
"This brings the management approach into the IFRS stan-
dard governing the measurement of investment properties 
(IAS 40)."
"The previous year’s figures were adjusted 
­
accordingly."
"Planning and controlling systems ensure that resources are 
efficiently allocated and their successful use is monitored on 
a regular basis."
"Reporting to the chief decision-makers and 
thus the assessment of economic performance as well as 
the allocation of resources are performed on the basis of 
this segmentation."
"Asset and liability items are not reported 
separately by segment."
"Internal reporting is based on the 
IFRS reporting standards in general."

Accounting Policies
Acquired other intangible assets are stated at amortized cost."
"Internally 
generated other intangible assets are stated at amortized cost provided 
that the requirements of IAS 38 for the capitalization of internally generated 
intangible assets are met."
"Acquired trademark rights that are identified 
have an indefinite useful life and are subject to regular impairment testing."
"All of ­
Vonovia’s miscellaneous other intangible assets have definite useful 
lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives."
"Software and licenses are amortized on the basis of a useful life of 
three years."
"In accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets,” other intangible assets 
are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication of an impairment."
Impairment testing is performed at least once a year.
"An impairment loss 
is recognized when an asset’s recoverable amount is less than its carrying 
amount."
"If the recoverable amount cannot be determined for the individual 
asset, the impairment test is conducted on the cash generating unit (CGU) 
to which the asset belongs."
"Impairment losses are recognized as expenses 
in the income statement affecting net income."
"An impairment loss recognized for prior periods is reversed if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s (or the CGU’s) 
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized."
"The car-
rying amount of the asset (or the CGU) is increased to the newly estimated 
recoverable amount."
"The carrying amount is limited to the amount that 
would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognized in 
prior years for the asset (or the CGU)."
"Customer Relationships and Similar Values
Customer relationships for activities in the Care segment 
with definite useful lives of between five and six years were 
allocated to the assets of the discontinued operations in the 
fiscal year under review."
"The acquired “BUWOG” brand name for the development 
business was written off in full in the amount of € 66.6 mil-
lion as part of an (ad hoc) impairment test conducted in the 
second quarter of 2023 for the Development segment."
"Information on the approach to impairment testing can be 
found in the subchapter
 “Goodwill”."
"Goodwill
Accounting Policies
Goodwill results from a business combination and is defined as the amount 
by which the total consideration for shares in a company or group of com-
panies exceeds the pro rata net assets acquired."
"The net assets are the total 
of the identifiable assets acquired that are valued at fair value in accordance 
with IFRS 3 as well as the assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities."
"Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but rather is subjected to impair-
ment testing on an annual basis."
"It is also tested for impairment whenever 
events or circumstances indicating an impairment arise."
"The impairment testing of goodwill is performed at the level of cash 
generating units (CGUs) or a group of CGUs."
"A CGU is the smallest group 
of assets which generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows generated by other assets or other groups of assets."
"Goodwill 
purchased as part of a business combination is allocated to the CGUs or 
groups of CGUs that are expected to produce benefits resulting from the 
synergy effects of the combination."
"At ­
Vonovia, each property meets the requirements for classification as a 
CGU as a general rule."
"As part of operational management, these properties 
are grouped first of all to form geographically structured business units 
and then to form regional business areas."
"Since the regional business areas 
are the lowest level within the company at which goodwill is monitored for 
internal management purposes, the impairment test is performed at busi-
ness area level and, as a result, in accordance with IAS 36.80 for a group of 
CGUs."
"The acquired assets are allocated to the business areas based on the 
geographical location of the properties."
"A further group of CGUs for which 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes relates to the 
Value-add Business segment."
"The third group of CGUs, to which goodwill 
was allocated and monitored for management purposes, relates to the De-
velopment segment."
"As a result of the acquisition of ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen SE, 
the Care segment was added as a further CGU, which was also monitored 
for internal management purposes."
"The corresponding balance sheet items 
are presented as a discontinued operation and have been reclassified to the 
assets of discontinued operations."
"The group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment on a regular basis."
"This involves comparing the recoverable 
amount with the carrying amount of the group of CGUs."
"The recoverable 
amount of the group of CGUs is either its value in use or fair value less costs 
of sale, whichever is higher."
"When calculating the value in use, the estimat-
ed future cash flows are discounted to their cash value."
"Discount rates be-
fore tax are used that reflect the current market assessment of the interest 
rate effect and the specific risks associated with the regional business areas 
and the Value-add, Development and Care segments."
"If goodwill has been allocated to a group of CGUs and its carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount, the goodwill is to be written down in the 
amount of the difference in the first instance."
"Any need for impairment in 
excess of this amount is distributed among the other assets in the group of 
CGUs in proportion to their carrying amount."
"The individual fair value less 
costs to sell, value in use or zero must not be undercut in this regard."
"Impairment losses that have been realized as part of the valuation of good-
will are not reversed in the following years."

The carrying amount of goodwill came to € 1,391.7 million as 
of December 31, 2023."
"This means that goodwill has dropped 
by € 138.2 million compared with December 31, 2022."
"The 
change is due to the impairment of € 138.2 million in the 
second quarter of 2023 identified as part of the (ad hoc) 
impairment test performed in the second quarter of 2023."
"The increased cost of capital in the Development business 
area and adjusted cash flow planning in the Development 
business area to reflect the current market situation were 
classified as triggering events within the meaning of IAS 36."
"The impairment test conducted as of June 30, 2023, resulted 
in the goodwill for the Development business area of 
€ 138.2 million being written off in full."
"In addition, trademark rights in the Development business 
area classified as having an indefinite useful life in the 
amount of € 66.6 million were also written off in full."
"This led 
to an impairment of € 204.8 million in the second quarter 
of 2023 for goodwill and trademark rights."
"In accordance with IAS 36.19, first the value in use was 
calculated based on the Management Board-approved 
detailed plan with a planning period of five years."
"This was 
derived from the five-year plan at Group level approved 
by the Management Board and acknowledged by the 
­
Supervisory Board."
"The assumptions used to calculate the 
value in use match the assumptions used for the purposes 
of the impairment test at the end of 2022."
"The main parameters for calculating the value in use are the 
sustainable rate of increase, the average total cost of capital 
(WACC) and the expected cash flows."
"Parameters for WACC Calculation for the  
Development Segment
Dec."
"This also forms part of the five-year 
plan for the Group as a whole as approved by the Manage-
ment Board and acknowledged by the Supervisory Board."
"The plan is based on assessments regarding the develop-
ment of the operating business areas in terms of future 
revenue, expenses and margins, and taking current market 
developments into account."
"The regular annual impairment test was performed for the 
Value-add group of CGUs as of December 31, 2023."
"The 
value of the goodwill for the Value-add group of CGUs was 
ultimately confirmed."
"Developments in the Value-add 
segment are characterized primarily by the extension of 
existing business areas (craftsmen’s organization, 
­
multimedia, management of residential property, smart 
metering, energy service, etc.)."
"On the other hand, there is 
an increase in operating expenses, taking into account the 
rate of inflation."
"The development in these values is in line 
with past experiences of business model development."
"The cash flows from the last detailed planning year were 
derived to calculate the perpetual annuity."

Accounting Policies
Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at amortized cost 
less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated over their respective 
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis."
"In accordance with IAS 36 
“Impairment of Assets,” impairment tests are performed whenever there is 
an indication of an impairment."
"Subsequent costs of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equip-
ment are capitalized provided it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to ­
Vonovia and the cost can be estimated 
reliably."
"The properties used by the company itself are subject to depreciation over 
a term of 50 years, with fixtures, furniture and office equipment subject to 
depreciation over a period of 3–13 years and technical equipment, plant and 
machinery over a period of 5–20 years."
"Carrying amounts of owner-occupied properties amounting 
to € 92.0 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 
31, 2022: € 79.5 million) are encumbered with land charges 
in favor of various lenders."
"28 Investment Properties
in € million
As of Jan."
"31, 2023
81,120.3
As of Jan."
"Investment properties are properties that are held for the purpose of 
earning rental income or for capital appreciation or both and are not owner-­
occupied or held for sale in the ordinary course of business."
"Investment 
properties include undeveloped land, land and land rights including build-
ings and land with hereditary building rights of third parties."
"Investment 
properties also include right-of-use assets from rented, developed and 
undeveloped land (hereditary building rights) and from rented residential 
and commercial properties (interim leasing) within the meaning of IFRS 16 
that are classified as investment properties."
Investment properties are initially measured at cost.
"Related transaction 
costs, such as fees  for legal services or real estate transfer taxes, are 
included in the initial measurement."
"If properties are purchased as part of 
a business combination and if the transaction relates to a “business,” then 
IFRS 3 applies as far as recognition is concerned."
"Transaction costs are 
recognized as an expense."
"Following initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair 
value."
"Any change therein is recognized as affecting net income in the 
income statement."
"If, during the land or project development phase, reliable 
measurement at fair value is not possible due to the lack of marketability 
and the lack of comparable transactions, recognition is at acquisition cost."
"In such cases, the cost model is continued until a reliable measurement can 
be carried out, but at the latest until the property in question is completed."
"Investment properties are transferred to property, plant and equipment 
when there is a change in use evidenced by the commencement of owner-­
occupation."
"The properties’ deemed cost for subsequent measurement 
corresponds to the fair value at the date of reclassification."
"The values as of December 31, 2023, include assets of 
€ 304.1 million (December 31, 2022: € 663.7 million) that are 
measured at cost, as their fair value cannot be reliably 
calculated on a continuing basis."
"In the reporting period, a 
need for impairment identified as part of the ad hoc goodwill 
impairment test resulted in impairment losses of € 47.6 million 
being recognized on these project developments."
"These 
were reported under depreciation and amortization losses."
"The additions in the 2023 reporting year include € 291.2 mil-
lion (2022: € 572.4 million) in production costs for new 
construction activities."
"The total amount reported for investment properties as of 
December 31, 2023, includes right-of-use assets from recog-
nized hereditary building rights and interim leasing arrange-
ments in the amount of € 1,798.5 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 2,019.8 million)."
"In this respect, we also refer to chapter
 [E44] Leases."
"The majority of € 1,798.0 million is attributable to ­
right-of-use 
assets from hereditary building rights ­
(December 31, 2022: 
€ 2,016.8 million)."
"This includes ­
right-of-use assets amounting 
to € 124.1 million (December 31, 2022: € 97.3 million) relating to 
the Spree-Bellevue (Spree-Schlange) property in Berlin, which 
comprises the leasehold land and the rented properties."
"The properties have been leased from the fund company 
DB Immobilienfonds 11 Spree-Schlange von Quistorp KG 
until 2044."
"The lease agreement includes an obligation to pay 
compensation for loss of use as agreed by contract."
"At the 
end of 2028, each fund subscriber is entitled to return their 
share to the property fund at a fixed redemption price."
"If all of 
the fund investors make use of this option, ­
Vonovia is obliged 
to acquire the properties at a fixed purchase price after 
deduction of borrowings."
"If more than 75% of the shares 
are returned in this way, ­
Vonovia has a call option for the 
purchase of all fund shares."
"For the investment properties encumbered with land 
charges in favor of various lenders, see chapter
 [E41] 
Non-derivative Financial Liabilities."
"Directly Attributable Operating Expenses 
Rental income from investment properties amounted to 
€ 3,259.6 million during the fiscal year (2022: € 3,191.4 mil-
lion)."
"Operating expenses directly relating to these proper-
ties amounted to € 395.3 million during the fiscal year (2022: 
€ 415.5 million)."
"These include expenses for maintenance, 
ancillary costs that cannot be passed on to the tenants, 
personnel expenses from the caretaker and craftsmen’s 
organizations, and capitalized internal expenses from 
charges passed on from the internal craftsmen’s organiza-
tion."
"The capitalized internal expenses relate to the work 
performed by the Group’s own craftsmen’s organization and 
the management costs for major modernization projects."
"Long-term Leases
­
Vonovia as a lessor has concluded long-term leases on 
commercial properties."
These are non-cancelable leases.
"The minimum future lease receipts from these leases are 
due as follows:
in € million
Dec."
"Portfolio premiums and discounts, which can be observed 
when portfolios are sold in market transactions, were not included."
"Nor 
were time restrictions in the marketing of individual properties."
"­
Vonovia 
determines fair value in accordance with the requirements of IAS 40 in 
conjunction with IFRS 13."
"­
Vonovia, in principle, measures its portfolio on the basis of the discounted 
cash flow (DCF) method."
"Under the DCF methodology, the expected future 
income and costs of a property are forecast over a detailed period of ten 
years and discounted to the date of valuation as the net present value."
"Due to the particular market situation in Austria and in order to reflect the 
extensive Austrian rent restrictions, a sales scenario involving the recurring 
sales of apartments is assumed for a subportfolio."
"In order to present these 
sales in the correct accounting period, the detailed period for the Austrian 
DCF model has been extended to 100 years."
"The income in the DCF model mainly comprises expected rental income 
(current net rent excl."
"ancillary costs, current incl."
"rent in Sweden, market 
rents as well as their development) taking vacancy losses and also sales 
revenues for an Austrian subportfolio into account."
"In Sweden, rents and rent increases 
are ­
defined as part of negotiations with the Swedish tenants’ association 
(“Hyresgästföreningen”) and are reflected accordingly in the valuation 
model."
"The expected sales revenues in Austria are derived from historical 
sale prices as well as market data (e.g.,  WKÖ, EHL)."
"On the cost side, maintenance expenses and administrative costs are taken 
into account."
"In Germany, these are taken into account in accordance with 
the II."
"Berechnungsverordnung (BV) is the 
German Regulation on Calculations for Residential Buildings in accordance 
with the Second Housing Construction Law, which stipulates how economic 
viability calculations for homes are to be performed."
"These cost approach-
es are also transferred to the Austrian market."
"Further cost items are, for 
example, ground rents, non-allocable ancillary costs, rent losses and, in 
Austria, selling costs."
"In the Swedish valuation model, further expenses to 
be borne by the owner are also taken into account in the DCF model due to 
the inclusive rents that are a special feature of this market."
"All cost items 
are inflated in the reporting period."
"Modernization measures carried out in 
the housing stocks are factored in by decreasing the current maintenance 
expenses and adjusting market rents."
"On this basis, the forecast cash flows are calculated on an annual basis 
and discounted to the date of valuation as the net present value."
"Further-
more, the terminal value of the property at the end of the ten-year period is 
determined using the expected stabilized net operating income and again 
discounted to the date of valuation as the net present value."
"The discount 
rate applied reflects the market situation, location, type of property, special 
property features (e.g., hereditary building rights, rent restrictions), the 
yield expectations of a potential investor and the risk associated with the 
forecast future cash flows of the property."
"The present value calculated in 
this way is reconciled to the market value by deducting standard market 
transaction costs, such as real estate transfer taxes, agent and notary costs."
"As the detailed period in the Austrian DCF model has been extended to 
100 years in order to present the sales scenarios in the correct accounting 
period, no terminal value is applied here."
"The commercial properties in the portfolio are mainly small commercial 
units for the supply of the local residential environment."
"Different cost 
approaches are used to those for residential properties, and discount rates 
were adjusted to reflect the market specifics."
"The valuation is, in principle, performed on the basis of homogeneous 
valuation units."
"These meet the criteria of economically cohesive and 
­
comparable land and buildings."
"Project developments for 
subsequent management within its own portfolio are measured using the 
cost approach until the construction work is complete – subject to a review 
of the values applied if triggering events occur."
"Once the construction 
work is complete, measurement is at fair value using the DCF procedure 
described above."
"Existing areas with construction potential are valued using 
a comparable method on the basis of the local standard land value evalu-
ated."
"Deductions are taken into account in particular for the readiness for 
construction and potential use as well as for likelihood of development and 
the development situation."
"Inheritable building rights granted are valued 
in the same way as the property portfolio using a DCF method."
"The input 
parameters here are the duration and amount of ground rent and the value 
of the land."
"The right-of-use assets from leasehold contracts are recognized 
at their fair value."
"The fair value of the leasehold contracts corresponds to 
the present value of the standard market leasehold fee payments up until 
the end of the term of the hereditary building right in question."
"These are 
calculated based on the current amount of the ground rent."
"In order to 
­
calculate the present value, the leasehold fee payments are discounted 
using a property-specific interest rate."
"­
Vonovia determines the fair values of its real estate portfolio in Germany, 
Sweden and Austria in its in-house valuation department on the basis of 
the methodology described above."
"In addition to the internal valuation, ­
Vonovia’s real estate 
portfolio was also valued by the independent property 
appraisers CBRE GmbH, Jones Lang LaSalle SE and Savills 
Sweden AB."
"The market value resulting from the external 
report was consistent with the internal valuation result."
"The fair value for the nursing care properties was calculated 
by the independent expert W&P Immobilienberatung GmbH 
using a DCF method."
"The contractually fixed remuneration for the valuation report 
is not linked to the valuation results."
"The real estate portfolio of ­
Vonovia is to be found in the 
items investment properties, property, plant and equipment 
(owner-occupied properties), real estate inventories, con-
tract assets and assets held for sale."
"This corresponds to a net initial yield for the real estate 
portfolio of 2.8% (total portfolio including Sweden and 
Austria; December 31, 2022: 2.5%)."
"For Germany, this results 
in an in-place rent multiplier of 25.1 for the portfolio 
­
(December 31, 2022: 29.2) and a fair value per m² of € 2,297 
(December 31, 2022: € 2,590 per m²)."
"€ 4,135.4 million for development, undeveloped land, inheritable building rights granted and other; € 1,343.1 million of this amount relates to  
investment properties."
The investment properties balance sheet item also includes the present value in connection with payments for right-of-use assets in the amount of € 451.1 million.

"Sensitivity Analyses
The sensitivity analyses performed on ­
Vonovia’s real estate 
portfolio show the impact of value drivers dependent upon 
market developments."
"Those influenced in particular are 
the market rents and their development, the amount of 
recognized administrative and maintenance expenses, cost 
increases, the vacancy rate and interest rates."
"The effect of 
possible fluctuations in these parameters is shown ­
separately 
for each parameter according to regional market in the 
following."
"Interactions between the parameters are possible but 
cannot be quantified owing to the complexity of the interre-
lationships."
"The vacancy and market rent parameters, for 
example, can influence each other."
"If rising demand for 
housing is not met by adequate supply developments, then 
this can result in lower vacancy rates and, at the same time, 
rising market rents."
"If, however, the rising demand is com-
pensated for by a high vacancy reserve in the location in 
question, then the market rent level does not necessarily 
change."
"Changes in the demand for housing can also impact the risk 
associated with the expected cash flows, which is then 
reflected in adjusted discounting and capitalized interest 
rates."
"The effects do not, however, necessarily have to have 
a favorable impact on each other, for example, if the changes 
in the demand for residential real estate are overshadowed 
by macroeconomic developments."

them on to any future buyers."
"After a certain period of time,

"Under financing agreements, ­
Vonovia may be subject to

"In accordance with IFRS 9, the classification of financial assets takes into 
account both the business model in which financial assets are held and the 
characteristics of the cash flows of the assets in question."

Vonovia has exercised the irrevocable option to state future 
changes to the fair value in other comprehensive income in equity."
"Gains 
and losses recognized in other comprehensive income are never reclassified 
from total equity to the income statement on their disposal."
"The carrying amount of financial assets corresponds to 
maximum risk of loss as of the reporting date."
"The increase in financial assets is due primarily to the initial 
recognition of two new derivatives in the form of long-term 
options to buy back shares."
"The first call option arose in the 
amount of € 374.0 million in connection with the sale of 
shares in the ­
Südewo portfolio in the first half of 2023 and 
was adjusted to € 464.0 million, affecting net income, as of 
the reporting date."
"The second call option was added to this 
at the end of the year."
"It arose in the context of the sale of 
shares in the northern Germany portfolio and was recognized 
in the amount of € 374.0 million upon initial recognition."
"In a sensitivity analysis, the WACC, as the main influencing 
factor, was changed by +0.5%/-0.5% for the call options, 
which would result in a change in equity affecting net 
income of € -97.0 million/€ +114.0 million."
"In addition,

positive market values from interest rate derivatives in the 
amount of € 68.2 million (December 31, 2022: € 165.5 million) 
were reported under non-current derivatives."
"The loans to associates relate exclusively to loan receivables 
from the QUARTERBACK Immobilien Group that are 
­
recognized after taking account of an expected credit loss."
"The loans were granted in line with standard market condi-

"The change is due to loan repayments and, on the 
other hand, new loans taken out with a maturity of more

The maximum default risk on the receivables from the sale of properties is limited to the margin and the transaction unwinding costs as the title to the properties remains with Vonovia as secu-
rity until receipt of payment."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
205
Accounting Policies
Impairment losses on financial assets are determined based on the 
expected credit loss model."
"The guiding principle of the model is to reflect 
the general pattern of deterioration or improvement in the credit quality of 
financial instruments, taking losses that are already expected into account."
"The IFRS 9 approach includes the following measurement levels:
 
> Level 1: Twelve-month expected credit losses (ECLs), which applies to all 
items (from initial recognition) as long as there is no significant deteriora-
tion in credit quality."
"> Level 2: Lifetime ECLs (homogeneous debtor portfolios), which applies 
when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on an individual or a 
collective basis of financial instruments."
"> Level 3: Lifetime ECLs (based on an individual assessment): If an individual 
assessment of assets produces objective indications of a need for 
impairment, then an assessment of the entire maturity of the financial 
instrument is decisive."
"The simplified impairment approach is used with regard to trade receiv-
ables (e."
"g., rent receivables, receivables from ancillary costs, receivables 
from the sale of properties) and for contract assets pursuant to IFRS 15."
This means that there is no need to track the changes in credit risk.
"Instead, 
­
Vonovia has to set up loan loss provisions in the amount of the lifetime 
expected credit losses both at the time of initial recognition and on each 
following reporting date."
"The carrying amounts of current trade receivables corre-
spond to their fair values."
"In principle, all impaired trade receivables are due and 
payable."
"As regards the trade receivables that are neither 
impaired nor past due, there was no indication on the 
reporting date that the debtors would not meet their 
­
payment obligations."
"Receivables from the sale of properties arise on economic 
transfer of ownership."
"The due date of the receivable may, 
however, depend on the fulfillment of contractual obliga-
tions."
"Some purchase contracts provide for the purchase 
price to be deposited in an escrow account."
"Impairment 
losses for doubtful debts are recorded up to the amount of 
the posted proceeds from sales."
"­
Vonovia’s receivables from property letting generally arise at 
the beginning of the month, are of a short-term nature and 
result from claims in relation to tenants relating to operating 
business activities."
"Due to the (subsequent) measurement 
at amortized cost, an impairment test has to be performed."
"The receivables fall under the scope of the calculation of 
expected credit losses."
"In accordance with the general provisions set out in IFRS 9, 
expected credit losses are to be recognized using the simpli-
fied approach for current trade receivables without any 
significant financing component."
"­
Vonovia uses a credit loss matrix when calculating expected 
credit losses for trade receivables."
"The matrix is based on 
historical default rates and takes current expectations into 
account, including macroeconomic indicators ( e.g., GDP)."
"The matrix can be used to calculate the expected credit 
losses for various homogeneous portfolios."
"In order to create portfolios for the purpose of assessing the 
probability of default, the individual clusters of receivables 
need to have homogeneous credit risk characteristics."
"As far 
as receivables from its operating business activities are 
concerned, i.e., the letting of rental properties, ­
Vonovia 
makes a distinction between receivables from existing 
tenants and receivables from former tenants."
"Both portfolios 
include current receivables that are exposed to a low level of 
volatility, as the company’s core operating business is hardly 
exposed to any major fluctuations."
"Consolidated Financial Statements — Notes
206
Calculation Method for Receivables from Former Tenants
The calculation of the probability of default is based on the 
results of an analysis of the historical probability of default."
"Cash flows relating to outstanding receivables over the last 
three years have been analyzed and an average amount of 
incoming payments for the year in question was calculated 
on a monthly basis."
"The average monthly incoming pay-
ments were compared against the average monthly receiv-
ables for the year in question."
"Ultimately, ­
Vonovia has been 
able to collect approx."
"4.5% of the average receivables over 
the last three years."
"This means that ­
Vonovia sets up risk 
provisions corresponding to a rounded total of 95% for its 
receivables from former tenants."
"The loss given default comprises the following: 
The receivables of former tenants that are being analyzed 
(amount of the receivable at the time of default) are correct-
ed to reflect retained deposits that serve as security for 
­
Vonovia."
"This is already taken into account as part of the 
calculation method used for the probability of default."
"The average receivables taken as a basis do not include 
receivables subject to specific valuation allowances that 
were written off in full."
"Receivables from Existing Tenants
When it comes to determining the probability of default 
with regard to receivables associated with ongoing lease 
agreements, ­
Vonovia analyzes those receivables that have 
­
actually been derecognized over the last three years."
"This is performed systematically by way of a receivables 
management system according to the aspects receivables 
relating to ancillary expenses, those connected to the 
product, rent adjustments and payment difficulties."
"Impairment losses on trade receivables developed as

"In cases involving pay-

40% and 95% of the receivables and amounted to € 9.7 
million in total (December 31, 2022: € 18.2 million)."
"The risk provisions for former tenants correspond to 95% 
of the receivables and amount to € 32.1 million in total 
(December 31, 2022: € 31.5 million)."
"For contracts with customers who are assigned to ­
Vonovia’s 
development business, the payment terms pursuant to 
Section 3 (2) of the Real Estate Agent and Commercial 
Contractor Regulation (MaBV) generally apply in Germany."
"Customers also have a contractual obligation to present a 
financing commitment issued by a credit institution for the 
entire purchase price."
"Otherwise, ­
Vonovia is entitled to 
withdraw from the agreement."
"In Austria, the installment 
plan pursuant to Section 10 (2) of the Austrian Property 
Development Contract Act (BTVG) is normally applied, with 
customers obliged to pay the entire purchase price into an 
escrow account."
"Due to the structure of the standard 
payment terms in the development business, no separate 
impairment losses are taken into account on corresponding 
receivables from customer contracts."
"For example, receivables are derecognized if tenants die and 
have no heirs, if they move to an unknown location or move 
abroad, if execution is impossible for the court bailiff, in 
cases involving bankruptcy or if a settlement was reached."
"Cash and cash equivalents are measured using the general impairment 
approach in accordance with IFRS 9."
"Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, checks and 
deposits at banking institutions totaling € 1,374.4 million 
(December 31, 2022: € 1,101.8 million), as well as current 
securities in the previous year in the amount of € 200.6 million."
"€ 415.8 million (December 31, 2022: € 104.1 million) of the 
bank balances are restricted with regard to their use."
"36 Real Estate Inventories
Accounting Policies
Properties from the sales-related development business and land and 
buildings intended for sale are reported within real estate inventories."
"The 
sales-related development business refers to subsidized or independently 
financed condominiums that are under construction or have already been 
completed."
"These properties are not held with the aim of generating rental 
income or achieving increases in value within the meaning of IAS 40, but 
rather are developed and constructed to be sold at a later date."
"These devel-
opment projects are recognized depending on whether there is a customer 
contract for the residential units that are intended for sale."
"If this is not the 
case, the valuation is performed, due to the intention to sell according to 
IAS 2 at amortized cost or at net realizable value, whichever is lower, with a 
corresponding disclosure under real estate inventories."
"Recognized real estate inventories in the amount of 
€ 1,957.7 million (December 31, 2022: € 2,156.3 million) 
concern development projects."

struct residential units planned for sale that are currently 
being built or that have been completed but have not yet 
been sold."

Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations
Accounting Policies
Assets held for sale include those non-current assets that can, and are ex-
tremely likely to be, sold at standard conditions in their current state."
"This item not only includes individual non-current assets that are to be sold, 
but also groups of assets (disposal groups)."
"Discontinued operations are 
reported separately as an item in their own right."
"Initially they are recognized at the contractually agreed 
selling price and subsequently at fair value following deductions for costs to 
sell, if the latter is lower."
"A discontinued operation refers to a scenario in which a separate major line 
of business or a geographical area of operations is classed as held for sale, 
or if a business activity is part of a single coordinated plan for such a sale."
"A line of business has to be distinct from the other activities for accounting 
purposes before it can be classified as a discontinued operation."
"The result 
from the discontinued operations are presented separately from the con-
tinuing operations in the consolidated income statement."
"The comparative 
year is restated as if the discontinued operation had been classified as such 
from the start of that year."
"Assets Held for Sale
The assets held for sale include only properties for which 
notarized purchase contracts had already been signed as of 
the reporting date as part of ­
Vonovia’s ordinary sales activities 
totaling € 313.1 million."
"The value as of December 31, 2022, was 
€ 70.8 million."

Discontinued Operations
As part of the strategic review, the management decided to 
sell the Care segment."
"The sale process has begun and it is 
expected to have been concluded before December 2024."
"Accordingly, the majority of the Care segment is presented 
as discontinued operations."
"Impairment Losses on the Disposal Group
At present, the management expects the group to be sold at 
the relevant carrying amounts."
"As a result, the valuation of the disposal group at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell has not 
produced any valuation effects."
"As of December 31, 2023, the disposal group comprised the 
following assets and liabilities:
in € million

"2,949 were 
female as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: 2,934)

"The average 
figure for the year was 3,869 employees (2022: 3,801)."
"As of ­
December 31, 2023, ­
Vonovia had 385 apprentices

(December 31, 2022: 305) working in the business area 
belonging to the discontinued operations."
"€ 1.1 million of the gains and losses are attributable to 
­
Vonovia’s shareholders and € 0.2 million to non-controlling 
shareholders."
"Earnings per Share
The earnings per share attributable to the profit for the 
period of the discontinued operations came to € -0.16 (2022: 
€ -0.10) for the 2023 fiscal year."
"Due to the small amount of 
cumulative income and expenses included in other compre-
hensive income, this also matches the earnings per share for 
total comprehensive income."
"­
Vonovia includes under this item unrealized gains and losses from the fair 
value measurement of equity instruments and derivative financial instru-
ments that are designated as cash flow hedges."
"The item also includes actu-
arial gains and losses from defined benefit pension commitments as well as 
certain currency translation differences."
"The other reserves contain cumulative changes in equity not affecting in-
come."
"At ­
Vonovia, the effective portion of the net change in the fair value of 
cash flow hedging instruments, the equity instruments at fair value as well 
as currency translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive 
income."
"The other reserves from cash flow hedges and from currency translation 
differences can be reclassified."
"When the underlying hedged item of the 
cash flow hedge affects net income, the reserves attributable thereto are 
reclassified to profit or loss."
"If a foreign business is disposed of, the reserves 
attributable thereto are reclassified."

Dividend
The Annual General Meeting held on May 17, 2023, resolved 
to pay a dividend for the 2022 fiscal year in the amount of 
€ 0.85 per share, or € 676,472,497.45 in total."
"As in previous years, shareholders were offered the option of 
choosing between being paid the dividend in cash or being 
granted new shares."
"During the subscription period, share-
holders holding a total of 44.87% of the shares carrying 
dividend rights opted for the scrip dividend instead of the 
cash dividend."
"As a result, 18,795,001 new shares were 
issued using the company’s authorized capital pursuant to 
Section 5.1 of the Articles of Association (“2022 authorized 
capital”) at a subscription price of € 16.15, i.e., a total amount 
of € 303,539,266.15."

Retained earnings of € 19,751.0 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 25,605.1 million) were reported as of December 31, 2023."
"This figure includes actuarial gains and losses of € -3.4 mil-
lion (December 31, 2022: € 22.7 million), which cannot be 
reclassified and therefore may no longer be recognized in 
profit or loss in subsequent reporting periods."
"Other Reserves
Changes in other comprehensive income during the period 
in the amount of € -120.3 million (2022: € -359.8  million) are 
mainly the result of the development of cash flow hedges in 
the amount of € -93.0 million(2022: € 54.0 million)."
"Non-controlling Interests
Shares of third parties in Group companies are recognized 
under non-controlling interests."

increased the company’s retained earnings by € 226.4 million."
"A call option that ­
Vonovia can exercise to buy the shares 
back was agreed as part of the transaction."
"The initial 
measurement as of the transaction date produced a market 
value of € 374.0 million."

"­
Vonovia has taken 
out reinsurance contracts for individual people."
"Generally, they are pension benefits that depend on the final 
salary with percentage increases depending on the number 
of years of service."
"The pension commitments cover 6,524 (December 31, 2022: 
7,657) vested rights."
"The increase results mainly from 
first-time inclusion of the participants in the deferred 
compensation scheme that was newly agreed in 2021 in the 
pension valuation."
"The new “BAV 2021” deferred compensation scheme applies 
as standard for all defined employee groups within the 
­
Vonovia Group in Germany (current number of participants: 
1,482)."
"In addition to deferred compensation, the employer 
subsidies (matching contributions) are also contributed to 
the new employee retirement benefit plan."
"The matching 
contributions made in each case correspond to the amount 
of the deferred compensation contribution made, and are 
limited to 1% of the employee’s monthly gross basic salary."
"Executives currently working for companies belonging to 
­
Vonovia have the opportunity to participate in the “Pension 
Instead of Cash Remuneration” model (Versorgungsbezüge 
anstelle von Barbezügen) (eligible persons: 1,790, including 
persons no longer active)."
"Retirement, invalidity and surviv-
ing dependent benefits in the form of a lifelong pension are 
offered under this deferred compensation model."
"The 
retirement benefits can also be paid out as a one-time 
capital sum."

assets."
"Reinsurance policies have been taken out for former 
Management Board members against payment of a one-

"The weighted average term of the defined benefit obliga-
tions is 12.82 years (December 31, 2022: 12.5 years)."
"This percentage rise

a man who was 65 at the reporting date."
"If several assumptions are changed simultaneously, the

"The discount rate is a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments."
"Provisions for restructuring expenses are recognized when the Group has 
set up and communicated a detailed formal plan for restructuring and has 
no realistic possibility of withdrawing from these obligations."
"Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits 
from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting the obliga-
tions under the contract."
"The provision is stated at the lower of the present 
value of the fulfillment obligation and the cost of terminating the contract, 
i.e., a possible indemnity or fine for breach or non-fulfillment of contract."

In the 2023 fiscal year, the previous 5.1% non-controlling

increased to 10.1%."
"This sale of shares increased the put 
option reported by € 83.2 million."

amount of € -37.9 million results from adjustments to 
­
(reductions in) the current IFRS value of the put options."
"The distinction between operating and finance 
leases only remains in place for accounting as the lessor."
"All contracts that give the ­
Vonovia Group the right to control the use of an 
identified asset over a certain period of time in return for consideration are 
considered leases within the meaning of IFRS 16."
"For all lease contracts that meet the definition of leases according to 
IFRS 16, ­
Vonovia recognizes lease liabilities equal to the present value of 
the future lease payments, discounted using the term-specific incremental 
borrowing rate."
"Correspondingly, right-of-use assets are recognized in the 
amount of the lease liabilities, plus any advance payments or any initial 
direct costs."
The lease liabilities are adjusted in line with financial principles.
"They 
are increased by the periodic interest expenses and reduced by the lease 
payments made."
"The right-of-use assets are generally recognized at amortized cost, taking 
depreciation and impairments into account."
"Right-of-use assets that meet 
the definition of investment properties (IAS 40) are recognized at fair value 
in line with the recognition and measurement rules set out in IAS 40."
"Changes within the lease term or within the lease payments lead to a 
remeasurement of the present value and, as a result, to an adjustment of 
the lease liability and the right-of-use asset."
"Periods resulting from extension or termination options granted on a uni-
lateral basis are assessed on a lease-by-lease basis and are only taken into 
account if their use is sufficiently probable – for example, due to financial 
incentives."
"There is an accounting option available for short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets."
"­
Vonovia makes use of this option, meaning that such 
leases are not recognized."
"As far as rented IT equipment and metering 
technology is concerned, portfolios are set up for leases with similar terms 
and a single discount rate is applied to these portfolios."
"Under 
license agreements with public-sector institutions, ­
Vonovia 
is granted the right to use public properties as storage 
locations or parking spaces, to lay heating pipes or cables, or 
to construct playgrounds."
"Long-term leasehold contracts 
have the biggest impact on the company’s net assets, 
financial position and results of operations."
"These involve 
­
Vonovia leasing land for the rental of constructed residential 
and commercial properties."
"These contracts generally have a 
term of 99 years."

mainly from leasehold contracts (€ 1,798.0 million)."
"Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023

Development of Lease Liabilities
Dec."
"The year-on-year decrease in lease liabilities of € -9.3 million 
is mainly due to lower lease liabilities from heating supply

the 2023 reporting year."
"Totaling € 511.8 million, the majority of the lease liabilities 
recognized as of December 31, 2023 are due after more than 
five years."
"Of this amount, € 428.9 million is attributable to 
lease liabilities from leasehold contracts."

corresponding expenses, recognized in the 2023 fiscal year, 
amounted to € 0.9 million (2022: € 0.6 million)."
"Expenses 
relating to leases of low-value assets amounting to € 2.7 million

leased bicycles/e-bikes."
"Expenses totaling € 38.8 million 
were incurred in connection with variable lease payments in 
the 2023 fiscal year (2022: € 33.1 million), basically due to 
energy costs under heat supply contracts."
"Variable lease 
payments have not been included in the measurement of 
lease liabilities."
"Thus, the total cash outflow 
for leases in the reporting period amounted to € 101.2 million

"Total income from subleasing, mostly from subleasing of 
right-of-use assets in connection with rented residential,

Liabilities to Non-controlling Interests
Accounting Policies
Liabilities to non-controlling interests, which include obligations from the 
guaranteed dividend agreements, in particular, are stated at fair value when 
they are recognized for the first time."
"The fair value is, in principle, deter-
mined by the value of the respective company; if a contractually agreed 
minimum purchase price is higher than this amount, this purchase price is 
recognized."
"The liabilities to non-controlling interests relate especially to 
the obligations to pay several guaranteed dividends under 
valid profit-and-loss transfer agreements or co-investor 
agreements in an amount of € 198.4 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 235.9 million)."
"46 Financial Liabilities from Tenant Financing
Accounting Policies
Financial liabilities from tenant financing include tenant financing contribu-
tions."
"The financing contributions relate to the contributions collected from 
tenants in Austria for subsidized apartments."
"These are reimbursed upon 
the termination of the rental contract following the deduction of a depreci-
ation amount."
"The amount refunded can be collected again relating to new 
tenants."
"As these are generally rental contracts that can be terminated at 
any time, these liabilities are reported as current liabilities."
"Financial liabilities from tenant financing also include maintenance and im-
provement contributions deposited by tenants (EVB)."
"These contributions 
are paid by tenants in Austria to finance the costs associated with modern-
ization work."
"The payment depends on the age of the building and must be 
used up for modernization work within 20 years of their receipt."
"Otherwise, 
the contributions have to be refunded to the tenant."
First-time recognition is at fair value.
"Subsequent measurement is at amor-
tized cost."
"The financial liabilities from tenant financing as of the 
reporting date include € 112.1 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 111.9 million) in tenant financing contributions."

were not granted any loans or advances."
"49 Share-based Payments
Accounting Policies
The obligations arising from share-based payments are calculated using 
standard valuation methods based on option pricing models (Monte Carlo 
simulation)."
"Calculation of the fair value on the reporting date is based on 
various parameters for the Monte Carlo simulation (risk-free rate, annual-
ized volatilities, correlations)."
"The annualized volatility and the correlation 
are calculated based on historical volatility and historical correlation in the 
period matching the residual term based on daily returns."
"The risk-free rate 
is calculated using the interest rate structure curve based on the Svensson 
method."
"As the LTIP provides for the granting of a dividend equivalent, there 
is no need to include the dividend yield."
"Equity-settled share-based payments are recognized at the grant date at 
the fair value of the equity instruments vested by that date."
"The fair value of 
the obligation is therefore recognized as personnel expenses proportionally 
over the vesting period and is offset directly against the capital reserves."
"The cash-settled share-based payments are shown under other provisions 
and remeasured at fair value at each reporting date."
"The expenses are also 
recognized as personnel expenses over the vesting period (see
 [E39] 
Provisions)."
"As a result, this 
LTIP constitutes a cash-settled plan pursuant to IFRS 2; in 
turn, the payout claim can be lost entirely if the defined 
target achievement level has not been reached."
"The value of the total phantom stocks that had been granted

The following table shows the assets and liabilities that are 
recognized in the balance sheet at fair value and their 
classification according to the fair value hierarchy:
in € million
Dec."
"The material valuation 
parameters and valuation results can be found in chapter 
 [D28] 
Investment Properties."
"The investment properties classified as assets held for sale are recognized 
at the time of their transfer to assets held for sale at their new fair value, the 
agreed purchase price (Level 2)."
"Securities are generally measured using the quoted prices in active markets 
(Level 1)."
"All investments in equity instruments that do not relate to associates or 
call options to buy back shares (Level 3) are measured at fair value in other 
comprehensive income."
"The Group’s primary aim is to hold its investments 
in equity instruments in the long term for strategic purposes."
"Measurement 
is at Level 3, as the share price of the relevant investments and the partly 
underlying cash flows are not directly observable."
"They are measured either 
directly via the share price or using a discounted cash flow model."
"The fair value of the bonds listed on the market is calculated based on the 
market prices that apply on the reporting date (Level 1)."
"The fair value of the other non-derivative financial liabilities is calculat-
ed by means of a discounted cash flow (DCF) model."
"In addition to the 
tenor-specific EURIBOR/STIBOR rates (3M; 6M), ­
Vonovia’s own credit risk 
is also used here (Level 2)."
"For the measurement of derivative financial instruments, cash flows are 
first calculated and then discounted."
"In addition to the tenor-specific 
EURIBOR/STIBOR rates (3M; 6M), the respective credit risk is taken as 
a basis for discounting."
"Depending on the expected cash flows, either 
­
Vonovia’s own credit risk or the counterparty risk is taken into account in 
the calculation."
"As part of the valuation of the cross currency swaps, the USD cash flows 
were converted into EUR using the EUR/USD FX forward curve, after which 
all EUR cash flows are discounted using the 6M EURIBOR curve (Level 2)."
"The amount of the estimated impairment loss on cash and cash equiva-
lents was calculated based on the losses expected over a period of twelve 
months."
"No financial instruments were reclassified to different 
hierarchy levels vis-à-vis the comparative period."
"Due to the current interest rate environment (and the return 
to more positive market values as a result), counterparty risk 
premiums were relevant for the interest rate swaps in the 
consolidated financial statements alongside ­
Vonovia’s own 
credit risk."
"As with ­
Vonovia’s own risk, they are derived from 
rates observable on the capital markets and ranged from 10 
to 160 basis points, depending on the residual maturities."
"­
Vonovia’s own risk premiums were trading at between 70 
and 190 basis points on the same cut-off date, depending on 
the maturities."
"The fair values of the cash and cash equivalents, trade 
receivables and other financial receivables approximate their 
carrying amounts at the reporting date owing to their mainly 
short maturities."
"It was determined that the cash and cash 
equivalents have a low risk of default due to the external 
ratings and short residual maturities and that there is no 
need for any material impairment of cash and cash 
­
equivalents."
"In accordance 
with IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows), a distinction is made between chang-
es in cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing 
activities."
The effects of changes in the scope of consolidation are shown separately.
"Therefore, direct comparison with the corresponding changes in the items 
of the consolidated balance sheet is not possible."
"The proceeds from the 
disposal of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment 
properties are shown in cash flow from investing activities."
"Exercising the IAS 7 option, interest received is shown under cash flow 
from investing activities and interest paid is shown under cash flow from 
financing activities."
"The item “Payments for acquisition of investment proper-
ties” mainly shows expenses for modernization measures."
"55 Financial Risk Management
In the course of its business activities, ­
Vonovia is exposed to 
various financial risks."
"The Group-wide financial risk man-
agement system aims to identify any potentially negative 
impact on the financial position of the Group early on and 
take suitable measures to limit this impact."
"For the structure 
and organization of financial risk management, we refer to 
the management report (see  Risk Management Structure and 
Instruments)."
"This system was implemented on the basis of 
Group guidelines, which were approved by the Management 
Board and which are continually reviewed."
"Nevertheless, currency fluctua-
tions are expected to result from financing relationships."
"By 
way of example, ­
Vonovia SE issued two bonds denominated 
in Swedish krona in a total amount of SEK 1,245.4 million 
in 2022."
"Based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2023, 
a -5% change in the value of the Swedish krona against the 
euro would result in currency gains of € 5.9 million, while a 
change of +5% would result in a currency loss of € 5.3 million."
"­
Vonovia is subject to no further material currency risks in 
the scope of its usual business activities."
"Interest Rate Risks
The investments measured at fair value are subject, in 
particular, to a price risk resulting from fluctuations in 
expected returns, market interest rates and expectations 
based on the operating business development of the invest-
ments."
"Other investments are long-term investments that 
are closely related to ­
Vonovia’s operating business areas."
"As a result, short-term realization of the price fluctuations 
cannot generally be assumed."
"In the course of its business activities, ­
Vonovia is exposed to 
cash-effective interest rate risks as a result of floating-rate 
debt as well as new and follow-on loans."
"Within this context, 
the interest markets are continually monitored by the 
Finance and Treasury department."
"Its observations are 
incorporated into the financing strategy."
"As part of its financing strategy, ­
Vonovia uses derivative 
financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and 
caps, to limit or manage interest rate risks."
"­
Vonovia’s poli-
cies permit the use of derivatives only if they are associated 
with underlying assets or liabilities, contractual rights or 
obligations and planned, highly probable transactions."
"A sensitivity analysis for cash flow hedges is provided 
under chapter
 [G57] Cash Flow Hedges and Stand-alone Hedging 
Instruments."
"Other Risks
­
Vonovia also acts as an energy supply company through its 
subsidiary ­
Vonovia Energie Service GmbH."
"Contracts used 
for procurement and in the context of sales do not constitute 
financial instruments under IFRS 9 as a general rule due to 
the own use exemption."
"However, because the contracts 
used are managed in a comparable manner, this business 
area is also presented below."
"Due in particular to the current 
fluctuations in energy procurement conditions, there is a risk 
that planned energy procurement prices may not be real-
ized."
"This indirectly results in the risk of the energy sales 
business becoming loss-making."
"­
Vonovia hedges against 
these risks with a broad range of risk management instru-
ments, which, in addition to a structured multi-year procure-
ment strategy and systematic risk monitoring, also offers the 
option of price adjustments during the year."
"This has signifi-
cantly reduced market price risks in the current dynamic 
situation on the energy procurement markets."
"For all material equity instruments categorized at FVOCI, a 
5% increase (reduction) in the share price would have 
increased (reduced) total equity by € 14.1 million (€ -14.1 mil-
lion) (December 31, 2022: € 19.5 million (€ -19.5 million)."
"With 
regard to the impact of the change in equity instruments at 
fair value in other comprehensive income during the report-
ing period, we refer to the statement of comprehensive 
income."
"Credit Risks
­
Vonovia is exposed to a default risk resulting from the 
potential failure of a counterparty to fulfill its part of the 
contract."
"In order to minimize risks, financial transactions 
are generally only executed with banks and partners whose 
credit rating has been found by a rating agency to be at least 
equivalent to ­
Vonovia’s."
"These counterparties are assigned 
volume limits set by the Management Board."
"The counter-
party risks are managed and monitored centrally by the 
Corporate Finance and Treasury department."
"Liquidity Risks
The companies of ­
Vonovia are financed by borrowings to a 
notable degree."
"Due to their high volume, the loans are in 
some cases exposed to a considerable refinancing risk."
"The 
liquidity risks arising from financing transactions with high 
volumes (volume risks) have become apparent in the 
financial sector, especially in the wake of the financial crisis."
"In order to limit these risks, ­
Vonovia is in constant contact 
with many different market players, continuously monitors 
all financing options available on the capital and banking 
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
239
markets and uses these options in a targeted manner."
"Moreover, ­
Vonovia subjects its existing financings to an 
early review prior to the respective final maturity date in 
order to ensure refinancing."
"Under the conditions of existing loan agreements, ­
Vonovia is 
obliged to fulfill certain financial covenants such as the debt 
service coverage ratio or debt-equity ratio."
"If financial 
covenants are violated, the breach is not rectified within 
so-called cure periods and no mutually acceptable agree-
ment can be reached with the lenders, the financing may be 
restructured and the cost structure changed."
"Should all 
commonly practiced solutions be unsuccessful, the lenders 
could call in the loan."
"The fulfillment of these financial 
covenants is continually monitored by the Corporate Finance 
and Treasury department on the basis of current actual 
figures and budgetary accounting."
"In order to ensure its ability to pay at all times, ­
Vonovia has 
put a system-supported cash management system in place."
"This system monitors and optimizes ­
Vonovia’s cash flows on 
an ongoing basis and provides the Management Board with 
regular reports on the Group’s current liquidity situation."
"Liquidity management is supplemented by short-term 
rolling, monthly liquidity planning for the current fiscal year, 
of which the Management Board is also promptly notified."
"In order to minimize credit risks, large amounts of cash on 
hand are avoided wherever possible."
"In the event that large 
reserves are necessary on a short-term basis due to pending 
investments or refinancing, these are distributed among 
various instruments and banking partners with good credit 
ratings."
"The following table shows the forecast for undiscounted 
cash flows of the non-derivative financial liabilities and 
derivative financial instruments for the 2023 reporting year."
"The loan repayments shown for the following years contain 
only contractually fixed minimum repayment amounts:

of December 31, 2023, the total volume of these loan frame-
work agreements stood at € 959.0 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 926.0 million), with € 678.0 million (December 31, 2022: 
€ 835.0 million) drawn."
"Since November 2021, an agreement has been in place 
between ­
Vonovia SE and a banking consortium led by 
Commerzbank AG for a syndicated credit facility with a 
volume of € 3,000.0 million."
"Drawdowns can be made in 
euros or Swedish krona under the agreement, which origi-
nally ended in 2024, with interest based on the EURIBOR or 
STIBOR, plus an additional margin."
"This credit line had not 
been used as of December 31, 2023."
"As a contractual exten-
sion option was exercised at the end of September, the 
agreement will end in 2026."
"A commercial paper master program with a total volume of 
€ 3,000.0 million, in which ­
Vonovia SE acts as the issuer, has 
also been in place since November 2021."
"Issues in an amount 
of € 500.0 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2023."
"In September, a general loan agreement for around 
€ 600.0 million was concluded between ­
Vonovia SE and a 
consortium of four banks led by Unicredit Bank AG."
"It can be 
used exclusively to refinance liabilities and any drawdowns 
must be repaid using the proceeds subsequently received

"This agreement 
will end after a two-year term."
"As of December 31, 2023, the total volume available under 
guarantee loan agreements in the Group as a whole amount-
ed to € 245.0 million."
"A total of € 117.2 million of this amount 
had been drawn down by the reporting date."
"The master credit 
agreements/the commercial paper program, together with 
the cash on hand, guarantee ­
Vonovia’s ability to pay at all

"56 Capital Management
­
Vonovia’s management aims to achieve a long-term increase 
in value in the interests of customers, employees and 
investors."
"Within this context, maintaining a degree of 
financial flexibility in order to be able to achieve strategic 
objectives is crucial."
"This is why ­
Vonovia’s capital manage-
ment focuses on ensuring our investment grade rating."
"The 
priority is to ensure sufficient liquidity resources and main-
tain an efficient ratio between secured and non-secured 
capital components."
"As part of the opportunities and risk management of 
­
Vonovia, the members of the Management Board are given 
monthly reports on the development of results and their 
potential effects on the capital structure."
The equity situation of the subsidiaries is regularly examined.

Cash Flow Hedges and Stand-alone Hedging Instru-
ments
On the reporting date, the nominal volume of cash flow 
hedges held in euros, including pre-hedges, amounts to 
€ 1,165.0 million (December 31, 2022: € 1,501.7 million)."
"Interest rates on hedging instruments are between 1.505% 
and 3.513% with original swap periods of between 
3.5 and 20 years."
"In order to manage its interest rate risk, ­
Vonovia concluded 
five float-to-fix interest rate swaps in the period between 
June 30, 2023 and July 6, 2023."
"These were supplemented 
by a forward starting interest rate swap concluded on 
July 5, 2023."
"All of the transactions concluded by ­
Vonovia SE 
were included in a hedge, while two interest rate swaps 
concluded by ­
Deutsche ­
Wohnen SE remain stand-alone 
interest rate swaps."
"The float-to-fix interest rate swaps will 
run for between 3.5 years and 6.25 years, hedge a total 
­
nominal amount of € 775 million and took effect between 
Consolidated Financial Statements — Notes
242
July 4, 2023 and July 10, 2023."
"The forward swap, with a 
nominal value of € 500 million and a term of ten years, will 
take effect on April 16, 2024; cash settlement was agreed."
"The new interest rate hedges exchange a 3M or 6M EURI-
BOR for a fixed interest rate of between 2.989% and 3.513%."
"All of the zero-cost swaption collars discussed at this point 
in the report in the previous year were settled in cash in the 
reporting year."
"For the hedging instruments that are maintained through 
passive hedge accounting, € 6.6 million was reclassified 
affecting net income in the reporting year in line with the 
expected cash flows from the underlying hedged items."
"This reduced the value recognized in other comprehensive 
income to € 4.2 million."
"All derivatives are included in netting agreements with the 
issuing banks."
"With the exception of one transaction, the euro interest rate 
swaps are reported with negative market values as of the 
reporting date."
"No economic or accounting offsetting was performed in the 
reporting year."

"In accordance with

"In all

"Our audit opinion on the group management report does

ment report listed in the “Other Information” section of 
our auditor’s report."
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare 
that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the 
legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements 
and of the group management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and of the group management report in accor-
dance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation 
(No."
"537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit 
­
Regulation”) in compliance with German Generally Accept-
ed Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated 
by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public 
Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"We performed the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements in supplementary compli-
ance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles 
and standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Re-
sponsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and of the Group Management Report“ section 
of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group 
entities in accordance with the requirements of European 
law and German commercial and professional law, and we 
have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in 
accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit 
Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit 
services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit 
Regulation."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements 
and on the group management report."
"These matters were ad-
dressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit 
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion 
on these matters."
"­
Vonovia SE exercises the 
option set out in IAS 40.30 of accounting for investment 
properties amounting to EUR 80,816.2 million using the fair 
value model in accordance with IFRS 13."
"Accordingly, chang-
es in market value realized when properties are sold, as well 
as unrealized changes in market value, are recognized at fair 
value through profit or loss."
"In the past financial year, impair-
ment losses of EUR 10,844.2 million in unrealized changes in 
market value were recognized through profit or loss in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income."
"When determining the fair value of investment property, it is 
assumed that the current use corresponds to the highest 
and best use of the property."
"Fair values are determined 
using a measurement model developed internally by the 
Company which uses the discounted cash flow method."
"A market value is determined 
for properties with no positive net cash inflows (usually 
vacant buildings) using a liquidation valuation method."
"Undeveloped land is usually measured based on an indirect 
comparison of indicative land values."
"To the extent possible, the Company uses data directly 
observable on the market to determine fair value (sources 
include property market reports prepared by expert commit-
tees and public and subscriptions-based market databases)."
"In addition, a valuation report for the entire portfolio is 
prepared by independent appraisers and is used to verify the 
plausibility of internal calculations."
"The fair value of the care homes is determined based on 
valuation reports prepared by an external appraiser."
"This 
appraiser determines the fair value analogously using the 
discounted cash flow method as well as, to the extent 
possible, information that is observable on the market."
"The measurement of investment properties is based on a 
large number of relevant parameters which are normally 
subject in some respects to uncertainties with regard to 
estimates and judgments by the executive directors."
"Even 
small changes in the measurement parameters can result in 
material changes in fair value."
"Against this background, this 
matter was of particular significance in the context of our 
audit."
"As part of our audit, with the collaboration of our specialists 
for process audits we recorded the internal controls in place 
relating to the measurement of investment property and 
assessed their appropriateness and effectiveness, among 
other things."
"We also carried 
out analytical audit procedures and tests of details with 
respect to the material parameters having an influence on 
value."
"Furthermore, we checked the results at the portfolio 
level by comparing them against our expectations as regards 
changes in value."
"Information — Independent Auditor’s Report
272
As part of our audit, we furthermore prepared a property-­
specific comparison calculation on a test basis using the 
discounted cash flow method and conducted inspections of 
selected properties."
"With regard to the care homes, we furthermore assessed the 
valuation reports obtained and the professional qualifica-
tions of the external experts and the calculation of fair value."
"We also assessed the respective valuation technique applied 
and the valuation parameters used."
"The valuation technique applied by the executive directors 
of the Company is appropriately designed as a whole and 
suitable in general the measurement of investment property."
"The Company’s disclosures relating to investment property 
are contained in section D28 of the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"Inventories comprise 
properties in connection with the sales-related project 
development business."
"Properties in development or under construction are classi-
fied as investment property in accordance with IAS 40 if 
they are intended to be used as a financial investment upon 
completion, and are initially recognized at cost."
"The fair 
value model is generally applied for the purposes of subse-
quent measurement, provided a reliable fair value can be 
determined for the properties."
"Due to the inherent risks that 
exist during the construction phase, development projects 
are generally carried at cost (cost model) until completion."
"The recoverability of development projects is generally 
assessed in accordance with the value in use concept."
"The 
option also provided for in accordance with IAS 36 to use fair 
value less costs to sell is not considered due to the uncer-
tainty in relation to fair value."
"Upon completion of the 
construction phase, the property is initially recognized in 
accordance with the fair value model."
"Undeveloped land is usually 
measured based on an indirect comparison of indicative land 
values."
"The measurement of properties in development and under 
construction is based on a large number of relevant parame-
ters that are generally subject to specific uncertainties with 
regard to estimates and judgments."
"Significant measure-
ment parameters include in particular the planned costs yet 
to be incurred as well as for the purposes of determining the 
net realizable values and/or values in use the expected cash 
flows as well as discount and capitalization rate."
"Even small 
changes in the measurement parameters can result in 
material changes in the net disposal proceeds and/or the 
value in use."
"As part of our audit, in collaboration with specialists for  
process audits, we recorded the internal controls in place 
and assessed their appropriateness and effectiveness, 
among other things."
"We also carried out analytical audit proce-
dures and tests of details with respect to the material 
parameters having an influence on value."
"We also analyzed 
the assumed production costs for various cost groups and 
compared these against external benchmarks."
"Furthermore, 
 Vonovia SE Annual Report 2023
273
we conducted inspections of a selected sampling of devel-
opment projects."
"During those visits, we noted the location 
and surroundings, including access, infrastructure, etc., in 
order to categorize the project."
"We also obtained an impres-
sion of the existence of the project and the current state of 
the buildings."
"For the purposes of assessing their plausibility, 
we compared the actual costs submitted and reviewed to 
the planned total investment costs."
"For larger projects, 
which are broken down into different construction areas and 
phases, the inspection served to better delimit and validate 
the calculation data."
"Impressions of quality (floors, tiles, 
sanitary facilities, outdoor facilities, etc.) were also possible, 
particularly in instances where construction work was at an 
advanced stage."
"In addition, the projects in the sampling 
were presented by the respective project managers at 
various meetings and key issues (schedule, construction 
status, award status of costs, changes to plans, leasing and 
sales status, etc.) were discussed with us."
"The valuation technique applied by the executive directors 
of the Company is appropriately designed as a whole and 
suitable in general for accounting in accordance with IAS 40 
and IAS 2."
"The Company’s disclosures related to property in develop-
ment or under construction reported as investment property 
are contained in section D28 of the notes to the consolidat-
ed financial statements and  to inventories in section D36 of 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Recoverability of goodwill
In the Company’s consolidated financial statements goodwill 
amounting in total to EUR 1,392 million is reported under the 
“Intangible assets” balance sheet item."
"Goodwill is tested for 
impairment by the Company once a year or when there are 
indications of impairment to determine any possible need 
for write-downs."
"The impairment test is carried out at the 
level of the groups of cash-generating units to which the 
relevant goodwill is allocated."
"The carrying amount of the 
relevant cash-generating units, including goodwill, is com-
pared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the 
context of the impairment test."
"The recoverable amount is 
generally determined using the value in use."
"The present 
value of the future cash flows from the respective group of 
cash-generating units normally serves as the basis of 
valuation."
"Present values are calculated using discounted 
cash flow models."
"For this purpose, the adopted medium-­
term business plan of the Group forms the starting point 
which is extrapolated based on assumptions about long-
term rates of growth."
"Expectations relating to future market 
developments and assumptions about the development of 
macroeconomic factors are also taken into account."
"The 
discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for 
the respective group of cash-generating units."
"If the need to 
recognize a write-down is identified based on the value in 
use, it is analyzed whether the use of fair value less costs of 
disposal would result in a higher recoverable amount."
"The 
annual impairment test determined that no need to recog-
nize a write-down."
"The impairment test triggered as of 
June 30, 2023 resulted in write-downs totaling EUR 138 
million in respect of the groups of cash-generating units in 
the segment Development."
"Against this background and due 
to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of 
particular significance in the context of our audit."
"As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology used for 
the purposes of performing the impairment test, among 
other things."
"After matching the future cash flows used for 
the calculation against the adopted medium-term business 
plan of the Group, we assessed the appropriateness of the 
calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and 
sector-specific market expectations."
"In addition, we as-
sessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group 
functions."
"In the knowledge that even relatively small 
changes in the discount rate applied can have a material 
impact on the value in use calculated in this way, we focused 
our testing in particular on the parameters used to deter-
mine the discount rate applied, and assessed the calculation 
model."
"In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the 
projections, we reproduced the sensitivity analyses per-
formed by the Company."
"The valuation parameters and assumptions used by the 
executive directors are within the ranges considered by us to 
be reasonable."
"The Company’s disclosures relating to the “Intangible 
assets” balance sheet item and the impairment test are 
contained in section D 26 “Intangible assets” of the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements."

"We exercise professional judgment and maintain profession-
al skepticism throughout the audit."

the Non-financial Group Statement."
"This responsibility includes the selection and application of 
appropriate non-financial reporting methods and making 
assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial

"Furthermore, the executive directors are responsi-

clarifications have not yet been published in every case."
"Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their 
interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the

"The 
eponymous European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) 
is a non-profit organization that has its registered headquar-
ters in Brussels and represents the interests of listed Europe-
an real estate companies."
"Its mission is to raise awareness of 
European listed real estate companies as a potential invest-
ment destination that offers an alternative to conventional 
investments."
"In order to make it easier to compare real estate companies 
and to reflect special features that apply to the real estate 
sector, EPRA has developed a framework for standardized 
reporting that goes beyond the scope of the IFRS."
"­
Vonovia reports the EPRA key figures based on the EPRA 
Best Practice Recommendations (BPRs)."
"­
Vonovia only uses 
some of the EPRA key figures as performance indicators, 
which is why they are reported outside of the management 
report."
"They are non-GAAP measures or also APMs (alter-
native performance measures)."
"We would like to point out that the EPRA BPRs refer general-
ly to both residential and commercial real estate companies."
"On the other hand, ­
Vonovia is active almost exclusively in 
the area of housing."
"­
Vonovia’s business model is based on 
the development and construction of new apartments, both 
for its own portfolio and for sale to third parties, the letting 
of homes, the provision of housing-related services and the 
sale of apartments."
"Unlike companies with a commercial 
real estate portfolio and, as a result, a relatively small 
number of properties, ­
Vonovia’s portfolio features a large 
number of fairly similar residential units."
"This means that it 
does not make sense for a company specializing in residen-
tial real estate to report much of the information recom-
mended in the EPRA BPRs, which focus in particular on 
significant individual properties."
"The Development segment relates almost exclusively to 
residential units."

as clear as possible on the fair value of a real estate compa-
ny’s assets and liabilities in various scenarios."
"The EPRA Net Reinstatement Value (NRV) is calculated 
based on the assumption that properties are never sold."
"It 
represents the asset value that would be required to rebuild 
the company from scratch."
"The equity attributable to 
­
Vonovia’s shareholders is adjusted by the deferred taxes in 
relation to fair value gains of investment properties and the 
fair value of derivative financial instruments after taking 
deferred taxes into account."
"In addition, the real estate 
transfer tax and other purchasers’ costs, deducted as part of 
the property valuation process, are added back."
"No fair value 
is recognized for intangible assets."
"As a result, the NRV does 
not include any additional value contribution, not recognized 
in the balance sheet, from the Development and Value-add 
platform."
"The EPRA NTA (Net Tangible Assets) is calculated based on 
the assumption that properties are purchased and sold."
"This 
means that part of the deferred taxes on real estate assets is 
inevitably realized as a result of the sale process."
"At ­
Vonovia, 
the Recurring Sales, Non Core and MFH Sales portfolio 
clusters, as well as the portfolio in Austria, are not to be 
allocated to the real estate portfolio that is held in the long 
term."
"The deferred taxes on these portfolios are calculated 
in proportion to the fair values and reduce the total deferred 
taxes recognized."
"The pro rata real estate transfer tax and 
other purchasers’ costs for the portfolio held in the long 
term are not reported."
"The fair value of derivative financial 
instruments, after taking deferred taxes into account, is 
adjusted and the intangible assets (goodwill and other intan-
gible assets) are eliminated in full."
"The EPRA Net Disposal Value (NDV) determines the value 
of the equity in a sale scenario."
"The fair values of the de-
ferred taxes and financing instruments are realized as in IFRS

Adjusted EBT is the Group’s leading indicator of profitability 
as of 2024."
"The IFRS profit for the period is reconciled to 
earnings before taxes (EBT)."
"This EBT is adjusted to reflect 
special effects based on the definition that has applied to 
date (effects that do not relate to the period, recur irregular-
ly or are atypical for business operations)."
"The net financial 
result is also adjusted to reflect non-cash and actuarial 
valuation effects that recur irregularly."
"The further adjust-
ments to reflect the effects of IAS 40 measurement, write-
downs, other (Non Core/Other result), net income from 
non-current financial assets accounted for using the equity 
method and effects from residential properties held for sale 
produce the Group’s Adjusted EBT."
"Adjusted EBITDA Development
The Adjusted EBITDA Development includes the gross profit 
from the development activities of “to sell” projects (income 
from sold development projects, rental income less produc-
tion costs), less the operating expenses from the Develop-
ment segment."
"Adjusted EBITDA Recurring Sales
Adjusted EBITDA Recurring Sales compares the proceeds 
generated from the privatization business with the fair 
values of assets sold and also deducts the related costs of 
sale."
"In order to disclose profit and revenue in the period in 
which they are incurred and to report a sales margin, the fair 
value of properties sold, valued in accordance with IFRS 5, 
has to be adjusted to reflect realized/unrealized changes in 
value."
"Adjusted EBITDA Rental
The Adjusted EBITDA Rental is calculated by deducting the 
operating expenses of the Rental segment and the expenses 
for maintenance in the Rental segment from the Group’s 
rental income."
"The Adjusted EBITDA Total is derived from the sum of the 
Adjusted EBITDA Rental, Adjusted EBITDA Value-add, 
Adjusted EBITDA Recurring Sales and Adjusted EBITDA 
Development."
"Adjusted EBITDA Value-add
The Adjusted EBITDA Value-add is calculated by deducting 
operating expenses from the segment’s income."
"COSO
The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread-
way Commission (COSO) is a private-sector U.S."

"This provided a basis for the documentation, 
analysis and design of internal control systems."
