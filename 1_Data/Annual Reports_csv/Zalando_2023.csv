"Dear shareholders,
We are pleased to share with you Zalando’s progress, insights, and strategic outlook."
"In 2023, 
Zalando focused on profitable growth in light of a challenging year for online fashion."
"In this 
year of transition we laid further foundations for growth, delivering on strategic initiatives to 
better serve our customers."
"Firstly, we doubled down on elevating the core fashion and lifestyle shopping experience."
"We 
invested in technology to solve problems such as helping customers find fashion that fits right 
away, leading to fewer returns."
"We brought exciting brands on board such as lululemon and 
HOKA as well as deepening and expanding partnerships, for example with luxury perfumes 
and cosmetics houses Lancôme, Shiseido and Mugler."
"Serving customers across 25 very 
different markets requires country-specific knowledge and a tailored approach."
"We are 
increasingly taking a localized approach, working with local brands and designers and adding 
even more country-specific delivery and payment options."
"Secondly, we invested in ways to increase engagement with our customers."
"The shift from 
transactional shopping towards purchases inspired by stories, experiences or community is 
gaining momentum."
"In September we launched ‘Stories on Zalando’, a new immersive visual-
first fashion experience."
"Another engagement tool is our new fashion assistant powered by

generative artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT."
"The technology allows customers to ask 
questions using their own fashion terms and words, helping them navigate Zalando’s large 
assortment in a more intuitive way."
"Thirdly, we invested in our B2B offerings to better serve our business customers."
"We launched 
our new ZEOS brand, short for Zalando E-commerce Operating System, building an operating 
system for the fashion and lifestyle industry that enables brands and retailers to manage their 
multi-channel business across Europe within one unified platform."
"These accomplishments underscore our commitment to innovation and our ability to adapt to 
the evolving needs of our customers."
"At the heart of our success is our unwavering 
commitment to delivering an outstanding customer experience."
"We drove these strategic initiatives in a year that was marked by high inflation and low 
consumer sentiment."
"In this challenging economic environment, we made a deliberate decision 
not to chase growth at any cost and instead focused on balancing growth with profitability."
"Gross Merchandise Volume was EUR 14.6bn and operating profit, adjusted earnings before 
interest and tax came in at EUR 349.9m in 2023."
We remain dedicated to sustainability.
"We brought together the teams working on our 
Sustainability and D&I strategies under one strategic umbrella as part of Corporate 
Development."
"This ensures a stronger and more holistic approach to achieving our goals and 
commitments in areas that are pivotal for transforming both Zalando and the wider fashion 
industry."
Zalando expanded its FASHION LEAP FOR CLIMATE initiative.
"The second year of this unique 
collaboration with ABOUT YOU and YOOX NET-A-PORTER saw the three leading online 
retailers enhancing their co-created climate learning platform."
"Since launching the initiative, 
129 brands have joined the initiative."
"The platform supports fashion brands to measure their 
own carbon footprint and sets targets that align with climate science."
"As part of our commitment to providing a more inclusive assortment, we designed new private 
label collections for Adaptive Fashion."
"We incorporated feedback from customers with 
disabilities to improve the functionality features of our products via collaborations with the 
consultancy All is for All and prosthetics and wheelchair manufacturer Ottobock."
"We then 
expanded our collections to more than 430 items from Private Labels, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike 
and the latest addition Friendly Shoes."
"Another initiative to achieve this goal is our dedicated 
approach to onboard more Black-owned brands."
"In 2023 we onboarded seven new brands, 
including Ahluwalia and Yaura, bringing the total number of Black-owned brands to 70."
"Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, we are embarking on a new phase where the industry is 
undergoing significant change, presenting us with tremendous growth opportunities and the 
chance once again to shape the industry’s future."

Our vision is to build an ecosystem of fashion and lifestyle e-commerce - on Zalando and 
beyond."
"We have defined strategies for both our fashion and lifestyle business (B2C) and our 
infrastructure business (B2B) that build on existing strengths and will enable Zalando to drive 
innovation and positively shape the industry as a whole."
"For our B2C business, we will improve the core shopping experience, further differentiating 
ourselves through quality by offering our customers high value experiences and services."
"The 
key to success lies in strong loyalty and retention and we will do this by increasing customer 
engagement."
"Our goal is to become a lifestyle destination that caters to our customers’ 
multiple lifestyle needs and choices."
"Our understanding of the European market with its local 
preferences and nuances will help us develop stronger customer relationships."
"By leveraging 
technology and data, we can address shopping challenges on a larger scale."
"We strive to make 
the discovery of fashion and lifestyle products a fun and entertaining experience, encouraging 
customers to visit us more often and spend more quality time with us."
"Bridging the worlds of 
entertainment and e-commerce means offering a more conversational, playful, participatory 
and social experience."
"Our engagement journey builds on our existing efforts to inspire 
customers, exemplified by ‘Stories on Zalando’."
"For our B2B business, we are expanding our offerings for business customers, leveraging our 
unique technology and infrastructure capabilities, as well as strong existing brand-partner 
relationships."
"We started with logistics through our ZEOS Fulfillment offering and will grow this 
offering."
"Furthermore, we see great potential in providing merchants with software and 
services to sell fashion and lifestyle products across Europe."
"These strategies show our commitment to pursuing initiatives that will drive growth, 
profitability and shareholder value in the long term."
"We’d like to thank our entire Zalando team for their hard work in driving the company forward 
this year."
"Their passion, drive and determination make Zalando unique and are decisive 
success factors."
"In conclusion, we thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support 
and partnership."
"The Zalando Management Board is confident about the opportunities ahead, 
and we look forward to executing our shared vision for the company's future success."
"Zalando continued to play a pioneering role in many areas in 2023, taking a leadership role to 
solve challenges that are relevant to the fashion and lifestyle industry."
"For example, we 
introduced tools that improve our customers’ size recommendations based on their unique 
body measurements, helping to reduce size-related returns and textile waste."
"Zalando also 
launched a fashion assistant based on generative artificial intelligence, allowing customers to 
more easily navigate our assortment using their own words or fashion terms and ultimately 
helping them find their desired items faster."
"To entertain customers and deepen our relationship with them, the company launched ‘Stories 
on Zalando’, a new immersive visual-first fashion experience that redefines the discovery of 
exciting fashion and culture trends."
"Zalando invested in these strategically important areas in a year that was marked by high 
inflation and low consumer sentiment in the markets in which it operates."
"Challenging 
macroeconomics meant the company had to demonstrate resilience and agility to adapt to the 
changing environment."
"The company carried through a program to reduce complexity and 
embrace simplicity."
"Zalando is working to further enhance practices with regard to environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) factors, aligning with the belief that sustainable business practices are 
integral to long-term success."
"For example, we are working to weave sustainability more 
closely into all aspects of our business to help make fashion and lifestyle a more sustainable 
industry, with a lower environmental footprint and a more equitable, transparent and circular 
supply chain."
"Updating our remuneration system for the Management Board has been an important 
corporate governance initiative over the past few months."
"The Supervisory Board Chairperson 
spoke with investors and with the management board to evaluate the company’s needs and 
identify improvement areas as well as addressing concerns raised by shareholders and proxy 
advisors."
"Crucially, it will allow Zalando to attract and retain the best talent from around the 
world."
"The Supervisory Board reappointed Co-CEOs Robert Gentz and David Schneider for four-year 
terms commencing on December 1, 2023."
"We are thrilled that the founders have renewed their 
commitment at this important time, driving the growth strategy by building on the company’s 
unique capabilities and offerings."
"One of the keys to Zalando’s success since it was founded in 2008 has been its ability to 
understand significant shifts impacting the world and its industry early on and translate them 
into opportunities to solve challenges for customers and partners."
"Zalando’s entrepreneurial 
and can-do mindset made it one of the first and few European success stories of a large-scale 
digital consumer company both emerging in, and focused on, Europe."
"The industry is again undergoing significant change, opening up tremendous opportunities and 
the possibility to shape the industry’s future."
"Zalando is working to seize those opportunities 
with quality offerings and have a net-positive impact for people and the planet."
"Companies at 
the forefront of the changing landscape that make smart investments will be able to create 
demand, decoupling themselves from the wider sector."
"In consultation with the supervisory board, Zalando has further developed its strategy to steer 
investment decisions."
"The vision is to build an ecosystem for fashion and Lifestyle e-
commerce."
"The company will increasingly differentiate its e-commerce experience through 
quality to make sure customers and partners recognize and appreciate the high value of 
experiences, services and offers."
"Zalando is also working to make the discovery of fashion and 
lifestyle products more fun as it becomes the go-to place for discovery and entertainment."
"The 
B2B strategy is to become an enabler for the e-commerce transactions of business customers 
across Europe by offering an operating system for fashion and lifestyle to merchants."
"In summary, we remain committed to fostering innovation, being change-makers, and 
delivering value to our shareholders."
"The Supervisory Board will continue active dialogue with 
the Management Board to advise and support, ensuring that the company is well positioned to 
achieve its strategic ambitions and financial goals in the future."

Introduction
A founder-led company, Zalando has evolved rapidly from a start-up selling flip-flops out of a 
flat in Berlin in 2008 to a leading European destination for fashion and lifestyle with around 50 
million active customers."
"Our success is a direct result of the company’s entrepreneurial spirit 
and culture, and the remuneration system for our Management Board has always reflected our 
“Act like an Owner” principle."
"At the same time, Zalando’s remuneration framework has 
evolved to reflect our development in meeting stakeholder needs, attracting and retaining 
talent, and adapting to our changing operating environment."
"The Supervisory Board is proposing adjustments to the remuneration system for our 
Management Board and will submit these for approval to the annual general meeting 2024."
"The adjustments are in line with market practice and reflect proposals made by shareholders 
and proxy advisors at the annual general meeting on May 24, 2023 in connection with the 
resolution on the approval of the remuneration report for the fiscal year 2022."
"They also 
ensure that remuneration promotes the realization of our business strategy and at the same 
time maintain the distinctive entrepreneurial elements that have made us the successful 
company we are today."

our Supervisory Board."

new remuneration system fully complies with all recommendations of the German Corporate 
Governance Code, demonstrating our commitment to best practices in corporate governance."

Zalando SE
ANNUAL REPORT 2023
Two significant changes are worth highlighting."
"First, the existing Zalando Ownership Plan 
(ZOP) will be replaced by a Zalando Growth Incentive (ZGI), introducing financial targets into 
the short-term variable remuneration component."
"The ZGI will be a market-standard cash-
settled short-term incentive that depends upon the achievement of annual financial targets."
"In 
order to further promote an entrepreneurial culture, the Management Board will be obliged to 
reinvest 50% of the net payouts under the ZGI in Zalando shares with a holding period of one 
year."
"As a result of the introduction of the ZGI, the members of the Management Board no 
longer have the flexibility to individually determine the proportion of remuneration instruments 
during their term of office."
"Secondly, the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) grant will be changed to an 
annual grant structure, replacing the previous sequential grant model in order to align the 
incentive structure within our Management Board and to increase transparency of the 
remuneration levels."
"Changes in the composition of the Management Board and Supervisory 
Board during 2023
In the reporting year 2023, Robert Gentz and David Schneider continued to lead our company 
as Co-CEOs."
"Dr. Sandra Dembeck (CFO), David Schröder (COO) and Dr. Astrid Arndt (CPO) 
also continued to be members of the Management Board during the reporting period."
"Our Co-CEOs Robert Gentz and David Schneider were reappointed as members of the 
Management Board for a period of four years starting December 1, 2023 until November 30, 
2027."
"Further, David Schröder was reappointed as member of the Management Board as of 
April 1, 2023 for a period of four years until March 31, 2027."
"Jim Freeman (CBPO) left the 
company upon expiry of his term of office on March 31, 2023."
"The term of office of all shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board expired at the 
end of the Annual General Meeting on May 24, 2023."
"With the exception of Cristina Stenbeck, 
all shareholder representatives were re-elected at the annual general meeting on May 24, 
2023."
"Cristina Stenbeck did not stand for re-election after serving on the Supervisory Board 
from 2014 to 2016 and from 2019 to 2023."
"In her place, Susanne Schröter-Crossan was newly 
appointed to the Supervisory Board."
"All shareholder representatives were elected for a term 
ending at the Annual General Meeting that will decide on the discharge of liability for the fiscal 
year 2024."
"Kelly Bennett was elected chairperson and Mariella Röhm-Kottmann was elected 
deputy chairperson of the Supervisory Board."
"For further details on the composition of the 
various Supervisory Board committees please refer to section 2.5 of the Corporate 
Governance statement."
"Design of the Remuneration System 2021
The Remuneration System 2021 is designed to contribute significantly to the promotion and 
execution of the business strategy, as well as the sustainable long-term development of the 
Zalando group."
"It ensures remuneration that is appropriate and at market standard for the 
members of the Management Board, in order to attract and retain the talent required to 
achieve our strategic ambitions."
"Remuneration is based on performance targets and considers 
in our opinion appropriately the performance of each member of the Management Board."
"In 
this context, we believe that actions of the members of the Management Board are oriented 
towards the interests of shareholders, resulting e.g."
"in no or considerably lower payouts of 
variable remuneration in the case of a declining share price or moderate payouts in the case of 
moderate share price increases."
"The fixed integration of Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) targets into the remuneration structure encourages sustainable and future-
oriented action."
"The overall structure is further designed to promote an entrepreneurial culture 
of ownership in the Management Board and across our company."
"The ZOP 2021 Shares and the ZOP 2021 Options may be settled, at the election of 
the company, in shares of the company or in cash."
"The LTI 2021 Shares and the LTI 2021 Options may be settled, at the election of the 
company, in shares of the company or in cash."
"The remaining 40% can be allocated 
flexibly, depending on personal circumstances and preferences: A minimum of 10% and a 
maximum of 40% of the target total remuneration is represented by the fixed remuneration 
component (i.e."
fixed salary plus fringe benefits).
"Consequently, the ZOP 2021 makes up 
between 0% and 30% of the target total remuneration, traded-off with the fixed remuneration 
component."
"Composition as % of target total remuneration
Determination of the appropriate remuneration
The Supervisory Board sets the remuneration for the Management Board pursuant to Section 
87 (1) AktG."
"In order to ensure an appropriate remuneration of the members of the Management Board, the 
Supervisory Board further considers the level of remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board in relation to the remuneration structure within the company."
"As a matter 
of principle, the Supervisory Board and its remuneration committee consult external experts to 
develop the remuneration system and to assess the appropriateness of the remuneration."
"Application of the Remuneration System 2021
At the beginning of the reporting year 2023, the Remuneration System 2021 was only applied 
to the service agreements of our Management Board members Dr. Sandra Dembeck (CFO) and 
Dr. Astrid Arndt (CPO)."
"Our Co-CEOs Robert Gentz and David Schneider as well as our COO 
David Schröder had service agreements that were entered into before the implementation of 
the Remuneration System 2021 and which entitle them to option rights under the previous 
long-term incentive programs LTI 2018 and LTI 2019."
"In particular, the remuneration under the new 
service agreements of our Co-CEOs Robert Gentz and David Schneider and our COO David 
Schröder was benchmarked with the companies included in the DAX and MDAX by an 
independent external expert."
"To put the remuneration levels of this benchmark exercise into 
an international perspective, the Supervisory Board also acknowledged the remuneration 
levels of technology-driven peer companies in Europe and the USA."
"2 The Supervisory Board 
also considered to base the new service agreements of our Co-CEOs Robert Gentz and David 
Schneider upon the new remuneration system that will be presented to the annual general 
meeting on May 17, 2024 for approval."
"Statutory law required the Supervisory Board, however, 
to apply the Remuneration System 2021 as this system has been approved by the company’s 
General Meeting."
"All solutions to incorporate potential changes through the new remuneration 
system into the service agreements entailed legal and economic risks, in particular due to the 
numerous uncertainties that would have to be taken into account."
"Therefore, the Supervisory 
Board decided after a thorough review that it is in the best interest of the company to base the 
new service agreements of our Co-CEOs with a runtime of four years on the current 
Remuneration System 2021."
"As of today, the Remuneration System 2021 applies thus for all current service agreements 
with the members of the Management Board."
"This facilitates the comparison and increases the 
transparency of the Management Board member remuneration."
"The last waiting period ended on July 31, 2023."
"**) 
The LTI 2019 contains different waiting periods."
"The last waiting period ended on March 30, 2023."
"Remuneration structure of the service agreements which are based 
upon the Remuneration System 2021
As just described, all current service agreements of the members of the Management Board 
are based upon the Remuneration System 2021."
"1.3.3
Description of our option programs
In addition to the option programs ZOP 2021 and LTI 2021 under the Remuneration System 
2021, there are several different previous option programs under which (virtual) stock options 
were granted to Management Board members over the past years."
"In the following, we will 
describe all options programs that are relevant for this remuneration report, including the ZOP 
2021 and the LTI 2021."
"ZOP 2021
The ZOP 2021
3 is a variable remuneration component under the Remuneration System 2021."
"Its share-based structure contributes to the alignment of the interests of the members of the 
Management Board with those of our shareholders in promoting the long-term development 
and growth of the company."
"Under the ZOP 2021, virtual options in the form of ZOP 2021 Shares (with an exercise price of 
EUR 1.00) and/or ZOP 2021 Options (with an exercise price of the share price at grant) are 
granted in quarterly tranches."
"The Management Board members can freely determine the 
proportion of ZOP 2021 Shares and of ZOP 2021 Options (in steps of 5%) during a fixed 
annual selection window."
"The ZOP 2021 Shares are not subject to a waiting period, whereas 
the ZOP 2021 Options only are exercisable after a waiting period of two years."
"Upon exercise, 
the ZOP 2021 entitles the member of the Management Board to a cash payment in the amount 
of the difference between the company’s share price
4 as per the exercise date and the 
exercise price of the respective virtual option."
"The company is entitled to settle its obligation 
by delivering treasury shares instead of making a cash payment."
"For the 
purpose of this remuneration report, all different ZOP plan rules under the Remuneration System 2021 are collectively referred to as “ZOP 2021”."
"4  
To the extent the company’s share price does not exceed the applicable share price cap of the ZOP 2021."
"LTI 2021
Along with the ZOP 2021, the LTI 2021
5 is the second variable remuneration component under 
the Remuneration System 2021."
"The LTI 2021 is a performance-related long-term 
remuneration component that is linked to our strategic financial performance targets and, 
through the introduction of an ESG modifier, the sustainable development of the company."
"The company is entitled to settle its 
obligation by delivering treasury shares instead of making a cash payment."
"Upon conclusion of a service agreement with a Management Board member, the Supervisory 
Board sets ambitious financial and ESG performance targets for a performance period which 
equals the term of the service agreement."
"The financial performance targets relate to the 
growth of the company’s GMV."
"As additional financial performance targets the company’s 
adjusted EBIT or revenue may be considered."
"The final number of exercisable virtual options 
under the LTI 2021 depends on the extent to which the targeted rate of the financial and ESG 
performance targets is met during the performance period."
"For the purpose of this remuneration report, all different LTI plan rules under the Remuneration System 2021 are 
collectively referred to as “LTI 2021”."
"6  
To the extent the company’s share price does not exceed the applicable share price cap of the LTI 2021."
"In the case of our CFO Dr. Sandra Dembeck and our CPO Dr. Astrid Arndt, the financial target 
of their LTI 2021 remuneration component relates only to the growth of the company’s GMV as 
shown in the overview."
"The weighting of 
their financial targets is two-thirds for the GMV target and one-third for the adjusted EBIT 
margin target."
"The 
relevant adjusted EBIT margin during the performance period is based on the equally weighted 
average adjusted EBIT margin for each year of the four years’ performance period."
"The number of exercisable options under the LTI 2021 after the waiting period is calculated in 
a first step by multiplying the target achievement rate of the financial performance target with 
the number of vested options under the LTI 2021."
"In a second step, the ESG modifier needs to 
be considered."
"In this regard, ESG performance targets in the field of sustainability and 
diversity and inclusion (D&I) have been set."
"The achievement of the ESG 
performance targets is considered by means of a modifier that leads to a reduction between 0 
and 20 percentage points of the number of exercisable options under the LTI 2021."
"The first sub-period ends 
in all cases on March 31, 2025."
"The sustainability targets for the second sub-period shall be 
determined by the Supervisory Board in accordance with the sustainability targets as set out in 
the do.MORE strategy (or equivalent strategy) of the company for 2025 onwards that is 
currently prepared."
"The sustainability targets for the second sub-period displayed in the 
overview are a fall-back solution and shall only apply if no new determination of sustainability 
targets will take place (e.g."
"because the do.MORE strategy is not available as planned until 
2025)."
"The performance measurement and evaluation based on the performance targets set out 
above can only be completed following the end of the relevant performance period."
"The target 
achievement will be disclosed in the remuneration report following the end of the respective 
performance period."
"Both LTI 2019 and LTI 2018 are shared-based option programs whereas the LTI 
2019 only grants virtual stock options while the LTI 2018 grants both real (equity) stock 
options as well as virtual stock options."
"Under both programs, each option relates to one share 
in the company but different exercise prices apply."
"VSOP 2018
Jim Freeman, our former CBPO, left the Management Board at the end of March 31, 2023."
"Prior to his appointment as Management Board member on April 1, 2019, he had served the 
company as SVP Engineering and participated in the Virtual Stock Option Program (VSOP) 
2018 at that time from which there are no outstanding options at the end of the reporting 
period."
Further details on the VSOP 2018 can be found in the remuneration report 2022.
"SOP 2013
The former member of the Management Board Rubin Ritter participated among others in the 
pre-IPO long-term incentive Stock Option Program (SOP) 2013, which granted real stock 
options rather than virtual entitlements."
"All options granted under the SOP 2013 were 
exercised prior to the reporting period."
"Further details on the SOP 2013 can be found in the 
remuneration report 2022."
"not including Partner Program commission only as in revenue, but treating the Partner Program as wholesale, thus 
grossed up to show 100% of the Partner Program merchandise volume."
"1.3.4
Target Total Remuneration
The target total remuneration for each member of the Management Board is determined by the 
Supervisory Board in compliance with statutory provisions and the requirements of the 
applicable remuneration system."
"The amount of the target total remuneration is the sum of all 
fixed and variable remuneration components for one year in the event of 100% target 
achievement."
"The following tables show the individual target values, along with the minimum and maximum 
values, for the remuneration components contractually agreed for the reporting year 2023."
Fringe benefits are not included in the overview.
"The maximum values shown are purely arithmetical and do not take 
into account the applicable contractual maximum limits for the total remuneration (cf."
the description under 1.3.7).
"9  
The target total remuneration for Robert Gentz is calculated pro-rata on the basis of his service agreement that ran from December 1, 2018 until 
November 30, 2023 and his new service agreements that came into effect as of December 1, 2023."
"The annualized target total remuneration 
under Robert Gentz’ service agreement as of December 1, 2018 amounted to EUR 6.4m."
"10  
The target total remuneration for David Schneider is calculated pro-rata on the basis of his service agreement that ran from December 1, 2018 
until November 30, 2023 and his new service agreements that came into effect as of December 1, 2023."
"The annualized target total 
remuneration under David Schneider’s service agreement as of December 1, 2018 amounted to EUR 6.4m."
"The annualized target total remuneration under David 
Schröder’s service agreement of April 1, 2018 amounted to EUR 2.5m whereby the ZOP 2021 component amounts to EUR 790,000 per year."
"The 
target amount of the ZOP 2021 component displayed in this overview differs slightly from the mathematical pro rata amount due to rounding 
differences in relation with the quarterly granting of the ZOP 2021 Shares and ZOP 2021 Options."
"12  
In the case of our CPO Dr. Astrid Arndt, the maximum amount of fringe benefits per year amounts to EUR 25,000."
"Non-paid out fringe benefits 
are paid out in addition to the fixed salary."
"The target total remuneration determined for each member of the Management Board was set 
in an adequate proportion to the responsibilities and performance of the respective member of 
the Management Board and to the situation of the company."
"In addition, the Supervisory 
Board ensured that the target total remuneration was in line with market practice."
"1.3.5
Development of outstanding options
The following overviews show the development of the outstanding options in the reporting 
period for current and former members of our Management Board under the option programs 
described above under section 1.3.3 Description of our option programs."
"**) 
All 42,814 options exercised in 2023 were exercised on June 5, 2023 at EUR 1.00."
***) All options were exercised at a share price below the share price cap.
"Those options are still allocated to both members of 
the Management Board and therefore included in the table."
"**) 
In fiscal year 2022, a number of 100,000 options were transferred by the former Management Board member Rubin Ritter to a charitable limited 
liability company."
Those options are still allocated to the former member of the Management Board and therefore included in the table.
"**) 
All options were exercised at a share price below the share price cap."
"This 
reduced the number of these options to 2,503,246, of which 200,000 were exercised in 2018, 170,571 in 2019, 800,000 in 2020, 925,200 in 
2021 and 407,475 in 2022."
"Of 407,475 options exercised in 2022 100,000 options were exercised on March 7, 2022 and 307,475 options were 
exercised on May 19, 2022."
All options were exercised at EUR 1.00.
"The remuneration includes all amounts actually 
received (gewährte Vergütung) as well as all amounts legally due but not yet received 
(geschuldete Vergütung)."
"The concept of this reporting leads to the result that variable remuneration components under 
our option programs are only shown to the extent that options were actually exercised in the 
fiscal year 2023 (and 2022 respectively)."
"**) 
For a total of 1,500,000 options granted under LTI 2018, of which each 750,000 options were granted to Robert Gentz and David Schneider, the 
applicable performance criteria has been fulfilled in 2023."
"The target achievement has been 100% so that all of the 1,500,000 options have 
become exercisable in 2023."
"Because the exercise price of 47.44 EUR was above the closing price of 21.45 EUR at the end of the performance 
period, the corresponding remuneration awarded and due is nil."
"***) With respect to negative tax consequences resulting for the former member of the Management Board Jim Freeman as a citizen of the United 
States of America from the application of certain provisions of Sec."
"Internal Revenue Code, specific rules of the LTI 2019 have 
been amended (the Restated LTI 2019) and 68,500 options vested by March 31, 2020 have been canceled and settled by the company as cash 
and share consideration."
"The company has indemnified Jim Freeman from the tax penalty under US law imposed on the settlement value and the 
remaining options under the Restated LTI 2019, whereby the indemnity in relation to remaining options is capped and will not exceed the amount 
which would have been payable."
if the relevant per-share value of the respective remaining options for purposes of calculating the respective penalties had been EUR 55.00.
"This 
additional remuneration was a market-standard compensation for the fact that Dr. Sandra 
Dembeck lost claims against her previous employer due to the termination of her former 
contractual relation relationship."
"The following table shows the remuneration awarded and due as well as remuneration 
according to option exercises in the fiscal year 2023 (and 2022 respectively) for the former 
Management Board members Rubin Ritter and Jim Freeman received after the end of their 
respective service agreements."
"The exercise of the SOP 2013 program was settled in 
conditional capital so as not to draw cash from the company, which was instead invested into 
further growing the business."
"Thus, these options represent and were granted for 
(performance) periods between 2013 and 2017, hence well before the reporting year 2023 
when the company was at an early stage of its development."
"The current and former members of the Management Board did not receive any remuneration 
from other group companies in fiscal year 2023 (and 2022 respectively)."

The maximum remuneration stipulated in the Remuneration System 2021 amounts to 
EUR 15.75m for each of our Co-CEOs and to EUR 10.5m for each of the further members of 
the Management Board."
"All current service agreements of the Management Board members 
provide for caps in line with the Remuneration System 2021."
"In the current service agreements of our Management Board members, the total remuneration 
for each of our Co-CEOs Robert Gentz and David Schneider per fiscal year is capped at 
EUR 15.75m, for Dr. Sandra Dembeck at EUR 6.84m, for David Schröder at EUR 10m and for 
Dr. Astrid Arndt at EUR 5.25m."
"Application of malus and clawback during reporting year 
(Section 162 (1) Sentence 2 No."
"4 AktG)
The Remuneration System 2021 and – in its implementation – the service agreements of the 
members of the Management Board provide for malus and clawback clauses."
"In such a 
case, the Supervisory Board may, at its sole discretion, reclaim in whole or in part variable 
remuneration that has already been paid out (clawback)."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board 
has the possibility to reclaim variable remuneration in the case of an undue payout based on 
incorrect information."
"In the fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board did not make use of the option to retain (malus) 
or reclaim (clawback) variable remuneration components as none of the above conditions were 
ascertained by the Supervisory Board."
"The service agreements of the members of the Management Board which were concluded 
before the year 2021 do not include malus or clawback provisions."
"This does not affect the 
applicable legal situation regarding any claims for damages on the part of the company against 
the Management Board members in the event of culpable breaches of duty (such as according 
to Section 93 (2) AktG)."
"Also, there are no outstanding benefits that were promised by third 
parties to the members of the Management Board."
"Benefits promised to the members of the Management Board in the event of regular or early 
termination (Section 162 (2) No."
"In the event of permanent incapacity to work, the service agreement will end without notice 
of termination being required at the end of the calendar quarter in which such permanent 
incapacity to work is determined."
"Also unvested options under the LTI 2021, the LTI 2019 and the LTI 2018 which would have 
vested during the following two years can be kept by the member of the Management Board 
and continue to vest in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable LTI 
scheme."
"Under the VSOP 2018, in a leaver event (as further defined) the virtual stock options granted 
will irrevocably cease to vest, and all of the unvested virtual stock options will be forfeited 
without entitlement to compensation."
"In the case of a bad leaver event all vested and unexer-
cised virtual stock options will be forfeited without entitlement to compensation."
"In the case of 
a leaver event that does not qualify as a bad leaver event (good leaver event) all of the vested 
and unexercised virtual stock options are retained."
"Entitlements upon a change of control
If the office or service agreement of a member of the Management Board ends due to a 
change of control, there are no contractually agreed change-of-control severance 
entitlements."
"There are also no specific contractually agreed termination rights for the 
members of the Management Board in the event of a change of control."
"The remaining vested virtual 
stock options not subject to the cancellation request remain unaffected."
"The existing variable remuneration programs do not provide for any accelerated vesting in the 
case of a change of control."
"Post-contractual non-compete clause
A post-contractual non-competition clause and accordingly also a promise of a non-compete 
compensation payment have not been agreed in the service contracts of the Management 
Board members who were active as Management Board members in the reporting year."
"Benefits promised or granted to a former member of the Management Board whose position 
ended in the course of the reporting year (Section 162 (2) No."

of the remuneration system for the Management Board of Zalando in accordance with 
Section 87a (1) Sentence 2 AktG if this is necessary in the interest of the long-term welfare 
of the company."
"During the fiscal year 2023, there was no deviation from the Remuneration 
System 2021."
"1.3.8
Remuneration of Supervisory Board members
The remuneration system for the members of the Supervisory Board is based on the legal 
requirements and takes into account the recommendations and suggestions of the German 
Corporate Governance Code."
"Except for these adjustments, the former remuneration system for the Supervisory 
Board members as resolved upon by the annual general meeting 2021 remained unchanged."
"The remuneration of Supervisory Board members is governed by Article 15 of the Articles of 
Association."
"The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board is balanced overall 
and commensurate with the responsibilities and tasks of the members of the Supervisory 
Board and the situation of the company, taking into account the remuneration arrangements 
of other large listed companies."
"The members of the Supervisory Board receive a purely 
function-related fixed remuneration in accordance with Clause G.18 of the German Corporate 
Governance Code."
"No performance-related remuneration or financial or non-financial 
performance criteria are provided for."
"This best reflects the independent supervisory and 
advisory function of the Supervisory Board, which is not geared to short-term corporate 
success but to the long-term development of the company."
"The fixed annual remuneration is EUR 200,000 (previously 180,000) for the chairperson of the 
Supervisory Board, EUR 135,000 for the deputy chairperson of the Supervisory Board and 
EUR 90,000 for every other member of the Supervisory Board."
"For their work on the audit 
committee, members of the Supervisory Board receive an additional fixed annual remuneration 
of EUR 20,000 (previously 10,000)."
"The chairperson of the audit committee receives an 
additional fixed annual remuneration of EUR 65,000 (previously 50,000)."
"The respective amount of the fixed remuneration takes into account the specific function and 
responsibility of the members of the Supervisory Board."
Attendance fees are not paid.
"The remuneration falls due at the end of the 
fiscal year for which the remuneration is paid."
"In addition to the function-related fixed remuneration, the members of the Supervisory Board 
are reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of the 
Supervisory Board mandate as well as any value added tax payable on their remuneration and 
expenses."
"Furthermore, the members of the Supervisory Board are included in a D&O liability 
insurance policy for board members maintained by the company in the company’s interests 
that will provide reasonable coverage against financial damages."
"The premiums for this 
insurance policy are paid by the company."
"The annual general meeting determines the remuneration of the members of the Super-
visory Board upon proposal of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in the 
Articles of Association or by resolution."
"The general meeting resolves on the remuneration 
of the members of the Supervisory Board at least every four years."

"Should the general meeting not 
confirm the remuneration system submitted to a vote, a revised remuneration system must 
be submitted to the following annual general meeting at the latest."
"The Supervisory Board may also 
carry out a horizontal market comparison for this purpose."
"In doing so, the Supervisory Board 
may seek advice from an external remuneration expert."

Comparative presentation of the development of the 
remuneration
In accordance with Section 162 (1) Sentence 2 No."
"The remuneration of the Management Board members for the year 2019 is based on the 
amount of “benefits received” as reported in the annual report 2019."
"The presentation of the average employee remuneration is based on the total workforce 
employed by Zalando SE."
"While the yearly target and fixed average remuneration on a full-
time equivalent basis of employees increased year-on-year, the figures below show the 
remuneration including option exercises in the relevant year."
"In 2021, a higher amount of 
employee equity remuneration was exercised compared to 2022."
"Taking into account the 
holding periods over several years for the employee share programs, the figures shown are 
distorted."
"The development of the company’s net income is shown alongside the development of the 
revenue of the Zalando group."
"We have not audited the content 
of the disclosures of the remuneration report in sections “1.3.1 Introduction” where they go 
beyond the scope of Section 162 AktG."
"Responsibilities of the executive directors and the Supervisory Board
The executive directors and Supervisory Board of Zalando SE are responsible for the 
preparation of the remuneration report and the related disclosures in compliance with the 
requirements of Section 162 AktG."
"Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report and the related 
disclosures based on our audit."
"We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der 
Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Those standards require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the remuneration report and the related disclosures are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the 
remuneration report and the related disclosures."
"The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgment, This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
remuneration report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error."
"An audit also includes evaluating 
the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the 
executive directors and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation 
of the remuneration report and the related disclosures."
"We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion."
"We do not 
express an opinion on the content of the abovementioned disclosures of the remuneration 
report that go beyond the scope of Sec."
"Other matter – formal audit of the remuneration report
The audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor’s report comprises 
the formal audit of the remuneration report required by Section 162 (3) AktG and the issue of a 
report on this audit."
"As we are issuing an unqualified opinion on the audit of the content of the 
remuneration report, this also includes the opinion that the disclosures pursuant to Section 
162 (1) and (2) AktG are made in the remuneration report in all material respects."

"Top 10 shareholders represent around 57%

"1.4.1
Capital markets and share price development
In 2023, major equity indices experienced positive trends."
"However, persistent 
macroeconomic uncertainty, tighter monetary policies, and subdued consumer and business 
sentiment continue to exert pressure on the macroeconomic environment."
"The leading 
German Stock market index DAX showed a positive development during the first half of the 
year, extending the trend until end of July, 2023."
"The upturn is primarily attributed to a 
reduction in inflation and the gradual recovery following a negative trajectory in 2022."
"However, from July, 2023 onwards, the DAX index experienced a declining trend until 
October, 2023 which can be attributed to tightening financial conditions, persistent inflation,

"In particular, it 
reviews the financial statements and management reports, and it reports on the audit to the

"Our Supervisory Board is made up of long-term investors, employees 
and independent experts."
"For more information in regards to the Supervisory Board, please 
refer to section 2.5.5 Supervisory Board."
"Group segments
Zalando SE’s internal management structure in 2023 was based on a sales channel 
perspective."
"Our main sales channel continued to be the segment Fashion Store (Zalando app 
and website)."
"The Offprice segment included the sales channels Lounge by Zalando (Lounge 
by Zalando app and website), brick-and-mortar outlet stores and B2B overstock management."
"In addition, all other segments of Zalando bundled the emerging businesses Zalando 
Marketing Services (ZMS), the integrator business Tradebyte and Highsnobiety’s publishing 
arm, creative consultancy and curated commerce platform."
"Revenue and profitability generated with external business partners as well as the internal 
transactions between our segments are reported to the Management Board."
"As a result, a 
reconciliation column is included in the segment reporting to reconcile the segment figures 
(including internal and external transactions) to the consolidated group figures (showing only 
external transactions)."
"From 2024 onwards, our steering and decision-making will start from our customers, shifting 
from a sales channel view (Fashion Store and Offprice) to a customer-focused distinction 
between B2C and B2B (refer to the reshape of the organization in section 2.1.1 Business 
model)."
Our external reporting will be adjusted to reflect these two operating segments.
"The 
majority of our business stays with our B2C business and its supporting services, including our 
partner program and ZMS."
"The B2B segment will comprise services that provide B2B products 
we offer to our partners on and off our Zalando Platform to meet their business needs (i.e."
"ZEOS Logistics, Tradebyte and Highsnobiety)."

fashion and lifestyle products, inspiration and content."

achieving this goal, serving around 50 million active customers in 25 markets across Europe 
and generating EUR 14.8bn in GMV in 2023."

sustainable and equitable fashion future."

time, translate into a highly attractive financial profile with growth, profitability and cash 
generation at scale."
"From a customer perspective, we seek to increase the size and quality of our active customer 
base and build deeper customer relationships."
"We will achieve this by enhancing the quality 
and relevance of our multiple fashion and lifestyle propositions and by investing in making our 
e-commerce experience personalized, engaging, inspirational and entertaining."
"We will always 
lead with quality, offering our customers the very best brands they love, an experience 
characterized by trust, innovative and entertaining digital experiences, and the ability to make 
more sustainable and inclusive choices."

sizable and attractive business opportunity by connecting them with around 50 million active 
customers across Europe."

to create an operating system for fashion and lifestyle in Europe, enabling brands and retailers 
to manage their multi-channel businesses within one unified platform across the continent via 
Zalando."

targets."

by 2040 and across our whole business by 2050."
"Second, we are committed to ensuring 
decent work, responsible purchasing practices and paying a fair share of living wages in our

a fashion destination that is welcoming to everyone."

and celebrate the diversity of our customers, partners and teams."

destination for fashion and lifestyle in Europe – a fashion market that has an estimated value 
of EUR 450bn."

more and more sales are touched by digital elements, we aspire to further increase our market 
share."

with a CAGR between 5-10% until 2028."

target of up to 6-8% by the end of 2028, and we believe our strategy will yield even greater 
profitability and strong cash generation in the longer term."
"In addition to focusing on the attractive growth opportunity ahead of us, we are also 
committed to pushing forward with decisive measures and strategic activities to improve the 
speed of execution and increase the immediate and longer-term profitability of our business."

ANNUAL REPORT 2023
Market environment
The market environment remains challenging for the fashion industry."
"In 2023, Zalando was 
impacted by the difficult macroeconomic environment, weak consumer sentiment, continued 
pressure on disposable income and declining online sales."
"While lower energy prices have 
helped to reduce headline inflation, core inflation is proving to be persistent and the impact of 
higher interest rates continues to be felt across the economy
15."
"While the EU consumer 
confidence indicator has steadily improved from a record low of -29.8 in September 2022 to 
-16.0 in December 2023
16, it remains materially below pre-pandemic levels."
"In Germany, real 
domestic product contracted by 0.3% in 2023
17, driven by weak foreign demand in industry, 
sluggish private consumption, and higher financing costs for investment due to a tightening of 
monetary policy."
"In addition, the ongoing post-pandemic trend of normalization between 
online and offline sales channels continued, as some consumers returned to shopping more 
frequently in brick-and-mortar stores."
"Strategic progress
Customers
We aim to reach a growing share of the more than 500 million people in our target markets."
"Despite the challenging market environment and weak consumer sentiment, Zalando served 
around 50m active customers across Europe in 2023."
"With approximately 10% of the relevant 
European population as current active Zalando customers, there is still substantial room to 
grow this customer base."
"We will always lead with quality and offer our 
customers the very best brands they love, an experience characterized by trust, innovative 
and entertaining digital experiences, and the ability to make more sustainable and inclusive 
choices."

curated selection we are known for on our platform or the seamless convenience we offer our 
customers."
"Customer Propositions
This year, we continued to advance our mission to offer customers the highest quality and 
most relevant and curated shopping experience across all our fashion and lifestyle 
propositions."
"We added a number of key brand partners in 2023 to strengthen our brand portfolio and spark 
even more excitement for our customers."
"This includes the additions of lululemon and HOKA 
to Zalando Sports."
"Exclusive and curated limited edition product drops with brands such as 
Adidas and Salomon throughout the year increased customer engagement and provided 
people with even more reasons to come back and visit Zalando more regularly."
"In Beauty, 
Zalando collaborated for the first time this year with innovative and ethical beauty brand, Lush."
"A new luxury boutique-style space for Designer brands was rolled out in 2023 with an elevated 
and differentiated look and feel."
"These changes have made Zalando even more attractive for 
luxury brands, giving them more control over how they appear on the platform and additional 
ways to protect their all-important brand equity."
"The space also invites a new generation of 
luxury customers to discover a fresh, differentiated and inspiring designer shopping 
experience."
"This initiative plays into our overall strategy to make Zalando a higher quality 
experience and offer customers more opportunities to trade up to more elevated assortments 
and brands."
"We also worked with a number of brands within our Designer proposition this year 
on exclusive and curated limited edition capsules and product drops."
"For example, a Spring/
Summer 2023 collection with Paco Rabanne featuring 40 pieces embodying its iconic design 
which was only available on Zalando."
"Lounge by Zalando was also relaunched with an enhanced on-site customer experience and a 
new brand identity in January."

Offprice website and app."
"In addition, new Zalando Outlets were opened in Frankfurt and 
Bielefeld, bringing the total number of Offprice brick-and-mortar stores to 15."
"We are pleased 
to see customers embracing the opportunity to try on and purchase certified second-hand Pre-
Owned articles in these destinations, in addition to using our dedicated online Pre-Owned 
offer."

This year, we continued to invest in strategic initiatives targeted at further improving our 
onsite and in-app shopping experience and creating more engaging, inspiring, entertaining 
and innovative content and experiences for our customers and partners."
"Launched in September, ‘Stories on Zalando’ is a new inspirational experience created in 
collaboration with Highsnobiety, the influential global fashion and lifestyle media brand in 
which Zalando acquired a majority stake in 2022."
"‘Stories on Zalando’ offers our customers 
curated content in visual-first formats such as short videos and other new ways to discover 
fashion and culture trends."
"The launch of Stories was accompanied in December by the release of a new, invitation-only 
shopping experience for the most hyped articles on Zalando."
"This feature allows customers to 
purchase the hottest items, which are available in strictly limited quantities, in the same way 
and with the same convenience they are accustomed to when shopping for other articles on 
Zalando."
"FENTY x PUMA Avanti in December was the first product drop for ‘Stories on 
Zalando’ featuring this new experience."
"A new AI-powered size recommendation feature launched in selected markets this year helps 
customers find the right size and fit based on their own body measurements."
"This experience 
is based on technology developed by Zalando and Fision, a Swiss mobile body measurement 
app developer which Zalando acquired in 2020."
"We introduced the beta version of an AI-powered fashion assistant in 2023 in selected 
markets."
"The technology allows customers to ask questions using their own fashion terms and 
words, helping them navigate Zalando’s large assortment in a more intuitive way."
"We are 
excited to see how we can leverage generative AI in new ways to make our customer 
experience even more engaging."
"Partners
The strength of Zalando’s brand partnerships and our platform approach have always been 
an integral part of our business strategy."
"Thousands of globally recognized, locally relevant 
and emerging brands partnered with Zalando to grow their businesses in 2023."
"These close 
partnerships enable us to offer our customers a curated assortment and create substantial 
benefits for customers, partners and Zalando."
"We continue to work with our partners to find 
new and innovative ways to connect our customers with the most relevant and curated brands 
and articles through a combination of our Wholesale and Partner Businesses."
"Wholesale
Back in 2008, Zalando was founded as a wholesale-retail e-commerce business."
"Wholesale 
means that we buy inventory from brands and sell it to customers for our own account."
"Our 
Wholesale business contributed 61% of Zalando Fashion Store GMV in the last quarter of 
2023 (vs."
"We view this Wholesale model as an essential pillar of our 
assortment strategy and one of the most important tools that we have to secure and curate 
“must-have” assortment for our customers across Europe."

Our Partner Program and Connected Retail  enable brands and retailers to sell their 
merchandise via Zalando while maintaining full control over their offer, content, and pricing."

represented roughly 2% of Fashion Store GMV (vs."
also roughly 2% in 2022).

by design, bringing to life the diversity of our talents, leaders, customers and partners."
"In 
2023, we continued to foster a more diverse and inclusive company culture along the pillars of 
our Diversity & Inclusion strategy do.BETTER, reflecting our commitment to build a company 
where respect and inclusive behavior are second nature."
"The strategy defines twelve Diversity 
and Inclusion (D&I) commitments around four pillars: talent, leadership, customers, and 
partners."
"Talent
We work hard to create an inclusive workplace that provides equal access to opportunities."
"At 
the heart of our vision is a desire to foster a sense of belonging that enables all of our 
employees to thrive."
"In 2023 we updated our hiring, promotion, and development policies to 
ensure more inclusive hiring and to reduce of potential bias."
"We also developed a dedicated 
Disability Inclusion Action plan, including a Disability Inclusion Toolkit, that serves as a 
comprehensive guide for our leaders, teams, and business partners to champion the needs of 
our disabled employees."
"We also continued to improve the accessibility of our physical and 
digital workspace."
"Leadership 
To strategically drive diversity and inclusion across the business, we work with D&I Action 
Plans to build leadership accountability and provide clear D&I goals that create an inclusive 
culture."
"In 2023, we created a D&I Action plan for each business unit."
"We also broadened the 
representation of women within our senior leadership team, achieving 40% women across two 
leadership levels (Management Board and Vice Presidents)."
"We continue to aim for 40%-60% 
women across all top 5 leadership levels."
"18 
Customers
We continue our efforts to champion Diversity & Inclusion, improve accessibility, and offer a 
welcoming space for customers to discover and express themselves."
"We are also building on 
top of our already more accessible digital experience, including better readability, easier 
navigation, and a more intuitive layout of our platform and corporate website."
"We offer 
dedicated training around accessibility and Adaptive Fashion for our engineers, product 
designers, specialists, and private label designers."
"And we celebrated our customers’ diversity 
in our content, campaigns, and storytelling."
"In 2023, we improved the digital customer 
experience for Adaptive Fashion based on customer feedback, for instance by launching 
Adaptive filters that make it easier to browse the assortment."
"We also applied learnings into 
the designs of our new private label collections for Adaptive Fashion in collaboration with the 
disability consultancy All is for All."
"Partners
Over the past year, we have expanded our Diversity & Inclusion-focused collaborations with 
long-standing partners and started working with several more."
"We now carry more than 430 
Adaptive Fashion styles from Zalando’s Private Labels and partner brands including Tommy 
Hilfiger, Nike and our latest addition Friendly Shoes."
"Our inclusive Beauty assortment 
continues to be well received by our customers."
"With the addition of brands such as Andrew 
Fitzsimons and Shake Up to our platform, we set a focus on product and representation for 
LGBTQIA+ in Beauty."
"In 2023, we concluded the do.MORE strategy 
cycle, incorporating our learnings into a new strategy."
"We will also use our unique position as a platform to ensure compliance with EU regulations for 
Zalando and our brands through supporting services."
"We will build on our existing circularity 
investments to target more invest-to-scale opportunities with innovators, leveraging a robust 
investment framework that aligns with our business and sustainability strategies."
"In 2023, we continued to take concrete steps forward to improve the fashion industry for the 
better, including in collaboration with other industry partners."
"In February, STAMM won the 
Zalando Sustainability Award during Copenhagen Fashion week and was recognized for its 
impressive craftsmanship and deep understanding and implementation of more sustainable 
practices."
"2022 winner Nikolaj Storm also launched an exclusive circular design collection for 
Zalando in the month, accompanied by an evaluation report by sustainability consultancy 
Anthesis with transparency across the four stages of the product lifecycle."
"In April, Zalando 
signed the inaugural Pakistan Accord on fire and building safety in the textile and garment 
industry, demonstrating its commitment to the improvement of the safety and well-being of 
workers in the industry."
"In July, Zalando, ABOUT YOU and YOOX NET-A-PORTER expanded 
the ‘FASHION LEAP FOR CLIMATE’ initiative."
"The online learning platform supports brand 
partners in setting climate targets aligned with science to reduce their greenhouse gas 
emissions."
The collaboration is one of our measures to reduce our Scope 3 carbon footprint.
"We also launched ZIGN Studio, an elevated Private Label collection combining fashionable, 
trend-forward designs with wearability, modularity and a circular approach."
"All information, including relevant key performance indicators (KPIs), is provided separately 
for Zalando SE and the Zalando group wherever possible."
"The selection of material topics for our non-financial declaration is based on the materiality 
analysis that we finalized in 2019."
"In order to identify our most material topics, we created a 
shortlist of 18 sustainability topics categorized along three key aspects of our value chain: 
product manufacturing, operations, and consumers."
"We validated and ranked the list based on 
customer and employee surveys, as well as expert interviews."
"The shortlist was assessed in 
terms of the business relevance and impact – both positive and negative – of our business 
model on the corresponding topics."
"Eight topics were identified as material in accordance with 
CSR-RUG."
Relevant information on each of these topics is set out in the table below.

A description of Zalando’s business model is provided in 2.1.1 Business Model of the combined 
management report."
"Sustainability strategy and governance
In October 2019, we launched our do.More sustainability strategy with the goal of creating a 
meaningful transformation of our business."
"Our strategy was connected with the vision to be a 
fashion platform with a net-positive impact for people and the planet."
"Helping us to direct 
resources and prioritize activities was the 2019 materiality assessment."
"In preparation for 
upcoming reporting requirements, we conducted a materiality analysis in the second half of 
2022."
"The results confirmed the current material reporting topics that provide the basis for 
this non-financial declaration 2023."
"As we conclude the do.MORE strategy cycle in the financial year 2023, we are implementing a 
comprehensive double-materiality assessment aligned with the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD) requirements."
"This also marks our transition to a new 
Sustainability Strategy, applicable starting in 2024."
"The double-materiality analysis allows us 
to gain a deeper understanding of our interconnectedness with the environment, prioritize 
sustainability efforts to identify and mitigate risks, and make more informed strategic decisions 
that support sustainable growth."
"Additionally, this assessment will guide the development of 
new sustainability goals that align with our long-term vision and the evolving needs of our 
stakeholders."
"For us, having a net-positive impact means that we do our best to run our organization in a 
way that gives back more to society and the environment than we take."
"We continue to see 
growing expectations from stakeholders confirming the necessity to future-proof our business 
and the increasing requirement to be part of the solution to global challenges."
"—
By 2023, we design our packaging to minimize waste and keep materials in use, 
specifically eliminating single-use plastics."
"Products
—
By 2023, we generate 25% of our GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) with more 
sustainable products."
"—
By 2023, we apply the principles of circularity and extend the life of at least 50 million 
fashion products."
"People
—
By 2023, we have continuously increased our ethical standards and only work with 
partners who align with them."
"In this non-financial declaration, the term “science-based targets” refers to targets in line with the criteria of 
the SBTi."
"—
By 2023, we have supported 10,000 people in the workforce by providing skilling 
opportunities that match future work requirements."
"Key to achieving our goals is a clear governance structure allowing us to integrate 
sustainability into all business units."
"Each goal is managed in a work stream structure with an 
executive sponsor and multifunctional teams across the business."
"In 2023, the Sustainability 
team merged with the Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) team and became part of the Corporate 
Development department, creating a centralized department responsible for developing the 
strategic direction of these two topics as part of the Zalando Group Strategy definition."
"In 
parallel, we are working with relevant business units and their sustainability experts to 
operationalize these strategies."
"We also shifted our approach to internal sustainability reporting, moving from hosting quarterly 
Sustainability Forums to delivering monthly reports (scorecards) directly to Goal Sponsors/
Senior Vice Presidents (SVPs) and the Management Board."
"These scorecards provide an 
overview of progress against our sustainability goals and are jointly reviewed and discussed 
with the Management Board during dedicated quarterly Goal Steering Committee meetings."
"In 
these meetings, Goal Sponsors delve deeper, presenting more detailed information on 
progress towards specific goals."
"By adopting this new format, we aimed to elevate the visibility 
of sustainability initiatives to the Management Board, provide a more accurate representation 
of internal changes and gather more holistic feedback from Zalando's leadership."
"In addition to the Management Board meetings, we continued to work with the Diversity & 
Inclusion and Sustainability Committee of the Supervisory Board throughout 2023."
"This 
committee, which convenes on a half-yearly basis, oversees both the D&I strategy and the 
Sustainability strategy, and provides guidance to the Supervisory Board and its committees in 
their implementation and related reporting."
"More information about the D&I and Sustainability 
Committee of the Supervisory Board is provided in 2.5.5 Supervisory Board
22 of the combined 
management report."
"Our Governance & Risk team identifies, assesses and monitors risks that might impact our 
business performance in a biannual risk cycle."
"The scope of the cycle also includes social and 
environmental risks."
"As a 
result, we currently do not consider any material net risks
23 that are likely to have or will have 
severe negative effects on the material topics."
"We aim to manage potential negative 
implications through the involvement of relevant teams with due diligence processes and 
measures."
23       The net risk reflects the residual risk after all implemented mitigation measures are considered.
"Planet
Driving down greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science
We recognize fashion's ability to bring people and ideas together in ways that foster creativity 
and belonging."
"Our task is to implement these effectively and 
to continue to push forward until we achieve our goals:
—
To align with a 1.5°C pathway, Zalando commits to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions by 80% by 2025 against a 2017 base year."
"Zalando also commits to 
increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity (Scope 2) from 34% in 2017 to 100% 
by 2025."
"—
Zalando commits to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from private label products by 40% 
per million EUR gross profit by 2025 from a 2018 base year."
"Zalando also commits that 
90% of its suppliers (by emissions, including goods and services sold on its platform, 
packaging and last-mile-delivery partners) will have SBTs by 2025."
"Compared to 2022, our total GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) decreased by 10% to 
4,767,366 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (t CO2e)."
"When applying the location-
based method in Scope 2, our total emissions were 4,828,443 metric tons – a 10% decrease 
from 2022."
"We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 78% against a 2017 base year (compared 
to 77% in 2022)."
"This achievement is related to our commitment of switching to renewables, 
a practice that complements our efforts to reduce overall electricity and energy consumption."
"We have procured 100% of our electricity from renewable sources since becoming an RE100 
initiative member in 2020."
Our energy management system is certified by the ISO 50001.
"Gas heating in our logistics centers is the largest source of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
followed by heating in our office and retail spaces."
"Zalando's heating related emissions 
decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower heating demand associated with milder 
external temperatures and ongoing site management improvements."
"In 2023, we completed 
the assessment of options to switch to electricity-powered heating and internally signed off a 
project to replace gas boilers in the office areas of three of our warehouses in Poland."
"This 
project is expected to lead to further emissions reductions in the next few years."
The majority of our emissions stem from Scope 3 sources.
"This includes emissions from 
manufacturing, packaging, and transportation of the products we sell on our platform."
"In 2023, 
Scope 3 emissions accounted for 99.9% of our total emissions."
"To minimize the emissions from products we sell through our retailing and platform 
businesses, we work closely with our brands, logistics and packaging partners to support 
them in emissions reduction target setting in line with the SBTi criteria."
"Using the platform, brands can leverage peer learning opportunities 
and receive step-by-step guidance on measuring emissions and setting targets."
"Brand, 
packaging and last-mile delivery partners accounting for approximately 65% of our 2023 
supplier-related emissions had set SBTs as of the end of 2023."
"In 2022, partners with SBTs 
accounted for 57% of supplier-related emissions."
"The products sold on our platform and via our outlet stores account for 71% of our total 
emissions, with private label products accounting for 6.6% of that total."
"We continue to work 
towards reducing emissions generated by our Zalando Private Label products."
"Our private 
labels have made a consistent effort to incorporate materials that help reduce their carbon 
footprint (read more about this in the Products section of this report)."
"In addition, 2023 
marked the completion of the first year of our Facility Improvement Program (FIP), involving 12 
Tier 1
24 and Tier 2
25 supply chain partners."
"Together, we have developed action plans focused 
on lowering greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency measures and the use of 
renewable energy sources."
"In 2023, private label emissions decreased by 43% per million 
EUR gross profit from a 2018 baseline."
"This progress is mostly driven by Zalando's gross profit 
performance and variations in the number of goods delivered."
"However, we are taking 
important steps to future-proof our carbon accounting for our private label products by 
integrating more granular materials datasets and primary supply chain energy data."
"This allows 
us to account for emissions reductions from lower-carbon materials and supply chain 
decarbonization."
"25  
We define Tier 2 suppliers and factories as those being related to core final material manufacturers and leather tanneries for our shoes and 
accessories products."
"26  
Numbers differ from 2022 reported data."
"This is mainly due to methodological changes applied to our GHG inventory accounting as well as 
improved data quality."
"27       Our Scope 1 emissions include emissions from fuel consumption by company vehicles and from gas and oil consumption for heating as well as 
emissions caused by refrigerant losses."
"28  
Our Scope 2 emissions include emissions from purchased or generated electricity as well as from district heating."
"The location-based value for 
Scope 2 emissions in 2023 is 61,961t CO2e."
"For upstream and downstream transportation and 
distribution, and use of sold products, electricity generation emission factors used do not include ‘Well-to-Tank’ emissions."
"In 2023, the three 
main Scope 3 emissions sources were emissions from manufacturing of products that we purchase and commission, the use of sold products and 
the transportation of products to customers."
"For calculating emissions from products within the category of purchased goods and services, the 
main parameters used are the weight and the material composition of such products."
"However, in 
order to give a representative view of our business impacts, we have optionally included Partner Program products in our footprint."
"Emissions 
from Partner Program products were 1,227,626t CO2e in 2023, 25.75% of total emissions."
"Emissions from Partner Program trim, end-of-life, and 
use phase are not included."
"In addition to the above reduction measures, we have compensated emissions from our own 
operations (Scope 1 and 2) and from packaging
30, upstream transportation, and distribution 
(incl."
"deliveries and returns)
31."
"We have procured carbon removal credits for 420,237t CO2e 
(compared to 419,347 in 2022)."
"Reimagining packaging, minimizing waste
We are committed to move away from a linear take-make-waste system towards a circular 
approach to packaging."
"Our sustainability strategy requires us to find a balance between 
packaging functionality and environmental impact reduction."
"However, finding scalable 
solutions to eliminate single-use plastic poly bags remains our key challenge."
"In addition, the 
industry is facing increasing pressure from expanded sustainability regulations, such as the 
revised and amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (PPWD) under the European 
Green Deal and the Circular Economy Action Plan."
"These regulations, particularly those 
related to data transparency, will have a significant impact on our business operations and 
require us to secure reliable data, not only from our own operations but also from our 
suppliers, to enable informed decision-making."
"In 2023, the Zalando group used more than 52,000t of packaging materials
32 (62,000t in 
2022), 82% of which stem from recycled input materials (86% in 2022)."
"The reduction in 
packaging material usage is mainly attributed to the increased use of paper shipping bags 
compared to cardboard boxes, a measure implemented in 2023 to reduce overall packaging 
weight and waste."
"Due to the higher virgin content required for paper shipping bags to meet 
minimum specifications and product protection standards, this measure also resulted in a 
slight reduction in the proportion of recycled materials used."
"Moreover, 99% of our total packaging was recyclable (a figure that remained consistent with 
2022 levels)
33."
"The remaining 1% results from shipping labels and tape which are not 
recyclable."
"The volume of single-use plastic packaging per item produced for our private 
labels
34 increased by 6% to an average of 5.7g (compared to 5.4g in 2022)."
"We decided to 
increase the share of shipping bags used relative to corrugated boxes, as well as postponing 
the completion of our transition from plastic to paper shipping bags, resulting in a higher 
procurement of plastic shipping bags in the first half of the year."
"The procured amount of 
single-use plastic packaging per item shipped from Zalando group
35 increased by 46% to an 
average of 7.4g (compared to 5.1g in 2022)."
"In our packaging design, we have implemented a redesign of our corrugated and paper bag 
portfolio to minimize weight, translating into reduced waste and material consumption."
"We 
have introduced mandatory contractual requirements in all new and renewed packaging 
supplier contracts, mandating FSC Certification
36 for all virgin fibers and incorporating SBTs 
conditions to include sustainability commitments."
"31  
Emissions from transportation and distribution here comprise emissions from deliveries to customers including returns as well as network 
transportation."
"32 
Packaging considered in the calculation: Cardboard,  low-density Polyethylene-Foil, Paper, PP-Foil, and Polystyrol procured for our own 
operations in Fashion Store, Lounge, IDCs, Private Labels, and Outlets."
"33 
Recyclability refers to packaging material that is suitable for high-quality and mechanical recycling as per the German Packaging Act (VerpackG)."
"34 
In scope is all customer-facing single-use plastic packaging procured by Zalando private labels (our own fashion brands)."
"35 
In scope is all customer-facing single-use plastic packaging procured by Zalando group as an online retailer (excl."
"private labels and items

responsible management of the world's forests via timber certification."
"assessment of nature-related risks in our packaging base to evaluate how to integrate these 
factors into our mid-term strategy."
"While we were unable to meet our goal of fully eliminating single-use plastic from our business 
by the end of 2023, we have made progress in reducing our reliance on this material and have 
continued to explore new approaches to reduce our packaging material and waste."
"Over the 
past year, we have achieved several milestones:
—
Void fill."
"We have eliminated single-used plastic void fill in our Zalando Fashion Store 
shipments."
"Void fill is the plastic matter we insert in boxes, providing stability and 
protection."
"In doing so, we eliminated approximately 153 metric tons of plastic waste in 
2023."
"—
From plastic to paper shipping bags."
"In the Zalando Fashion Store, our transition to paper-
based solutions for our shipping bags will be 100% completed in 2024."
"In 2023, we had 
achieved a reduction of approximately 17% in our use of single-use plastic shipping bags."
"We reduced the impact of approximately 785,000 items by replacing 
the mini and single inlay in our beauty packaging, reducing up to 61% and 4%, 
respectively, of the material weight normally used in this process, and moving from a 
paper mix with adhesive sealing stripes to mono-material cardboard."
"Poly bags provide protection for products during transport from manufacturing 
to fulfillment centers and eventually to retail stores or consumers' homes."
"To reduce their 
environmental impact, we initiated a transition to 100% post-consumer recycled 
content
37 achieving 52% of our procured volume."
"We aim to complete this transition in 
2024."
"We remain committed to keep working on identifying the key levers for improving our 
volumetric efficiency across the portfolio and all packaging layers to reduce and optimize 
packaging material consumption."
"Simultaneously, we are dedicated to developing a robust 
baseline and control systems to provide transparency in our carbon accounting and waste 
generation data."
"On reusable packaging, we are focusing our efforts in closing the loop of 
boxes used for transportation between logistics centers."
"This entails extending the reusability 
of existing boxes, redesigning loading units to fit each process, and continue exploring 
customer-facing alternatives to enable the implementation of reusable packaging and related 
processes."

We define a packaging material as a ""monomaterial"" if it constitutes 95-100% of the packaging by weight."
"In this case, considering that low-
density polyethylene makes up 95% or more of the packaging, with the remaining <5% being additives, we consider it 100% Post-Consumer 
Recycled."
"This definition aligns with the German Packaging Act (VerpackG), which stipulates that monomaterials must consist of at least 95% of 
one main material."
"Products
Enabling change through informed choices
We recognize that our customers want greater transparency regarding the sustainability-
related attributes of products, in order to facilitate informed purchasing decisions that align 
with their sustainability values."
"Additionally, we acknowledge the evolving regulatory 
landscape and policy changes that are raising the minimum requirements for green claims, as 
well as shaping the design of products with environmental stewardship at the forefront."
"These 
developments have presented us with an opportunity to provide our customers with more 
specific and reliable product information, whilst positioning ourselves for future industry shifts."
"In 2017, our Fashion Store initiated a focus on highlighting products with sustainability-related 
attributes to facilitate customer purchasing decisions aligned with their sustainability values."
"Later, in 2019, we set a target to achieve 25% of our GMV by 2023 from products that have 
sustainability-related attributes which are meeting our criteria."
"Since we first started providing 
this information to customers, there has been an increasing demand for traceability, 
transparency, and credibility regarding product sustainability information."
"At Zalando, we 
continuously work on our criteria and customer experience to provide accurate, reliable, 
detailed, and transparent information, and adhere to legal requirements."
"The landscape of sustainability standards and certifications has also undergone significant 
changes in recent years."
"There has been a growth in innovative, next-generation materials, 
textile-to-textile recycled fibers and regeneratively grown fibers."
"Our product sustainability 
criteria have evolved in the past years to reflect these industry changes."
"In 2023, we further 
updated our criteria to align with emerging developments within the broader industry 
landscape."
"As part of these changes, we also increased the specificity of the sustainability-
related attributes we showcase, to meet growing expectations from stakeholders, customers, 
and regulatory bodies."
"Our customer experience is now attribute-based, founded on third party 
certifications such as the Global Organic Textile Standard and other branded materials, such 
as TENCEL™ Lyocell and Infinna™."
"The list of Zalando's accepted standards can be found in 
our Fashion Store."
"However, disclosing this more specific and detailed information in our customer experience 
also requires additional data from our brand partners."
"This includes specific information such 
as the percentage of sustainability related materials used in a product, and the point within the 
supply chain at which the final certification becomes valid."
"Upon collecting this information 
from our partners, we conduct automatic validation procedures through our internal systems 
to determine whether a product is eligible to be highlighted in our customer experience."
"Obtaining such information requires significant time and effort from our partners and their 
supply chains."
"After an integration period for our partners, we also removed the sustainability 
related attributes for products that did not adhere to the updated criteria."
"Together this has 
resulted in a reduced assortment of products labeled with sustainability related attributes in 
2023."

Zalando SE
ANNUAL REPORT 2023
As of December 31, 2023, we offered our customers more than 108,000 products with 
sustainability-related attributes (compared to over 180,000 in 2022)."
"These products 
contributed to 10.5% of our GMV (compared to 17% in 2022)."
"38 Additionally, around 43% of 
our Fashion Store customers made the decision to buy at least one product with a 
sustainability-related attribute, down from 54% in 2022 (the decrease is due to changes in 
data collection and in the requirements to receive a valid sustainability attribute)."
"39 The 
reduction of our assortment of products with sustainability-related attributes in 2023 meant 
that we did not achieve our 25% GMV goal as set out in our do.MORE strategy."
"Nevertheless, 
we have greatly enhanced the criteria for identifying and showcasing articles with 
sustainability-related attributes and have therefore improved the data quality of these 
products."
"This results in more specific and accurate information provided in our customer 
experience."
"Furthermore, we observed an increase in our assortment of products with 
sustainability-related attributes during the second half of 2023, and we are optimistic that this 
positive trend will continue."
"Extending the life of fashion
We are on a journey to a more circular fashion industry, recognizing that establishing a circular 
ecosystem will require ongoing efforts."
"The circular economy has faced some hurdles in 2023, 
slowing its advancement across industries
40."
"At Zalando, we can relate to both the challenges and the opportunities that a circular economy 
can bring."
"As we come to the end of our do.MORE strategy, it gives us an opportunity to 
reflect on our progress, identify learnings, and refine our approach for future advancement."
"Throughout 2023, we continued to make progress towards our do.MORE goal to extend the 
life of 50 million items by 2023, all while developing and implementing our comprehensive 
circularity strategy."
"This strategy centers on four key pillars: design and manufacturing, use, 
reuse, and closing the loop."
"While we have made strides towards our goal in 2023, it is clear that this target was highly 
ambitious and, as we acknowledged previously, it was not achieved."
"Since 2020, we were able 
to extend the life of 6.3 million fashion items, with an increase of 2.6 million items in 2023."
"While we are aware that this falls short of our target, we are encouraged by the progress we 
have made over the past three years, encompassing the launch of a Circularity Strategy, along 
with the accumulation of valuable learnings and insights that can shape our approach moving 
forward."
"Design and manufacture: In 2023, Zalando continued to focus on incorporating our circular 
design criteria, launched on Earth Day 2022, to a wider range of items and styles
41."
"Since 
establishing our goal, private labels designed and produced approximately 2.5 million items in 
line with the circular design principles."
"We also launched ZIGN Studio, a new Private Label 
collection focused on premium quality and material innovation."
"Textile-to-textile recycling is also in its early stages, with limited facilities in operation."
"41 
Styles refers to Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), which represent unique identifiers for specific product variations, including style and color."
"For 
instance, a single t-shirt design in one color would have one SKU."
"If the same design is available in three colors, each color would correspond to a 
separate SKU, resulting in three SKUs in total."
"in men’s and women’s textiles, footwear and accessories."
"Material innovations include 
recycled materials, such as Naia renew, and improved manufacturing processes."
"Private Label 
also continued in-person training on circular design for production teams, delivering it to 
multiple internal stakeholders in collaboration with circular.fashion."
"Use: In 2023, we decided to pause our Care and Repair services pilot in Berlin."
"Launched in 
partnership with Save Your Wardrobe in October 2021, the pilot has provided us with a lot of 
insights on the care and repair business model, notably on the logistical operations, customer 
booking journey and customer demand."
"Our decision to scale-down the pilot was based on 
challenges around customer convenience of the online model and data integration that would 
better enable us to support our customers."
"We continue to share our learnings internally and 
with the industry to support progress on this topic."
"Reuse: The Pre-owned Category continues to be available in 13 markets, and we have 
established Pre-owned corners in ten outlet stores across Germany."
"We offer a selection of 
about 270,000 items in the pre-owned area with the same level of service as for new products 
- free delivery and free returns."
"Closing the loop: To scale the circular economy, we recognize that a significant amount of 
investment will be required to support the necessary infrastructure and technology to enable 
textile-to-textile recycling at scale."
"In 2023, we built on our investments in textile recyclers - 
Ambercycle and Circ - in a couple of key ways."
"We made follow-on investments in Ambercycle 
to support the construction of their facilities."
"We are actively engaged in discussions for 
offtake agreements with Ambercycle and Infinited Fiber Company as we seek to provide 
innovators with a reliable demand forecast that can support their scaling and fundraising 
efforts."
"Beyond these investments, we have continued our partnerships to gain a better 
understanding of footwear recycling through our involvement in key initiatives with 
FastFeetGrinded, in collaboration with Fashion for Good, and Reshoes, led by CETIA
42."
"Additionally, it is important to highlight that sales returns are managed separately from our 
circularity strategy, even though both share the common goal of minimizing waste and 
maximizing product lifespan."
"Zalando adheres to its duty of care under the German Circular 
Economy Law (KrWG) in managing product returns."
"All returned products, irrespective of their 
market value, undergo a comprehensive inspection and sorting procedure."
"Accordingly, they 
are immediately sent to the center’s outbound area where they are compiled for transport to 
one of our customer-facing logistics centers
43."
"If the fashion item was classified as perfect in 
the first place, or if the refurbishment of minor defects was successful, it is sent to the 
outbound area."
"The checked items are not shipped directly from the return centers for the 
next customer order."
"Instead, they are first consolidated and brought back in bulk to one of 
the 12 logistics centers within our network from where they start their journey to our 
customers again."
"We decide where to store the items based on factors such as the likelihood 
of resale in the region or market."
"43  
The precise storage location of these items is determined based on factors such as the anticipated demand for resale in the respective region or 
market."

Continuously increasing our ethical standards
An important aspect of our sustainability challenge involves maintaining high ethical 
standards, both in our own operations and those of our partners around the world."
"We want 
to guide positive action on issues such as low pay, inequality, long working hours, and working 
conditions."
"To move towards solutions, we continue to maintain a due diligence process, both 
in our own operations and across our supply chain."
"We have aligned our efforts with the 
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act
44, which defines a range of requirements for 
responsible supply chain management."
"Our commitment in this area has not had a quantifiable KPI attached to it, making it more 
difficult to measure success."
"While we can state that our ethical standards have undergone 
continuous review and refinement since 2019, and our established due diligence system 
supports us in preventing, identifying, managing, and remediating potential violations of our 
standards, this endeavor will remain an ongoing process."
"Our human rights due diligence program supports our efforts, helping us identify and act on 
risks in our operations, supply chains, and business partnerships."
"The governance of our due 
diligence program is grounded in our Code of Conduct and our Policy Statement on Zalando’s 
Human Rights Strategy, which together set out principles we strive to attain."
"It is implemented 
through four cyclical steps:
1."
"Analyze: The first step in the cycle is an analysis of our direct suppliers’ exposure to human 
rights risks
45 and, to a limited extent, environmental risks, using a holistic risk assessment 
methodology for all direct suppliers based on their location, industry, and our spend with them."
"Prioritize: By using the risk profiles created through the analysis of direct suppliers 
(categorized as very high, high, medium, or low risk), we enhance generic risk information with 
internal findings and expertise to prioritize plans for prevention, remediation, and risk 
management."
"Manage: We deploy a comprehensive, supplier-focused risk management approach that 
operates on two fronts: proactive risk prevention and reactive risk identification and mitigation."
"–
Prevent: Based on the assessed and prioritized risks, we develop further preventive 
measures in the individual business units where necessary to mitigate specific risks."

The German Supply Chain Act (SCA) obliges companies to respect human rights by implementing defined due diligence obligations."
"It applies to 
an enterprise’s own business area, to the actions of a contractual partner (direct supplier) and – to a limited extent – to the actions of other 
(indirect) suppliers."
"Our Code of Conduct serves as the standard foundation for contractual relations with 
Zalando."
"The Code sets out binding principles for ethical, fair, and sustainable 
practices, and it is embedded in our contracts with business partners."
"To monitor the 
alignment of our business relations with our ethical standards, we implemented a 
tracking mechanism to evaluate the implementation status within the company’s 
contractual landscape."
"We follow up on potential violations of our ethical standards 
and have related consequence management in place."
"Through social audits, we continued to review compliance of our direct suppliers and 
Tier 1 suppliers."
"Non-compliance findings are classified as minor, major, critical and zero tolerance, 
leading to a rating and potential Corrective Action Plan."
"In 2023, we evaluated 213 
audit reports (302 in 2022) from private label Tier 1 suppliers and declined to 
onboard 5 factories or suppliers (4 in 2022) due to their failure to meet audit 
requirements."
"–
Remediate: When potential breaches are identified through one of our established 
channels, we investigate and respond to them in a systematic way."
"To enhance our grievance mechanism and better serve the needs of potential 
reporters within our supply chain, we have introduced a new tool called SpeakUp."
"This tool expands our language, reporting, and translation capabilities, making it 
easier for individuals to report potential supply chain-related incidents compared to 
our existing Whistleblowing Tool."
"SpeakUp is available in 42 languages and 
accessible via web, app, or hotline."
"It is offered to any external party, with a 
particular focus on workers in our supply chain."
"Our remediation process provides internal teams with a standardized way to 
investigate and address violations of our Code of Conduct or other ethical standards."
"If the partner fails to engage, we will pause and eventually end the relationship."
"Report: Reporting for the cycle is conducted in adherence to the German Supply Chain Due 
Diligence Act and the guidance of the competent authority (BAFA)."
"The first report will be 
submitted within the legally mandated time frame for 2024."
"This 
review enabled us to gain even more clarity on risky areas in our business relationships, 
prioritize preventive measures and manage risks in (future) interactions, as well as in industry-
wide collaborations."
"Additionally, we further integrated operational responsibility for human 
rights due diligence into the business by transferring it from the central sustainability function 
to the Compliance team to be further synchronized with company-wide governance."
"To address identified sector-level risks, we also collaborate with other retailers, industry 
players, and business partners, participate in industry initiatives, and engage with external 
stakeholders, including government bodies and NGOs."
"Preparing the workforce for the future
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that up to 1 
billion people need to be reskilled by 2030 to meet demand for new skills."
"46 In 2023, we saw a 
rising demand for expertise in areas such as data science, storytelling, leading through 
change, feedback transparency and resilience."
"To meet this challenge, we set ourselves the 
following goal: By 2023, we have supported 10,000 people in the workforce by providing 
skilling opportunities that match future work requirements."
"The scope of the goal is split 
between our own workforce, the workforce in our private label supply chain and in our brand 
partner supply chains."
"Since 2020, 9,925 people
47 received skilling training (4,714 in 2023, of which 506 in Zalando 
SE)."
"To support our employees and those working in our supply chain in keeping pace with 
shifting workplace demands, we offer a range of upskilling and reskilling opportunities."
"Upskilling means providing additional skills to perform a role where the requirements will 
change."
"Reskilling, on the other hand, entails acquiring new skills."
"To prepare Zalando’s 
employees, we foster learning opportunities focused on topics including new 
technologies, leading hybrid teams, and vital soft skills such as inclusivity and empathy."
"By the end of 2023, we delivered 289 courses, such as Giving and Receiving Effective 
Feedback, Supporting Career Development, and Figma Level-Up Training."
"—
Skilling opportunities linked to changing business needs: Following our 2022 skilling 
needs analysis, which identified the evolving needs of our business in the short- and 
medium term, we implemented various programs across technology, central and 
operations functions."
"47  
Includes Zalando SE and Zalando group employees and supply chain workers in private labels."
"certification (warehouse logistics specialist), as well as to boost language skills in German 
and English; financial upskilling covering topics such as external financial reporting."
"Additionally, we continued to offer dedicated career development programs."
"—
Skilling opportunities linked to our upstream supply chain: In 2023, we scaled our 
upskilling program to encompass our upstream supply chain, collaborating with our 
business partners, Shimmy Technologies and BSR’s RISE - HERproject™, in Bangladesh."
"We trained around 3,904 people in 4 factories in digital literacy, efficiency training, 
gender equality, financial literacy, workplace communication, and health and well-being."
"Although we did not achieve our full target, we are encouraged by the progress made and 
believe that the programs and structures we have established around this commitment provide 
a solid foundation for continued efforts."
"Humanitarian efforts: In 2023, we donated over 154,000 Zalando items valued at 
approximately EUR 450,000 to organizations supporting people in need, with a strong focus 
on Ukraine, Turkey, and Syria."
"In addition, we supported disaster relief efforts and sought to 
promote constructive improvement through strategic partnerships."
"Overall, we donated around 
EUR 700,000 in 2023 to a diverse range of local and global initiatives."
"We made direct 
contributions to SOS Children’s Villages worldwide, humedica or Kinnings Foundation and 
matched donations from Zalando employees who were organizing bake sales to support global 
humanitarian efforts."
"This funding has enabled the 
program to gain traction through the organization of numerous activities at the local, regional, 
national, and EU levels."
"Additionally, a public mobilization campaign has been launched, 
caregivers have received education, and local social plans have been developed based on the 
specific needs of families and children."
Collaborations: Creating the next generation of fashion designers.
"We want to provide 
designers with the knowledge, skills, and innovative mindset to champion sustainable and 
transformative practices within the industry."
"By fostering their design expertise in the 
principles of Circularity and Sustainability, digital product development, and virtual fashion 
concepts, we aspire to contribute to a shift towards a more responsible and innovative fashion 
industry."
"Our 2023 Design Academy project focused on designer luxury, with an 
emphasis on more circular designs, quality, and longevity."
"The project aimed to empower 
young design talents, fostering their skills and equipping them with design practices that 
benefit both people and the planet."
"In parallel, Zalando has been working with the Graduate Fashion Foundation to develop a 
circularity-focused course module to support the education of design students at university 
level."
"This module was initially pilot tested with design students at Manchester Metropolitan 
University (MMU) in September 2023."
"The initiative sought to equip students at an early stage 
with the necessary knowledge and critical thinking skills to champion circularity and 
sustainability principles within the fashion industry."
Community engagement/volunteering.
Helping others is part of our Zalando core values.
"Two 
days (16 hours) each year, our employees are offered the opportunity to engage in community 
work."
"We actively partner with NGOs, brand and business partners, who drive positive change."
"Since 2015, Zalando has partnered with vostel.de, a leading corporate volunteering 
organization, to facilitate these engagement opportunities."
"In 2023, 535 Zalando employees supported 66 projects through 4,281 hours of volunteering."
"A significant focus was directed towards supporting the Berlin Special Olympics, an initiative 
aligned with our commitment to diversity and inclusion."
"Additionally, more than 100 Zalando 
employees volunteered in filling and decorating more than 800 gift bags for children living in 
refugee shelters."
"Finally, we reaffirmed our commitment to the local Berlin community by sponsoring the 
Ukrainian Pop-Up Charity Market SKRYNYA, organized by Zalando volunteers, the European 
Academy Berlin, and many individuals and friends of Ukraine."
"The SKRYNYA sponsorship 
supports Ukrainian creatives, including fashion, jewelry, and home brands."
"The event took 
place in February and December, attracting a significant audience of over 5,500 attendees."
"More than 40 fashion, jewelry, and home decorations brands from Ukraine participated, raising 
over EUR 30,000 for Ukrainian NGOs."
"It brings together the various players in the sustainable fashion industry and enables knowledge transfer within our 
community."
"As an insider, VORN connects all actors in an interdisciplinary way and enables access to advanced programs and knowledge."
"Reporting on the EU Taxonomy Regulation
With the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth published in 2018, the European 
Commission set the objective to redirect capital flows towards sustainable investment."
"In this 
context, a standardized classification system – the EU Taxonomy – was established to define 
criteria classifying economic activities as being environmentally sustainable."
"Companies 
subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (Directive 2014/95/EU) are required to report 
in line with the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852)."
"Therefore, companies 
have to extend their non-financial disclosures by reporting on how and to what extent the 
company’s activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally 
sustainable."
"According to Article 8 of the regulation, reporting companies have to disclose the proportion 
of the company’s turnover, capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenditure (opex) for 
both Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities."
"In order to be deemed as 
Taxonomy-aligned, a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity has to fulfill the following criteria as 
defined in Article 3 of the regulation."
"We started reporting according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the corresponding 
Delegated Acts back in 2021."
"In 2022, reporting 
was expanded also to assess Taxonomy alignment of activities within the Zalando group."
"We assessed Annex I and Annex II that amend the list of economic 
activities regarding the first two environmental objectives as well as related technical 
screening and do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria."
"Zalando neither performs one of the new 
activities nor is Zalando affected by the changes to the technical screening criteria."
"According to the adoption timeline, for fiscal year 2023, Zalando is

required to assess the eligibility of the new activities."
"As a result, Zalando did not identify any 
significant activity under the new regulations."
"The amendments to the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation also impacted some of the disclosure requirements stated in the Delegated Acts."
"The changes, that we adopted inside the current reporting, relate to the new table format to 
outline reporting KPIs."
"References to the line items of the consolidated financial statements 
were already included in prior years’ reporting."
"Our approach of assessing economic activities under the EU Taxonomy Regulation for fiscal 
year 2023 is explained in more detail below."
"Disclosures related to the remaining four environmental 
objectives are therefore limited to the eligibility assessment in this year’s reporting."
"We 
assessed the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214, amending Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178."
"The changes include additional economic activities related to the energy sector, and they 
modify the technical screening criteria as regards specific public disclosures for those 
economic activities."
None of these changes affect our Group.
"We have reviewed our prior years’ assessment of economic activities as defined in Annex I and 
Annex II of the Climate Delegated Act."
"This review has not resulted in a change of our 
previously identified material Taxonomy-eligible economic activities, hence we still only report 
on capex related to the leasing of our buildings and corresponding opex (economic activity 7.7 
listed in Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act)."
"We have also calculated total value of opex 
which includes non-capitalized development costs, costs for short-term leases, costs for 
maintenance and repair as well as costs of day-to-day-servicing of assets."
"In fiscal year 2023, 
Zalando has expanded the number of its leased buildings which led to additions to right-of-use 
assets of EUR 213.5m."
"This is material from the group’s perspective, and should therefore be 
reported as Taxonomy-eligible capex."
"The additions are mainly related to a new office building 
in Germany as well as our new fulfillment centers in Germany and Poland."
"Additions to right-of-use assets of EUR 231.2m as disclosed in the notes also include EUR 
17.7m related to re-measurements that are not included in total capex."
"Total capex for fiscal 
year 2023 therefore amounts to EUR 507.3m."
"This led to a proportion of Taxonomy-eligible 
capex of 42.1%."
"For our leased buildings we have calculated opex of EUR 12.5m for fiscal year 2023 which is 
related to maintenance and repair as well as day-to-day servicing of those assets."
"Besides for economic activity 7.7, we have not identified any other material capex, opex or 
Taxonomy-related turnover."
"Zalando has allocated all of the calculated capex and opex to the environmental objective of 
climate change mitigation."
"In addition, only one economic activity was identified for which 
capex and opex were calculated."
This avoided any double counting.
"Furthermore, we assessed which proportion of our capex qualifies as environmentally 
sustainable and is therefore reported as capex related to Taxonomy-aligned economic 
activities."
"This assessment was based on the criteria laid down in Article 3 of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation."
"Because our capex is only related to the purchase of output, we do not 
have all the necessary information to perform the assessment."
"As a result, we were not able to 
qualify our Taxonomy-eligible capex related to the leasing of our buildings as Taxonomy-
aligned capex for fiscal year 2023."
This correspondingly also applies to related opex.
"Further, 
because we did not identify any Taxonomy-eligible turnover, we hence could not calculate any 
Taxonomy-aligned turnover."
"An additional Delegated Act to the Taxonomy Regulation was published in 2023, which set out 
the technical screening and do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria for the four remaining non-
climate related environmental objectives."
"We analyzed the Environmental Delegated Act and 
its Annexes."
For fiscal year 2023 we did not find any material Taxonomy-eligible activity.
"Outlook on future reporting
Our reporting approach for fiscal year 2023 reflects the current legislative status of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation."
"In this third reporting year, we acknowledge that the European 
Commission is progressing towards the standardization of the reporting framework, and we 
are already adapting our approach accordingly."
"For the next year’s reporting, Zalando will be 
for the first time required to comply with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, that 
supports companies to integrate EU Taxonomy disclosures into a comprehensive 
Sustainability Statement."
"We continue monitoring further developments of the regulation and 
will respond to additional specifications of the regulation in coming reporting periods."

"Thereby, we remain focused on delivering improved profitability and at the same

"These major key performance indicators (KPIs) are 
derived from the guidance of our Management Board and the group planning."
"Our group 
planning constantly monitors our financial KPIs and performs a monthly comparison with our 
budget."
"Our major KPIs for the group performance management are GMV, revenue, adjusted 
EBIT (margin) and capex."
"The Management Board steers the company at a consolidated group 
level as well as on segment level."
"GMV is the value of all merchandise sold to customers after 
cancellations and returns and including VAT."
"GMV excludes, in contrast to the KPI revenue, 
the B2B revenue (e.g."
"Partner Program commission, ZMS, ZFS fees or our recently launched 
ZEOS Fulfillment) and non-product B2C revenue (e.g."
"service charges like express delivery 
fees or Zalando Plus subscription fees)."
"Whereas GMV is recorded at the time of the customer 
order, revenue is recorded at the point in time when control over the promised goods and 
services is transferred."
"In contrast to our EBIT, the adjusted EBIT is EBIT before equity-settled 
share-based compensation, restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses and significant 
non-operating one-time effects."
"Capex is defined as the sum of the payments for investments 
in fixed assets and intangible assets excluding payments for the acquisition of companies."
"Moreover, the net working capital consists of inventories and trade and other receivables less 
trade payables and similar liabilities."
"In addition to these financial indicators, we also use a range of further key performance 
indicators to manage our business."
"—
Active customers: Active customers is defined as the number of customers who have 
placed at least one order in the last twelve months during the reporting period, 
irrespective of returns."
"The number of customers who have completely canceled their 
orders are excluded."
"—
Number of orders: These are the number of orders placed by customers during the 
reporting period, irrespective of cancellations or returns."
"An order is counted on the day 
the customer places the order."
"The number of orders placed may differ from the number 
of orders delivered because the orders at the end of the reporting period may still be in 
transit or may have been canceled."
"—
Average GMV per active customer: We define the average GMV per active customer 
as the average value of all merchandise sold to active customers after cancellations and 
returns and including VAT in the last twelve months of the reporting period."
"—
Average orders per active customer: This is the number of orders placed by active 
customers during the last twelve months of the reporting period, divided by the number 
of active customers."
"—
Average basket size: We define the average basket size as the GMV after cancellations 
and returns and including VAT, divided by the number of orders in the last twelve months 
of the reporting period."
"2.1.6
Research and development
We develop key software components of our platform internally."
"The developments relate to a 
structured, labor-intensive software development process aimed at adding new functionalities 
and/or enhancing the existing system landscape by significant system functionalities along 
the entire value and process chain."
"This ensures that our technology platform supports the 
company strategy and is aligned with the operating processes and systems."
"Development work 
at Zalando is performed by teams of developers that are organized by the respective function 
or business unit, for example Fashion Store, including Zalando Plus, Zalando Fulfillment 
Solutions and Partner Program, Payment Services, Zalando Marketing Services and Offprice."
"In 2023, we recognized capitalizable development costs of EUR 74.5m (prior year: 
EUR 76.6m), of which EUR 6.5m relate to assets under development (prior year: 
EUR 36.3m)."
"We continue investing in our technology platform, including ongoing 
improvements and continued innovation of existing products and processes in pursuit 
of our vision to build the ecosystem of fashion and lifestyle e-commerce."
"Zalando does not operate a research and development department in the sense of an 
industrial company."
"Our software development departments optimize the existing offers 
and work on establishing innovative products in the market."
"Accordingly, research has a 
subordinate role and consequently research costs were immaterial."
"Inflation came 
down towards the end of 2023 but growth remains subdued as the tightening of monetary 
policy to tackle inflation is taking effect."
"Furthermore, the economic environment continues to 
be characterized by weak economic growth and lower business and consumer confidence
49."
"Global GDP has proved to be resilient in the context of the negative shocks from Russia’s war 
against Ukraine and the sharp tightening of monetary policy as central banks responded to 
above-target inflation."
"In the first half of 2023, the global economy expanded better than 
expected."
"However, growth has slowed down during the second half of 2023 in many 
advanced economies, especially in Europe, where bank finance plays a significant role and 
where the impact on incomes from increased energy costs has been more pronounced."
"In 
2023, the global GDP growth was recorded at 2.9%, with a forecast of a slight reduction to 
2.7% in 2024."
"For the Euro Area, the GDP growth rate was lower at 0.6% in 2023, with 
expectations of a modest increase to 0.9% in 2024, as per the OECD's data
50."
"Consumer price inflation in the Euro Area was confirmed at 2.9% year-on-year in December, 
2023."
"Inflation declined since its peak of 10.6% in October, 2022."
"Meanwhile, consumer 
confidence in the Euro Area has shown a steady improvement, moving from -20.7 points at the 
year's start to -15.0 points by year-end."
"Despite this progress, it remains below the long-term 
average of -11.6 recorded since 2000
51."
"In addition to these macroeconomic factors weighing on the fashion industry, the eased 
pandemic environment has a noticeable impact on the e-commerce sector as consumer 
demand from online to offline channels rebalanced towards their pre-pandemic levels."
"As a result, German fashion e-commerce sales fell by -13.3 percent in 2023 year-on-year in 
nominal terms
52."
"After a 
challenging year 2022, we continued to operate in a difficult market environment in 2023, 
thereby adapting our business to the volatile environment."
"As part of our plan, we reduced our 
wholesale order volume and were more selective with the curation of our assortment."
"At the same 
time, we continued to selectively invest into strategic areas of our business along strategic 
dimensions: customer, partners as well as people and planet."
"As a result, we closed 2023 with a GMV decline of 1.1% year-on-year to EUR 14.6bn (prior 
year: EUR 14.8bn)."
"The group recorded revenue of EUR 10.1bn (prior year: EUR 10.3bn), with a 
decline of 1.9% compared to 2022."
"In 2023, we significantly improved adjusted EBIT, nearly 
doubling it to EUR 349.9m (prior year: EUR 184.6m), that corresponds to an improved margin 
of 3.5% (prior year: 1.8%)."
"In an unfavorable market environment characterized by subdued consumer sentiment, our 
customer base declined by 3.3% year-on-year to 49.6m active customers at the end of 2023 
(prior year: 51.2m)."
"The decrease in active customers was partly offset by an increase of 
average GMV per active customer by 2.3% to EUR 295.2."
"This development was driven by an 
increase of the average basket size after returns by 5.5% more than offsetting the decline in 
average orders per active customers (2023 at 4.9 vs."
Our brand partnerships are the key to unlocking a world of possibilities for our customers.
"This 
is why our platform strategy has always been an integral part of our business strategy."
"We aim 
to facilitate the access of retailers and brands to our platform through a combination of our 
Wholesale and Partner Business."
"In 2023, we continued to enhance data and analytics 
capabilities to provide better assistance in making informed assortment and merchandising 
decisions."
"We also implemented changes to the compensation structure for partners to better 
support our assortment strategy."
"Our key add-on service to the Partner Program, Zalando 
Fulfillment Solutions (ZFS), facilitates the transport of partners' goods to customers in our 
European markets in a manner that prioritizes customer satisfaction and cost-effectiveness."
"Additionally, Zalando Marketing Services (ZMS), our marketing division, creates meaningful 
connections between brands and consumers through engaging ad formats."
"Given the challenging trading environment, we have been more decisive in our wholesale 
buying."
"Our wholesale business contributed 61% of Zalando Fashion Store GMV by the final 
quarter of 2023 (vs."
"Our brand and retail partners have experienced ongoing 
growth in our Partner Business."
"This is evidenced by the solid increase in the Partner Business 
GMV in 2023."
"As a result, the Partner Business GMV accounted for 39% of the total GMV of 
the Fashion Store (vs."
36% in 2022) in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Fulfillment Solutions increased to 62% of all items shipped through the Partner Program (vs."
"Additionally, Zalando Marketing Services revenue remained roughly stable at 
2% of our Fashion Store GMV by the end of the year, as partners are spending more 
cautiously in the current market environment."
"In 2023, we worked on finalizing our efforts towards the commitments of our do.MORE 
sustainability strategy across the three pillars planet, products and people."
"We continued our 
work to cut Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions."
"To scale our efforts, we expanded the 
FASHION LEAP FOR CLIMATE initiative together with ABOUT YOU and YOOX NET-A-
PORTER to further brand partners."
"The online learning platform supports brand partners in 
setting climate targets aligned with science to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions."
"To 
reduce carbon emissions resulting from our private label brands, we switched from 
conventional to lower-impact materials."
"To empower our customers to make informed and responsible purchasing decisions and to 
meet emerging regulatory requirements, we focused on further developing the quality of data 
for our sustainability-related products in 2023."
"We also took further steps to apply circular 
economy principles in the close-the-loop-stage, building on our previous investment in the 
textile recycler Ambercycle."
"The follow-on investments will help Ambercycle building its 
facilities."
"It will also provide access to recycled materials for our private label production and 
brands."
"In 2023, we completed the do.MORE strategy cycle, in which we made significant progress on 
carbon reduction, human rights and circularity."
"However, we did not fully meet our targets, 
many of which were due to be met by the end of 2023."
"While we fell short of our goals, we 
learned a lot about ourselves, our business and our industry that we will take forward."
"Our 
progress, challenges, and learnings over the past four years and the insights it brought have 
helped us map out the next steps in our journey as we work to further empower our 
organization and our partners to drive change in our industry and beyond."
"It is our vision to be welcoming to everyone and we strive to be inclusive by design, bringing to 
life the diversity of our talents, leaders, customers and partners."
"With our Diversity and 
Inclusion (D&I) strategy, do.BETTER, we set twelve D&I commitments around these four pillars 
and work towards these commitments."
"We improved the digital customer experience for 
Adaptive Fashion, for instance by introducing Adaptive Filters that make it easier to browse 
and assess the assortment, based on customer feedback since the launch last year."
"To become the e-commerce channel of choice for underrepresented 
partners, we also added new black-owned brands such as Ahluwalia and Yaura in 2023."
"GMV decreased by 1.1% with revenues following that trend 
coming in 1.9% lower on a yearly comparison."
"The strong development of Zalando’s Partner 
Business as well as a good performance in Lounge by Zalando, especially in the first half of 
2023 could not fully compensate this trend."
"Despite a weak consumer environment in 2023 being reflected in our GMV and revenue 
development, we managed to successfully improve profitability which is recorded in a 
significant increase in adjusted EBIT to EUR 349.9m (prior year: EUR 184.6m) and adjusted 
EBIT margin to 3.5% (prior year: 1.8%)."
"The full year development was characterized by an 
ongoing promotional environment, based on elevated inventory levels across the industry and 
price sensitive consumers, which put pressure on our gross margins."
"Efficiency gains in 
fulfillment and lower spend in marketing more than offset the gross margin decline."
"Net 
income came out at EUR 83.0m (prior year: EUR 16.8m)."
"*) 
GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) is defined as the value of all merchandise sold to customers after cancellations and returns and including VAT, 
dynamically reported."
It does not include B2B revenues (e.g.
"Partner Program commission, Zalando Marketing Services or Zalando Fulfillment 
Solutions) and other B2C revenues (e.g."
service charges like express delivery fees); these are included in revenue only.
"GMV is recorded based 
on the time of the customer order."
Due to the dynamically reporting of GMV prior year figures may deviate from former published reports.
**) Calculated based on the last twelve months (LTM).
"Revenue 
was down 1.9% to EUR 10,143.1m (prior year: EUR 10,344.8m)."
"In 2023, we continued to make progress in the transition to a platform model."
"Our Partner 
Business GMV (incl."
Partner Program and Connected Retail) grew by 12%.
"In Q4 2023, 39% 
of our Fashion Store GMV is stemming from our Partner Business (incl."
"Partner Program and 
Connected Retail) compared to 36% in Q4 2022."
"The difference between GMV and revenue 
development is inherent in our Partner Business model where selling prices are fully reflected 
in the GMV metric, while revenue only includes the commission income on the selling price."
"Furthermore, revenue from our platform services like Zalando Fulfillment Solutions (ZFS) and 
Zalando Marketing Services (ZMS) are considered in revenue but not in GMV."
"Along with that, we continue to see customers adopting multiple propositions, defined as 
Fashion, Beauty, Designer, Lounge by Zalando and Pre-owned."
"As of December 31, 2023, 
the group had 49.6 million active customers compared to 51.2 million active customers as of 
December 31, 2022, corresponding to a decrease of 3.3%."
"This trend can be explained by 
lower new customer acquisition given the subdued demand environment."
"Overall GMV development was driven by the decline in number of active customers, being 
partly offset by increased spending per customer as the average GMV per active customer 
increased by 2.3% to EUR 295.2 on the back of a 5.5% higher basket size per order."
"Average 
basket size in 2023 is at EUR 59.8, thereby overcompensating the decline in average order 
per active customer to 4.9 (-3.1% compared to 2022)."

relate to the reshaping program launched at the beginning of 2023."
"54 In addition, one-time 
effects of EUR 24.2m mainly stem from the impairment of lease assets that are no longer 
planned to be used for our own business."
"The adjusted EBIT margin improved to 3.5% 
(prior year: 1.8%)."
"Cost of sales decreased by 1.2% year-on-year from EUR 6,289.3m to EUR 6,212.7m."
"The 
improvement in cost of sales could not offset the fall in revenue."
"Furthermore, we effectively 
managed any potential overstock risk albeit at the cost of gross margin."
"Gross margin declined 
to 38.7% year-on-year (prior year: 39.2%)."
"Reasons for the decline were a promotional 
environment across the industry with subdued demand throughout the year."
"The fulfillment cost ratio as a percentage of revenue improved by 2.0 percentage points 
from 26.2% in 2022 to 24.2% in 2023."
"The decline was driven by favourable order 
economics, the scaling of our partner business with a growing ZFS share as well as continued 
efficiency measures like order bundling."
"Marketing spend decreased by EUR 42.0m to EUR 752.5m, reflecting a decline in marketing 
costs relative to revenues of 0.3 percentage points to 7.4%."
"The decrease is mainly the result 
of lower marketing investments as well as a strong growth in Offprice in the first half of 2023."
"Administrative expenses stayed almost flat with EUR 480.4m in 2022 and EUR 490.8m in 
2023."
"Administrative expenses in proportion to revenue remained relatively stable at 4.8% up 
0.2 percentage points compared to the prior year."
"Other operating expenses increased by EUR 43.4m to EUR 58.5m primarily due to the 
reshaping program."
"The related costs amount to EUR 32.4m and comprise expenses for 
severance and garden leave payments as well as consulting fees."
"Our financial result of EUR -38.0m in 2023 (prior year: EUR -42.2m) mainly comprised interest 
and similar expenses of EUR 85.6m (prior year: EUR 62.7m) and interest and similar income of 
EUR 46.5m (prior year: EUR 8.6m)."
"The changes compared to prior year were mainly due to 
the rise in Euro interest rates in 2023, which influenced the interest and similar expenses from 
financing instruments as well as the interest income from money markets fund and deposits."
"The income taxes of EUR -69.9m (prior year: EUR -22.0m) comprised current taxes of 
EUR -78.5m (prior year: EUR -22.0m) with an EBT of EUR 152.9m (prior year: EUR 38.8m) and 
deferred tax of EUR 8.5m (prior year: EUR 0.0m)."
"The tax rate of our group was essentially 
affected by non-deductible expenses from shared-based payment programs."
"The net income 
of our group was EUR 83.0m (prior year: EUR 16.8m)."

"We observed a post-pandemic slowdown of fashion online spend continue as 
consumers rebalanced their spend towards brick and mortar stores leading to a normalization 
between online and offline retail channel usage, in an environment with low consumer 
sentiment."
Full year 2023 GMV in the Fashion Store segment decreased by 2.8%.
"Revenues 
reached EUR 8,241.9m and declined by 4.5%, 1.7% below the GMV growth rate, as the 
Partner Business share continued to grow, increasing its share of Fashion Store GMV to 39% 
in Q4 2023 (prior year: 36%)."
"Fashion Store profitability on the other hand significantly 
improved as a consequence of our strong focus on cost efficiencies."
"Adjusted EBIT for the 
year ended at EUR 282.3m compared to EUR 91.6m in 2022."
"Adjusted EBIT margin improved 
to 3.4% in 2023 (1.1% in 2022)."
"In 2022 revenue for the Fashion Store segment was adjusted by EUR -635.8m as internal 
stock transfers and services are no longer reported as Fashion Store segment revenues but 
netted with the corresponding cost lines and thus reported on a net basis starting Q1 2023."
"This change follows a corresponding adjustment in the internal steering of our segments to 
focus more on the contribution of our segments to the group figures."
"The change does neither 
impact group nor Offprice GMV, revenue, gross margin, or adjusted EBIT, nor Fashion Store 
GMV and adjusted EBIT."
"In 2023, the Offprice segment continued to show a strong revenue increase of 10.8% year-
on-year reaching revenues of EUR 1,776.1m as we successfully captured demand through our 
Lounge by Zalando proposition mainly in the H1 2023."
"Adjusted EBIT decreased to EUR 43.6m 
and is translating to an adjusted EBIT margin of 2.5% (prior year: 3.5%)."
"All other segments (including ZMS) revenue showed an increase of 7.0% year-on-year to 
EUR 399.6m, primarily through the inclusion of Highsnobiety which has been consolidated 
since Q3 2022."
"ZMS has on the other hand seen brand partners spending more cautiously on

marketing."
"The adjusted EBIT in all other segments reached EUR 29.4m (-26.2% on a year-
on-year basis) with an adjusted EBIT margin of 7.4% (prior year: 10.7%)."
"In comparison to prior year, the significant improvement of the cash flow from operating 
activities of EUR 489.6m resulted primarily from the positive development of our operating 
income, strong improvement in our net working capital, as well as the collection of VAT 
receivables mentioned above."
"The lower capex compared to prior year reflects shifts 
of investments beyond 2023, as well as the adaptation to the current economic environment."
"The cash flow from investing activities consisted of investments in term deposits amounting to 
EUR 50.0m in 2023."
"In the prior year, the cash flow from investing activities comprised the 
purchase price paid for the acquisition of Highsnobiety of EUR 123.6m."
"Our free cash flow improved by EUR 702.6m from EUR -18.8m to EUR 683.8m compared to 
prior year."
"Cash flow from financing activities of EUR -123.6m (prior year: EUR -245.9m) predominately 
consisted of payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities in the amount of EUR 128.1m."
"Overall, cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 508.5m during the year and remained 
very strong at EUR 2,533.2m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: EUR 2,024.8m)."
"Credit facility
On May 20, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit facility for an amount of EUR 1,250.0m 
with a group of banks which substitutes the former EUR 500.0m revolving credit facility."
"The 
facility can be drawn in EUR and utilized for general business purposes (including acquisitions) 
as well as for guarantees."
"The facility initially expires on May 20, 2027 but can be extended 
until May 20, 2029 and can be increased up to an amount of EUR 1,500.0m."
"As of December 31, 2023 an amount of EUR 99.6m had been utilized for bank guarantees and 
letters of credit (prior year: EUR 113.8m)."
"Financial position
The group’s financial position is shown in the following condensed statement of 
financial position."
"The statement of financial position is dominated by property, plant and 
equipment, net working capital as well as cash and cash equivalents."
"In 2023, the increase in non-current assets was significantly impacted by additions to 
property, plant and equipment of EUR 217.5m (prior year: EUR 304.6m) primarily relating to 
the fulfillment centers in France, Germany and Poland."
"Furthermore, 
in fiscal year 2023, additions related to capitalized development costs as well as to 
prepayments and assets under development amounted to EUR 74.8m (prior year: EUR 75.1m)."
"Key components of the software used by us are developed internally, e.g."
"order and fulfillment 
processes are supported using internally developed software."
"The development of current assets was essentially driven by a decrease in inventories 
and other non-financial assets almost completely compensated by the increase in cash 
and cash equivalents."
"In 2023, inventories reduced by 20.4% to EUR 1,440.9m (prior year: 
EUR 1,809.5m), due to a more decisive buying compared to last year."
"The decrease in other 
non-financial assets by 42.0% to EUR 265.4m (prior year: EUR 457.9m) is primarily 
attributable to the collection of VAT receivables in Poland in 2023."
"Both effects were almost 
completely compensated by an increase in cash and cash equivalents."
"For more detailed 
information on the cash and cash equivalents movement, please refer to the section “Cash 
flows” of 2.2.3 Economic situation."
"Equity increased by 7.9% with a carrying amount of EUR 2,373.1m as of December 31, 2023 
(prior year: EUR 2,199.2m)."
"The increase primarily stems from our positive total 
comprehensive income as well as share-based compensation effects."
"In the reporting period, 
the equity ratio improved from 28.8% at the beginning of the year to 30.5% as of December 
31, 2023."
"Non-current liabilities movement was mainly impacted by our lease liabilities which increased 
by 14.1% to EUR 912.2m as of December 31, 2023 (thereof EUR 780.0m non-current and 
EUR 132.2m current) resulting from new lease contracts that commenced in 2023."
"As of December 31, 2023, suppliers’ claims against Zalando 
totaling EUR 590.1m were transferred to various factoring providers (prior year: EUR 794.2m)."
These balances were recognized under trade payables and similar liabilities.
"Net working capital, consisting of inventories and trade and other receivables less trade 
payables and similar liabilities, decreased from EUR -211.6m in the prior year to EUR -441.8m 
as of December 31, 2023."
"The lower net working capital is mainly driven by a decrease in 
inventories, partly offset by a decrease in trade payables and similar liabilities, reflecting our 
decisive buying in fiscal year 2023."
"Overall assessment
The Management Board expresses its satisfaction with the progress of the business in 2023."
"While the challenging macroeconomic circumstances limited our ability to grow, we were able 
to bolster our profitability and exited 2023 with a strong cash position."
"For us, 2023 was a 
transition year."
"We reviewed our strategy and the organizational health of our business after 
years of high growth."
"We reduced the complexity in the organization by concluding our 
reshaping program thereby increasing Zalando’s ability for speed of execution."

transition further unfolded as evidenced by all-time highs in business volume of our Partner 
Business and Zalando Fulfillment Solutions."
"On August 3, 2023, given the subdued demand environment and our trading in the first six 
months, we narrowed our GMV and revenue guidance for 2023 to the lower half of our initial 
guidance ranges of 1% to 7% for GMV and of -1% to 4% for revenue respectively."
"We also 
narrowed our guidance range for adjusted EBIT by elevating the floor to EUR 300m (initial 
guidance EUR 280m to EUR 350m)."
"In light of the continued pressure on demand throughout 
the year, we adjusted our topline outlook for 2023 on November 1, 2023 to a range of -2% to 
1% (from previously the lower half of 1% – 7%)."
"Revenue growth was adjusted accordingly to 
a range of -3.0% to -0.5% (from previously the lower half of -1% to 4%)."
"We remained 
committed to our path of profitable growth and therefore made no adjustments to our adjusted 
EBIT guidance range of EUR 300m – EUR 350m."
"With regard to capex, we adjusted the speed 
of our investments throughout 2023 to reflect the macroeconomic situation and slowing 
growth and therefore forecasted capex was lowered to a range of EUR 260m – EUR 300m 
(from previously the low end of EUR 300m – EUR 380m)."
"We met the updated guidance with a development in GMV of -1.1% and in revenue of -1.9% in 
2023."
"We also accomplished to meet the higher end of our profitability guidance with an 
adjusted EBIT of EUR 349.9m."
"Capital expenditure amounted to EUR 263.2m, aligning with 
the lower end of the revised guided range of EUR 260.0m and EUR 300.0m."
"Overall and despite an unfavorable macroeconomic environment in 2023, the Zalando group 
achieved its revised 2023 targets with a significant increase in profitability and closed the year 
with a strong cash position of EUR 2.5bn."
"2.2.4
Employees
The average headcount throughout 2023 decreased by 1,206 employees (down 7%) from 
16,999 to 15,793 employees compared to prior year."

"2.3 Risk and opportunity report
—
Identifying and quickly acting on opportunities as well as mitigating risks is essential for 
the continued success of our company."
"—
We define opportunities and risks as events that, in case they materialize, would 
result in positive or negative deviations from our business goals."
"—
In the current forecasting period, we identified no single risks or its aggregate that might 
threaten Zalando as a going concern."
"As an international company, we have exposure to macroeconomic, sector-specific, and 
company-specific risks and opportunities."
"This risk and opportunity report provides an 
overview of the implemented risk and opportunity management system and presents the 
risks and opportunities considered most relevant for Zalando."
"The Management Board of Zalando SE assumes overall responsibility for the development and 
operation of an effective risk and opportunity management system (RMS) and internal control 
system (ICS) for Zalando."
"The risk management and internal control systems are subject to monitoring by Internal Audit, 
which is embedded into the overall process."
"Furthermore, external quality assessments are 
also performed on each of these systems periodically."
"As a result of these various examinations, assessments, and reports regarding the risk 
management and internal controls systems, the Management Board is not aware of any 
circumstances that undermined the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems."
"Zalando’s Risk Management Policy, complemented with its Risk Management Manual, outlines 
the strategic principles for the development, implementation and operation of the RMS of the 
Zalando group."
"The RMS defines the organizational roles, responsibilities and authorities, as 
well as the processes and required documentation to identify, assess, control and report risks 
and opportunities."
"We continuously improve and enhance our RMS, aligning it with COSO, IDW 
standards and best practices."
"In this regard, in 2023 we improved our risk methodology with 
the goal to achieve a more concise and meaningful enterprise risk portfolio and to ensure that 
the business and risk functions focus their attention on the most relevant risks."
"We also implemented a minimum monetary impact threshold 
for documenting risks into our risk universe."
"This does not only make the risk inventory more 
manageable due to a reduced number of risks that need to be assessed and updated each risk 
cycle, but also ensures focus on the relevant risks."
"Further, we moved away from the 
commonly used risk matrix in favor of an improved visualization and reporting of the risks in 
our new risk matrix based on the expected risk values to display the two risk indicators 
“probability of occurrence” and “expected impact” in a more meaningful way."
"We want to 
ensure consistency in the calculation of risk levels and display of top risks to Zalando."

In addition, we switched our reporting, in line with best practices, from risk clusters to a single 
(top) risk reporting."
"In doing so, we ensure a detailed presentation of the most important 
drivers for Zalando’s risk situation and how we intend to deal with them."
"All risks that are 
considered “significant”, “material” or “critical” according to our RMS are featured as top risks 
in the risk and opportunity Report (ROR)."
"—
Provide a cross-functional view on the risk situation of Zalando to ensure better quality 
risk information and a more complete strategic view on company risks."
"—
Ensure correct focus and relevance of the flagged strategic risks."
"Furthermore, we have implemented an ad hoc reporting process to inform the Risk 
Management Team and the Management Board on an ad hoc basis about current risk events 
and major risk changes in materiality level."
"The systematic identification and exploitation of opportunities are important elements in 
ensuring our continued success as well as strong and profitable growth."
"Therefore, this is an 
important element of our RMS."
"Risk and opportunity assessment
All single risks and opportunities identified are evaluated with regard to their probability of 
occurrence and their potential impact."
"Probability and impact are assessed individually for 
each risk or opportunity over a three year horizon."
"The identified single risks and opportunities 
are aggregated using a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the company’s total risk exposure 
and compared with our liquidity and equity positions."

The probability of occurrence represents the possibility that a specific impact for a risk or 
an opportunity may materialize within the one-year time horizon."
"The impact assessment is 
conducted on quantitative or qualitative scales."
"The quantitative scale is updated according 
to the planned company result and it refers to the potential financial impact on profit (EBIT)."
The qualitative scale considers the impact on our reputation.
"We separately track risks that 
exceed EUR 225m expected value on EBIT as business critical, since they might threaten us 
as a going concern."
"In the assessment of single risks, we consider gross and net risks."
"The 
gross risk represents the inherent risk before risk mitigation whereas the net risk reflects the 
residual risk after all implemented mitigation measures are considered."
"In this report, we 
present only the net risk assessments."
"Based on the respective combination of probability and impact, risks and opportunities are 
classified as minor, moderate, significant, material or critical."
"The top risks and opportunities 
are described in detail throughout this report."
"Depending on 
the type and assessment of the risks, different risk strategies, or a combination of strategies 
could be applied by the risk owners after considering the corresponding costs and benefits."
"Risk strategies include risk avoidance, reduction, transfer (to a third party), or acceptance."

Internal control systems
In addition to the overall RMS, we have implemented a system of internal controls pursuant to 
Section 315 (4) HGB."
"Similar to the RMS, Zalando’s Internal Control System (ICS) is based on 
the widely accepted COSO framework as well as on the requirements of the assurance 
standard 982 published by the IDW."
"ICS objectives
56
The ICS enables us to provide reasonable assurance with regard to achieving the company’s 
strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives."
"This is realized through the 
identification of risks in our key business processes and the implementation of mitigating 
controls."
"The ICS envelops multiple business processes, including both financial and non-
financial reporting."
"The non-financial reporting includes Sustainability, Diversity and Inclusion 
(D&I), and Performance Management aspects."
"As an integral component of the various reporting processes, the 
system of internal controls over financial and non-financial reporting comprises preventive, 
monitoring, and detective control measures, which ensure a methodical process for preparing 
the aforementioned reports."
"The ICS is implemented in the company’s various processes which 
have a significant influence on financial and non-financial reporting."
"These processes, the risks relevant for financial and non-financial reporting as well as the 
controls mitigating these risks are analyzed and documented."
"A cross-process risk and control 
matrix contains relevant controls, including a description and type of the control, the 
frequency with which the control is carried out, the mitigated risk, and the person responsible."
The control mechanisms implemented affect multiple processes and thus frequently overlap.
"These mechanisms, among other things, include determining principles and procedures, 
defining processes and controls, and introducing approval and testing plans and guidelines."
"Improvement and communication
The ICS is continuously updated and the control landscape is adapted to the changing 
processes using a standardized risk and control matrix."
"The effectiveness of the controls is 
assessed annually either through a test of controls or a structured self-assessment process, or 
a combination of both."
A detailed risk-based scoping exercise serves as a precursor to this.

Illustration of risks
The individual risks that are part of the Zalando risk landscape have been aggregated using a 
Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the total risk exposure of Zalando."
"As a result, we 
identified no single risks or its aggregate that might threaten Zalando SE as a going concern."
"The following risk table and matrix provide an overview of the individual top risks that are the 
strongest drivers of Zalando’s overall risk situation."

As mentioned previously, we have adapted the visualization of the risks with the 
implementation of a new risk matrix based on the expected risk values."
"The high-level explanations for the top risks displayed in the risk table are as follows:
—
The risks related to climate change were in the prior years included in the buying and 
sales cluster."
"Though they were important risks, they were not the main drivers for the 
cluster assessment as “material”."
"The risks related to climate change were consolidated 
and reassessed in 2023 due to recently increased frequency of extreme weather events 
qualifying them as a top risk."
"—
The cyber threat risk was the main driver of the IT security and infrastructure cluster, 
which was assessed as a “material” cluster and featured in the annual report 2022."
"—
The market environment and competition risk was the main driver of the competitive 
environment cluster which was assessed as a “material” cluster and featured in the annual 
report 2022."
"—
The risks inherent to our business model were partly contained in several different risk 
clusters."
"We have now aggregated them into one overarching risk, rendering it a top risk."

Zalando SE
ANNUAL REPORT 2023
As an international company, we are exposed to macroeconomic, market and geopolitical 
developments."
"We deem the external developments described below as especially relevant to 
Zalando as they may influence Zalando’s top risks or lead to new risks in the short-, medium- 
or long-term."
"Persistent core inflation, high interest rates and low consumer sentiment were amongst the 
biggest challenges faced by European companies in 2023."
"This macroeconomic uncertainty is 
not likely to resolve before the end of 2024."
"The performance of the overall fashion market in 
2024 will depend according to our assessment heavily on the overall macroeconomic 
environment."
"Also, there are potential short- and medium-term risks due to global geopolitical instability 
resulting from events like the Russian-Ukraine war or the ongoing conflict in the Middle East."
Energy markets are particularly sensitive to such risks.
"If they came to pass, it would add to 
the consumer uncertainty, possibly further dampening consumer demand."
"It is becoming apparent that fashion and lifestyle will go from a 
light-touch regulatory framework to being a heavily regulated industry similar to Food & 
Beverage."
"Next we provide a short overview of the mentioned four top risks:
Risks related to climate change
Our purchase and sales forecast are based on common weather patterns, which include 
seasonality."
"Variations in seasonality due to climate change, such as the late start to the fall/
winter season, strongly correlate to the success of end/start of season sale periods, 
significantly impacting our sales targets, and therefore having implications to our business 
model."
"A late start into the fall/winter season will lead to the need of more heavy discounting 
on winter clothes in order to avoid overstock."
"Climate change has made 2023 the hottest year on record, with intensifying heat waves in 
Southern Europe triggering wildfires (e.g."
"Greece, Italy, Spain and Cyprus), while in some parts 
of Europe storms (e.g."
"Ciarán affecting Italy, France, Belgium and the Netherlands) and 
flooding caused devastating effects on human life, infrastructure and business performance."
"Due to climate change, those extreme weather events are now becoming more frequent, 
having consequences on our logistics network and affecting customer purchasing behavior."
"Mild weather and prolonged seasons are expected to continue, hindering the predictability of 
seasonal changes."
"In order to mitigate climate-related risks, Zalando approaches weather-
induced uncertainty with more flexible procurement and planning processes as well as by 
expanding its product range in non-seasonal areas."
"Still risks remain to Zalando’s infrastructure, services, applications and 
data being disrupted or unavailable due to cyber attacks such as DDoS
58, malware, 
ransomware or incidents of confirmed data disclosure to unauthorized parties."
"The increasing threat sophistication requires ongoing threat intelligence tracking and 
continual adaptive response to these new and emerging threats in order to protect customers 
and ourselves."
"We are also continuing to counter these potential threats with our awareness 
program as research shows that the human element is involved in the majority of all data 
breaches."
"Attackers often gain access to organizations using social engineering techniques, 
such as phishing."
"We expect this program to lead to a more responsible handling of data by all 
employees."
"High levels of competition within the online segment as well 
as from the offline segment are expected to persist for the foreseeable future, with companies 
competing for a declining share of consumers’ fashion spending due to the challenging 
macroeconomic environment and geopolitical instability."
"Strong competition comes from Asian 
low-cost ultra-fast-fashion e-commerce companies entering the European online fashion 
market and from local multi-brand heroes in the lower and medium price fashion segment."
"As a 
consequence of the fragmented competitive e-commerce landscape in Europe, we expect 
company topline and profitability to be pressured by continued cost inflation."
"Also, we expect 
increased promotional activity by all fashion players as a result of weak demand and excess 
levels of inventory to clear overstock."
"We believe that our strong customer propositions and partner relationships, together with our 
strategy to advance sustainability and diversity & inclusion across the industry, are providing 
us with a competitive advantage in order to continue meeting our ambitious targets."
"Despite the challenging environment, Zalando remains in a comparably good position with a 
proven business model, attractive customer propositions, strong relations with our partners 
and a robust balance sheet."
"We will continue to invest in intensifying customer relationships 
while driving cost efficiency and investment initiatives."

 Distributed Denial of Service."
"Misjudging the necessary adjustments and changes to the Zalando platform can lead to the 
migration of customers and partners and, as a result, to loss of sales for Zalando."
"To mitigate the risk of customers and partners churning our platform, we work on creating an 
environment where our partners can place targeted marketing campaigns and products in a 
distinguished way on Zalando."
"At the same time, we enhance our customers’ experience with 
inspiration by giving them fresh fashion ideas and engaging ways to see what’s new and what’s 
coming up."
"By creating an improved customer experience and offering tailored solutions we 
expect to gain the partners’ trust to choose Zalando as their preferred platform to bring their 
products to the market."
"2.3.4
Illustration of opportunities
Given the definition of an opportunity as a positive deviation from planned values, we 
identified no material opportunity that could help us significantly overachieve our targets."
"Going beyond the materiality boundary, our major initiatives such as deepening customer 
relationships and enabling partners and customers on our platform continue to be key drivers 
that put us in a position to seize opportunities and support our growth targets."
"Fashion assistant powered by ChatGPT
In our quest to innovate, we are laying the groundwork to unlock the potential of generative AI 
to enhance our customers’ online fashion discovering and shopping experience with the 
fashion assistant powered by ChatGPT."
"With one of the most comprehensive assortments in 
the market, customers can benefit from additional help in finding the perfect item for them at 
Zalando."
"The fashion assistant will provide customers with products relevant to their needs, 
enabling them to have ongoing conversations to refine their results."
"This technology will 
introduce a new way to explore and experience Zalando’s assortment and provide customers 
with more intuitive fashion inspiration."
"With the fashion assistant, we aim to create a trusted companion for customers, including 
privacy and AI protection in line with our commitment to offering an experience of trust and 
inspiration."

Virtual fitting room
Customers continue to expect a better online shopping experience."
"To meet this demand, 
Zalando has piloted a virtual fitting room that allows customers to create their own avatar to 
see how fashion products in different sizes would fit on their body, with a heat map showing 
where the item fits tight or loose on the created avatar."
"This new experience helps us deepen 
customer relationships and engagement."
"We also want to support the industry as it continues 
to adopt and leverage 3D digital design software and workflows to produce fashion."
"Another 
important goal of this initiative is to reduce returns."
"For those items where we provide size 
advice, size-related returns have decreased versus similar items where size advice was not 
provided."
"We are also working in parallel on a body measurement feature, which will allow customers to 
receive personalized advice based on their actual measurements."
"ZEOS Logistics responds to the challenges partners and brands face when stepping into 
Europe’s online market as a fashion brand or retailer, including balancing multiple sales 
channels, navigating relationships with local carriers and the significant investments for 
setting up logistics."
Many major brands and retailers are already on board.
"With ZEOS, we help brands and retailers unlock Europe’s full potential with a set of services 
that support them with new market entry, expansion, optimization and business steering."
"—
Private consumption in the Euro Area is expected to grow slightly, supported by real wage 
increases."
"—
Zalando’s long-term ambition remains to further increase its market share in the fashion 
market."
"—
For 2024 we expect GMV growth of 0% to 5% and revenue growth between 0% and 
5%; adjusted EBIT is expected to be between EUR 380m and EUR 450m."
"—
Our 2024 outlook reflects our ambition to return to growth while at the same time we 
continue to work on margin progression."
"2.4.1
Future overall economic and industry-specific situation
The global economy has faced a mix of macroeconomic challenges in 2023."
"While GDP 
growth was initially strong, it has begun to moderate due to the effects of tighter financial 
conditions, weaker trade growth, and lower business and consumer confidence."
"Financial 
conditions have become restrictive, with rising real interest rates impacting economic activity, 
especially in Europe."
"According to OECD, world GDP growth is expected to ease to 2.7% 
year-on-year in 2024, from 2.9% in 2023 and to bounce back moderately to 3.0% in 2025, 
as real income growth recovers and policy interest rates start to be lowered."
"Europe’s GDP is 
expected to grow by 0.9% year-on-year in 2024 from 0.6% in 2023 and increase by 1.5% in 
2025."
"After a slight contraction of -0.3% in 2023, Germany’s GDP is expected to rebound to 
0.6% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025."
"The recovery is expected to be driven primarily by consumer 
spending, as a result of decreasing inflation and rising nominal wages amidst a tight labour 
market
59."
"In 2023, the Euro Area experienced an inflation rate of 5.5%."
"It is anticipated that this rate will 
steadily decline to 2.9% in 2024 and further to 2.3% by 2025."
"This gradual decrease is partly 
attributed to the slow growth in domestic demand, which is expected to help in moderating 
both price and cost pressures
60."
"The table below shows OECD actual (through 2023) and forecast (2024–2025) private 
consumption growth rates for the period 2021 through 2025
61."
"However, the outlook 2024 is marked by uncertainty with geopolitical 
events and economic volatility being the biggest risk factors for future growth."
"62
Turning to the online fashion segment, it is projected to gain momentum again in 2024 after 
the post-pandemic slowdown in which consumers rebalanced spend towards in-store retail
63."
"2.4.2
Future development of the group
Going forward, Zalando’s vision is to build the ecosystem of fashion and lifestyle e-commerce 
and to leverage our best-in-class e-commerce platform capabilities that we have developed 
over the past 15 years to enable our updated vision."
"Furthermore, our mission is to be the go-
to place for quality discovery and entertainment in fashion and lifestyle, thereby we will 
continue to invest in making our e-commerce experience more personalized, engaging, 
inspirational and entertaining."
"Fashion customers should be more frequent visitors of our store 
and spend quality time with us."
"Next to serving our fashion customers, Zalando wants to be 
the operating system that unlocks quality e-commerce in Europe for fashion and lifestyle 
merchants."
"Our unique logistics infrastructure is able to serve customers across Europe in a 
fast, convenient and reliable way, tailored to local customer needs."
"With our B2B brand ZEOS, 
we are able to provide our unique capabilities beyond the Zalando Platform."
"In line with our 
updated strategy and in-line with our steering and decision-making shift from a sales channel 
view (Fashion Store and Offprice) to a distinction between B2C and B2B segments, we adjust 
our segment reporting structure accordingly."
"Please refer for further details to section 2.1.2 
Group structure."
"In 2023, we have experienced challenging macroeconomic conditions driven by inflationary 
pressures, rising interest rates and lower economic growth."
"On top of the overall environment, 
the e-commerce sector was characterized by a post-pandemic slowdown in which consumers 
rebalanced spend towards in-store retail
64,65."
"We 
saw 2023 as a transition year, in which we pursued our ambition to deliver profitable growth 
and continued to make selective investments through the cycle."
"Despite a weak top-line 
development, we were able to significantly improve profitability in terms of adjusted EBIT and 
adjusted EBIT margins year-on-year."
"For fiscal year 2024, Zalando expects to return to growth with GMV of the group in the range 
of EUR 14.6bn–EUR 15.4bn corresponding to growth rates of 0% to 5% compared to 2023."
"66
Revenue is expected to grow at a similar level as GMV, resulting in revenue growth in 2024 of 
0% to 5% (EUR 10.1bn–EUR 10.7bn) for the group."
"Within our segments, we expect revenue 
growth rate in the B2B segment to significantly outperform the group revenue growth rate 
(fiscal year: 2023 B2B revenue EUR 855m), while we expect B2C revenue growth to be 
modestly below group revenue growth rate (fiscal year 2023: B2C revenue EUR 9,298m)."
"We continue to focus on profitability across Zalando and anticipate an adjusted EBIT of the 
group of EUR 380m to EUR 450m, implying an adjusted EBIT margin of 3.7% - 4.2% (fiscal 
year 2023: adjusted EBIT of EUR 349m, adjusted EBIT margin of 3.4%)."
"We continue to invest into logistics and technology to enable our long-term growth ambition 
and plan capital expenditure of around EUR 250m–EUR 350m in 2024 (fiscal year 2023: 
EUR 263.2m)."

Overall assessment by the Management Board of Zalando SE
The Management Board expresses its satisfaction with the progress of the business in 2023."
"While the challenging macroeconomic circumstances limited our ability to grow, we were able 
to bolster our profitability and thereby exited 2023 with a strong cash position."
"For us, 2023 
was a transition year."
"We reviewed our strategy and the organizational health of our business 
after years of strong growth."
"We have reduced the complexity in the organization by 
completing our reshaping program, thereby increasing Zalando’s ability for speed of 
execution."
"The platform transition continued to unfold, as evidenced by all-time high business 
volumes of our Partner Business and Zalando Fulfillment Solutions."

As per definition GMV does not include B2B revenues."
"As such our GMV outlook for the group relates to the B2C segment only, meaning Group 
GMV equals B2C GMV."
"67  
Zalando invests into logistics and technology at Group level and does not segment these investments into B2C and B2B."
"continued to invest selectively into strategic areas of our business to boost future growth, 
such as our Designer proposition or our new ZEOS Fulfillment for partners."
"Zalando has a clear vision and strategy to be Europe’s destination for fashion and lifestyle e-
commerce, to be the go-to place for quality discovery in fashion and lifestyle, and to provide 
our unique logistics, software and service infrastructure to merchants across Europe."
"We are 
serving around 50m active customers across Europe, thereby covering 25 markets for Fashion 
Store and 17 markets for Lounge by Zalando."
"By capitalizing on the learnings over the past 
years and months, especially in adapting to a volatile environment, and by enhancing its 
relationships with customers and partners, Zalando is confident that it will be able to serve 
more than 10% of the fashion market in the long term."
"In 2024, our ambition is to return to 
growth while at the same time we continue to work on margin progression."
"The forward-looking statements contained in this management report are made to the best of 
the Management Board’s knowledge and belief, based on estimates made at the time these 
financial statements were prepared."
"These statements are inherently subject to a number of 
risks and uncertainties."
"Should one of these or other uncertainties materialize, or should the 
assumptions on which the statements are based prove to be incorrect, actual results may 
differ from these forecasts."
"2.5.1
Corporate governance
Corporate governance describes the system how a company is managed and supervised."
"It comprises the structure of all relevant regulations, processes and practices."
We believe that good corporate governance is the basis for our corporate success.
"It ensures 
that our company is managed transparently, effectively and responsibly towards sustainable 
prosperity."
"Good corporate governance creates trust in our company by our shareholders, 
partners, employees and all other stakeholders."
"Our sustainability efforts as well as our efforts to foster diversity and inclusion (D&I) form an 
integral part of our corporate governance."
"More information on the company’s sustainability 
and D&I activities can be found in our Sustainability Progress Report and in our D&I Report 
which are published on our corporate website under https://corporate.zalando.com/en."

"The remuneration system for the Management Board which became effective as of June 1, 
2021 provides for a total compensation consisting of cash and of variable components."
"The 
variable components include a long-term incentive plan (LTI) which accounts for the largest 
share in the total compensation."
"The LTI is share-based and is linked to strategic performance 
targets including financial and ESG criteria."
"The ZOP is also a share-based remuneration 
component and as such linked to the share price increase to ensure the alignment with the 
shareholders’ interest."
"The ZOP also provides for the possibility of issuing virtual options that 
are comparable to the usual remuneration of executives on the international talent market."
"The Supervisory Board deems the combination of the performance link in the LTI component 
and the share price link in the ZOP component to be suitable to promote the sustainable and 
long-term development of the company and to enable Zalando to recruit the best talent for the 
company."

"While qualification and 
specific needs of the company shall be the decisive criterion with regard to the Management 
Board’s composition, the Supervisory Board emphasizes the importance of diversity."
"Diversity is understood in a broad sense as the combination of individual identities and 
experiences."
"These identities and experiences include gender, nationality, ethnicity, life 
experience, and background (such as social or academic background)."
"The Supervisory 
Board strives to adequately consider the various fields of core competences of the business 
model."
"The Supervisory Board also takes the following aspects into account, in particular: 
—
The Management Board as a whole should have appropriate management 
experience."
"—
The Management Board as a whole should, if possible, have knowledge and balanced 
experience based on different training and professional backgrounds, in particular in the 
fashion, technology and e-commerce industry and should have international experience."

2023."
"Further, the former member of the Management Board Jim Freeman is a member of the 
board of directors of SoftwareONE Holding AG, Switzerland."
"Apart from that, the members of 
the Management Board of Zalando SE are not members of a statutory supervisory board or 
members of a comparable controlling body in Germany or abroad."
"Tasks
The Management Board is overall responsible to independently and diligently manage our 
company’s business with the goal of achieving sustainable growth."
"The Management Board 
develops the strategic direction of our company, coordinates it with the Supervisory Board and 
ensures its implementation."
"This includes the company’s sustainability strategy with the vision 
of being a sustainable fashion platform with a net-positive impact for people and the planet as

their joint responsibility for managing the company, each member of the Management Board 
has sole responsibility for the business area allocated to them."
"Our two co-chairpersons of the Management Board Robert Gentz and David Schneider jointly

ment of all business areas is uniformly guided by the objectives set and approved as a whole

a competent and professional manner."
"Each member of the Supervisory Board shall have the knowledge, skills and professional 
experience required for her or him to duly fulfil its tasks and responsibilities and shall make

decisive criterion, our Supervisory Board strives to adequately consider the international 
character of the company’s business."
"At the same time, the Supervisory Board pays attention 
to diversity, in particular to variety as regards professional experience and expertise, cultural 
and educational background as well as age."

within the first six months of a business year."
"Every shareholder is entitled to attend the annual 
general meeting, to speak on items on the agenda and to ask relevant questions and propose 
relevant motions."
"The annual general meeting held on May 24, 2023 
authorized the Management Board of the company to make provision for a virtual general 
meeting for a period of two years after the registration of the new provision § 16a of the 
Articles of Association in the commercial register."

relevant business developments."
"All relevant dates can be found on the corporate website

"Our compliance management system 
encompasses policy management, a help desk function, whistleblowing management 
(including internal investigations where required), business partner due diligence and 
compliance-related training."
"Within the reporting period, the Compliance team’s scope was 
widened insofar as the team now also conducts the risk assessment and minimization in the 
area of business-partner facing Compliance."
"With that, legal and ethical risks covered by our 
Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct, including related internal policies, are now centrally 
managed within the Corporate Governance unit."
"Our group wide policy landscape is built around two fundamental guidelines which are the 
Code of Ethics and the Code of Conduct."
The Zalando Code of Ethics outlines the standards to which we as a company adhere.
"Based on fundamental values of honesty, respect, trust, and fairness, the code forms the basic 
guideline of our work-related interactions."
"It sets mandatory standards and clear expectations 
for professional, ethical, and responsible behavior."
"Our Code of Ethics requires all employees 
to follow the law and also sets our expectations with regard to Diversity & Inclusion, respectful 
behavior and avoidance of conflicts of interest."
"Fostering a speak-up culture so that employ-
ees actively participate and raise concerns or report potential compliance breaches is an 
essential part of Zalando’s culture."
"This expectation is complemented by the promise to 
protect all those who report an incident in good faith from negative consequences."
"The Code 
of Ethics has been communicated to all employees in various languages and is available on our 
corporate website."
"It also stipulates the obligation for all employees to comply with our data 
protection standards, as set out in internal policies, principles and guidelines."
"Protecting 
personal data, as well as collecting, processing, and using the data in accordance with the law 
is fundamental to Zalando because it is essential not just for our employee and partner-related 
data but especially for our customers and their trust in our products and services."
"This 
customer trust is the basis for long-term customer relationships."
"Therefore, Zalando ensures 
regular employee privacy training and has designed actionable privacy principles to create 
awareness and guardrails for privacy compliant business design and conduct."
"For our 
employees we have a dedicated online resource with guidance on how Zalando handles 
employee data and sets out rights employees have in relation to personal data they share 
with Zalando."
"Specialized privacy roles are trained to support all business divisions with 
guidelines and standards to ensure companywide proper safeguards are implemented."
"Zalando is regulated under European and national data protection regulations and we closely 
monitor changes in legislation in order to properly adopt regulatory requirements."
"This ensures a better 
understanding of local challenges and helps driving well informed solutions by removing 
(potential) barriers when seeking for compliance assistance."
"Making ethical behavior a naturalness internally also leads to comparable expectations 
towards external partners."
"Therefore, the Zalando Code of Conduct outlines the standards 
to which we hold our business partners accountable."
"It covers the areas of Human Rights, 
including Supply Chain compliance and Labour Rights, Environmental Protection, Fair and 
Ethical Business Practices, Monitoring and Complaints."
"Our Code of Conduct is published on 
our corporate website."
"It applies to all business partners – including suppliers, service 
providers, platform partners, distributors, consultants and agents of Zalando SE and all its 
subsidiaries."
"We expect every business partner to acknowledge the standards set out in our 
Code of Conduct and require the existence of appropriate management systems and due 
diligence processes to be in place."
"Our compliance training entails our Code of Ethics, Code of Conduct and group policies, 
including anti-corruption related policies such as our group policy benefits, gifts, events & 
expenses."
"We train colleagues with leadership responsibility in person, respectively via video 
chat solutions."
"In the training sessions we discuss in detail all questions related to the relevant 
topics."
"We aim for a high level of knowledge of our leaders in particular about our internal 
guidelines as these colleagues with leadership responsibility should be role models."
"Employees 
without leadership responsibility are made aware of our compliance relevant regulations via e-
learning courses."
"The e-learning courses are mandatory for all employees who have a Zalando 
email address (except for defined roles with low compliance risks in logistics and stores)."
"Each 
mandatory training course is followed by mandatory refresher courses every other year."
Employees receive an automatic reminder to fulfill their training obligations.
"If the employees 
do not fulfill their obligations, the lead will be informed and reminded repeatedly until the 
training is completed."
"In the reporting period, 23 compliance basics face-to-face training courses (including 
Compliance AmbaZador onboardings) were carried out, compared to 46 in 2022."
"The 
reduction of our training offer originates from the switch to web-based trainings as default 
solution, allowing for a bigger number of overall participants per meeting."
"3,919 employees 
completed the compliance basics e-learning courses (2022: 4,988), among them 2,021 
employees of Zalando SE (2022: 2,785)."

Economic situation of Zalando SE
The results of Zalando SE’s operations are presented in the following condensed income 
statement and are broken down by type of expense within the company."
"In 2023 financial 
performance was impacted by the normalization between online and offline demand after 
COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures and lower consumer confidence that was reflected 
in restrained consumer spend."
"Thus we adapted our business to the volatile environment: We 
reduced our wholesale order volume and were more selective with the curation of our 
assortment."
"This resulted in slightly decreased revenues, but an increased 
slightly positive operating result."
"The 2.6% decrease in revenue was largely impacted by low consumer confidence, elevated 
inflation and continued pressures on consumers disposable income."
"Growth was particularly 
weak in the second half year due to above mentioned external factors."
"In the current fiscal year, the DACH countries generated 42.4% of total revenue."
"Revenue 
decrease was stronger in DACH countries than in the other European countries."
"**) 
The Rest of Europe region is comprised of Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom."

decreased by 313 on the prior year from 6,605 to 6,292 employees."
Amortization and depreciation increased by EUR 11.7m.
Other operating expenses primarily include fulfillment costs as well as marketing expenses.
The decrease of EUR 139.8m is primarily due to a decrease in these categories.
"The decline in 
fulfillment costs was driven by favorable order economics, the scaling of our partner business 
with a growing ZFS share as well as continued efficiency measures."
"Marketing spend 
decreased mainly due to the strong growth in Offprice in the first half of 2023 combined with 
slightly less spend on new customer acquisition in the light of continued subdued demand."
"The operating result for the year of EUR 14.1m increased by 1.4 percentage points 
of revenue and became slightly positive, mainly due to lower cost of materials and higher other 
operating income."
"The financial result mainly comprises interest expense of EUR 92.7m (prior year: EUR 42.2m) 
and interest income of EUR 92.0m (prior year: EUR 32.8m), as well as income from profit 
transfers of EUR 33.2m (prior year EUR 37.4m) during the reporting period."

"Disposals mainly related to loans to affiliated companies 
(EUR 282.9m)."
"Investments were primarily made to finance infrastructure investments and the 
expansion of business in subsidiaries."

(EUR -368.4m), and intercompany receivables (EUR -279.7m)."
"Cash and securities increased 
by EUR 530.4m."
"Decrease in inventories is mainly due to a more decisive buying compared to 
last year."
"Inventories mainly comprised merchandise used in the core operational business of 
Zalando SE."
"The decrease in intercompany receivables is primarily attributable to receivables 
from intercompany factoring."

"General information
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by accounting for assets and 
liabilities measured at amortized cost."

"The IASB has issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts subject to mandatory first-time application 
in the fiscal year 2023."
"Application of the new standard does not have any effect on our 
consolidated financial statements, because we neither have issued nor hold insurance

"Amendments relate to minor changes to IFRS 17, IAS 1, IAS 8 and IAS 12."

"Consolidation policies
A business combination is a transaction in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more 
businesses."
"Within the scope of the first-time consolidation of such a business, all acquired 
assets and liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position at fair value at the 
acquisition date."
"A debit difference between the acquisition cost and proportionate fair value 
of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is shown as goodwill."
"A credit 
difference is recorded in the statement of profit or loss."
"The consolidated financial statements comprise Zalando SE and its subsidiaries over which 
the company has control within the meaning of IFRS 10."
"The separate financial statements of the entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on the basis of the parent company’s uniform accounting 
policies."
Intercompany receivables and liabilities are offset against each other.
"Offsetting differences 
are recognized through profit or loss if they arise in the reporting period."
"The company 
eliminates intercompany profits or losses from intercompany supplies and services and 
recognizes deferred tax benefits and expenses from consolidation entries through profit or 
loss."
"The consolidation of intercompany profits involves offsetting intercompany revenue and 
other intercompany income against the corresponding expenses."
"Shares in associates, i.e."
"entities over which the owner can exercise significant influence 
within the meaning of IAS 28, are accounted for using the equity method."
"The same applies 
to joint ventures within the meaning of IFRS 11, i.e."
"arrangements whereby two or more parties 
have joint control over the net assets of the arrangement."
"Such investments are initially 
recorded at cost and subsequently updated to include any changes in the share of the 
investee’s (joint venture) net assets attributable to the investor (joint venturer) after the 
acquisition date."
The consolidation policies were applied unchanged compared to the prior year.
"Transactions conducted in 
a currency other than the Euro are translated into the functional currency using the historical 
rate on the date of the transaction."
"Financial statements denominated in the foreign currency of foreign group entities are 
translated on the basis of the functional currency concept pursuant to IAS 21."
"The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the Euro are 
translated to Euros at the mean exchange rate prevailing as of the reporting date."
"Income 
and expenses in the statement of comprehensive income are translated into Euro at the 
annual average exchange rate pursuant to IAS 21.40."
"Exchange rate differences are 
accounted for as exchange differences on translation of foreign financial statements in other 
comprehensive income."
"Monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the functional currency spot rates of exchange as of the reporting date."
"Exchange 
differences are recognized through profit or loss and reported in the financial result."
Non-monetary items in a foreign currency are translated using historical rates.
"We have assessed that basically all our 
intangible assets, except for goodwill, have a finite useful life."
"These are amortized over their 
useful life of three to fifteen years on a straight-line basis."
"The amortization period and the 
amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the 
end of each reporting period."
"Changes of the respective useful lives are taken into 
consideration prospectively when measuring amortization."
"Intangible assets are assessed for 
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired."
"Regardless of any indication of impairment, intangible assets under development and goodwill 
acquired in business combinations are tested for impairment on the cash-generating unit level 
to which the asset belongs once a year."
"The same applies to in the rare case that an intangible 
asset was assessed to have an indefinite useful life."
"Internally generated intangible assets are recognized at development cost if they satisfy the 
criteria of IAS 38."
"That is if a newly developed or significantly enhanced product/software can 
be unambiguously identified, is intended to be completed and Zalando has the necessary 
resources to do so, is technically feasible, and is intended for own use."
"Other requirements are 
the generation of probable future economic benefits and the ability to measure reliably the 
cost attributable to the intangible asset."
"Capitalized development costs are amortized over an anticipated useful life of an average 
of about three years."
Amortization of the asset begins when the asset is available for use.
Research costs are expensed in the period in which they arise.
"An impairment test is per-
formed once a year as long as the asset is under development regardless of any indications 
of impairment."
"The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the 
intangible asset."
"Gains or losses arising from the disposal of intangible assets are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized 
in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized."
"When testing for impairment pursuant to IAS 36, the carrying amount of an asset is compared 
to its recoverable amount."
"The asset is deemed to be impaired when the recoverable amount 
falls below its carrying amount."
"The carrying amount of that asset is then reduced to its 
recoverable amount through profit or loss."
"The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value (according to IFRS 13) less costs of disposal and its value in use."
"For the assets subject to impairment testing, the value in use almost always exceeds their 
carrying amount."
"Consequently, in these cases there is no need to determine their fair value 
less costs of disposal (IAS 36.19)."
"The fair value less costs of disposal is preferred only for 
transactions to be tested which occurred close to the reporting date."

is calculated using cash flow projections based on approved budgets."
"A constant annual 
growth factor is assumed for the terminal value and the costs of capital before tax used as a 
discount rate are measured on instruments with a comparable risk profile."
"The duration of the 
detailed planning phase is based on the (remaining) useful life of the assets being tested and 
is capped at five years."
"An additional convergence phase is added to convert short-term 
growth rates of Zalando of the detailed planning phase into a long-term steady state growth 
rate."
"In the case of a cash-generating unit, the terminal value is added to the planning phase."
"Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost and depreciated in accordance with their 
expected useful life using the straight-line method."
"Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit or loss when the 
asset is derecognized."
"The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate."
"Impairment of non-financial assets
The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that a non-financial 
asset reported in the statement of financial position may be impaired."
"If any indication exists, 
or when annual impairment testing is required, the group carries out an impairment test."
"Current versus non-current classification
The group classifies its assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position as current 
and non-current assets or liabilities."
All other assets are classified as non-current.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current assets or liabilities.
"Leases
The group as lessee
At the commencement date of a lease, Zalando recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease 
liability for all leases, except for short-term leases (i.e."
"leases with a lease term of 12 months 
or less) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value."
"Zalando has chosen the 
practical expedient to recognize the lease payments associated with those leases as an 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term."
"The lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise primarily fixed 
payments (less any lease incentives received) and variable lease payments that typically 
depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement 
date."
"A change in variable payments related to a change in the underlying index or rate will 
lead to a remeasurement of the lease liability at the point in time this change is effective."
"The 
present value of the lease payments is calculated using the term and risk equivalent 
incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in the lease typically cannot be 
readily determined."
The lease term is based on the non-cancellable period of a lease.
"Periods 
covered by an option to extend (or terminate) the lease are only included in the lease term if it 
is reasonably certain that such an option will be exercised (or will not be exercised in the case 
of a termination option)."
"In determining the lease term, Zalando considers all relevant facts 
and circumstances to assess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend 
or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease."
"In particular, Zalando takes into 
consideration future business needs, the lengths of the non-cancellable period as well as 
economic incentives like additional rent-free periods or penalties."
"Initially, right-of-use assets are recognized at the amount of the corresponding lease liability 
plus initial direct costs as well as less any lease incentives received."
"Costs of dismantling and 
removal are considered if they relate to the lease asset."
"Right-of-use assets are subsequently 
depreciated over the underlying lease term between one and seventeen years using the 
straight-line method."

Zalando SE
ANNUAL REPORT 2023
Depreciation of right-of-use assets is presented within the functional area to which it relates."
Interest expenses on lease liabilities are shown as interest and similar expenses.
"They are 
also included in cash flow from operating activities, whereas cash payments for the principal 
portion of lease liabilities are presented as a separate line item within the cash flow from 
financing activities."
"Subleases
A lessor shall classify each lease – this also includes each sublease – as an operating lease 
or a finance lease."
"A lease is classified as a finance lease if substantially all of the risks and 
rewards incidental to the ownership of an underlying asset have been transferred to the 
lessee."
"Otherwise, it is classified as an operating lease."
Zalando classifies subleases by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.
"Typically, this assessment is based on the lease term of the sublease compared to the 
remaining lease term of the head lease."
"Whenever the lease term of the sublease is at least 
75% of the remaining lease term of the head lease, Zalando classifies those leases as finance 
subleases; otherwise as operating subleases."
"For operating subleases, the accounting for the 
head lease remains unchanged and lease payments from the sublease are recognized as 
income when incurred."
"For finance subleases, the corresponding right-of-use asset is 
derecognized and a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the (sub)lease is 
presented."
Any difference is recognized through profit or loss.
"To measure the net investment 
in the (sub)lease, Zalando uses the (risk-adjusted) discount rate used for the head lease."
"Income taxes
The income tax expense of the period comprises current and deferred taxes."
"Taxes are 
recognized in profit or loss for the period, unless they relate to items recognized directly in 
equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case, the corresponding taxes are also 
recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income."
"The current tax expense is calculated using the tax laws of the countries in which the entities 
operate and generate taxable income effective as of the reporting date."
"Management regularly prepares tax returns, paying close attention to matters open to 
interpretation, and recognizes provisions based on the amounts that are expected to be 
payable to the tax authorities."
Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method on the basis of IAS 12.
"Deferred taxes 
are recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements and the tax accounts if these differences lead to future tax 
benefits or tax expenses."
"Measurement of deferred taxes is performed taking into account the 
tax rates and tax laws expected to apply at the time when the differences are reversed."
"This 
does not apply to tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model 
rules published by the OECD."
"Therefore, we neither recognize nor disclose information about 
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes."
"The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
the deferred tax assets to be utilized."
"Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at 
each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered."
"The group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax 
assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority."
"Inventories
Merchandise accounted for as inventories is recognized at cost pursuant to IAS 2."
"The cost of 
inventories comprises all costs of purchase (purchase price, import duties and other taxes) as 
well as costs for transport, handling and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition."
"This also includes a systematic allocation of labor and 
overhead costs."
"Cost is calculated on the basis of an item-by-item measurement, either based 
on goods market prices or moving average prices."
"Supplier payments that are to be classified 
as a reduction of cost reduce the carrying amount of inventories."
"The same applies to 
discounts, rebates and similar items that are deducted from the purchase price in determining 
the costs of purchase."
Merchandise as of the reporting date is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
"The net realizable value is the expected selling price less the costs necessary to make the 
sale."
"Adequate write-downs to net realizable value were made to allow for all risks from slow-
moving goods and/or reduced salability."
"When the circumstances that previously caused 
merchandise to be written down below cost no longer exist, the write-down is reversed."
"Financial instruments
General information
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a 
financial liability or equity instrument of another entity."
"Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position when Zalando becomes a 
contractual party to a financial instrument."
"Contracts are recognized irrespective of their 
classification as of the settlement date, that is the date on which an asset is delivered to or by 
the entity."
The trade date is the date that the company commits to purchase or sell an asset.
Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the trade date.
"Financial instruments classified as financial assets and financial liabilities are generally not 
netted; they are netted only if the group has a legally enforceable right to set off and intends 
to settle the amounts on a net basis."
"Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual

rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the financial asset is transferred."
"Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual commitments have been 
discharged, canceled, or have expired."
"The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date."
If there are listed prices on an active market (e.g.
"share prices), these 
are used as a measurement base."
"If there is no active market, reference is made to the market 
most favorable for the entity for measurement purposes."
"The amortized cost of current receivables and liabilities generally corresponds to the nominal 
value or settlement amount."
"Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as one of the following categories for the purpose of 
subsequent measurement:
—
amortized cost,
—
fair value through other comprehensive income, or
—
fair value through profit or loss."
"When financial assets are recognized initially, they are measured at fair value, except for 
trade receivables, which Zalando measures at the amount determined by applying IFRS 15 at 
initial recognition."
"For all categories except financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
the transaction costs incurred are included in initial recognition."
"The allocation to the aforementioned categories must be observed for the subsequent 
measurement of financial assets."
There are differing measurement rules for each category.
"This measurement category is 
used for trade and other receivables, other financial assets, cash and cash equivalents and 
short-term deposits."
"The contractual terms give rise 
on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding."
"The fluctuations in value recognized in other comprehensive 
income are transferred to profit or loss for the period at the time the asset is derecognized."
Impairment and foreign exchange gains or losses are nevertheless recognized in profit or loss.
No financial assets are classified into this category in fiscal year 2023 or in prior year.
All other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
"Hence, they are held 
within a business model whose objective is not to hold the financial asset to collect contractual 
cash flows and their cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding."
"Derivative financial instruments that are not effective hedging 
instruments are allocated to this category as well as corporate investments."
"Changes in the 
fair value of these financial assets are recognized through profit or loss."
"Impairment of financial assets
Zalando recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses for all financial assets other 
than those measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"At each reporting date, the loss 
allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses (general 
approach)."
"If the credit risk has increased significantly, the loss allowance is measured at an 
amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses."
"The same would apply to financial assets 
that were purchased credit impaired."
"For trade receivables, Zalando applies the simplified approach of IFRS 9 to measure the loss 
allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses."
"Zalando uses a scenario-
based approach for this purpose and takes into account sales-channel and country-specific 
allowance rates based on expected risks of default and how long the trade receivables are 
past due."
"Trade receivables – typically resulting from the use of deferred payment methods 
(e.g."
"pay by invoice) – have due dates of maximum 14 to 30 days, depending on the country 
the order is placed."
"For other receivables – resulting from the purchase of receivables due from customers of 
our partners for sales concluded in the Fashion Store – Zalando applies the general approach 
of IFRS 9."
"Because also these receivables have due dates of maximum 14 to 30 days, the 
12-month expected credit loss is the same as the lifetime expected credit loss."
"Therefore, 
as we do for our trade receivables, Zalando also applies a scenario-based approach 
to determine expected credit losses for other receivables."
"Receivables, together with the allowance recognized, are derecognized when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows have expired."
"This is the case if there is no realistic prospect of future 
recovery and all collateral has been realized."
"Zalando allocates financial liabilities to one of the 
following categories upon initial recognition:
—
fair value through profit or loss, or
—
amortized cost."
"Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities designated 
upon initial recognition as measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"In particular, these 
include derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments."
Gains and losses from the subsequent measurement are recognized through profit or loss.
"Trade payables, borrowings and other financial liabilities not held for trading are allocated to 
the category of financial liabilities measured at amortized cost and thus measured at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method after initial recognition."
"Compound financial instruments
Zalando evaluates at issue of a non-derivative financial instrument whether it contains both 
a liability and an equity component."
"For its convertible bonds, Zalando recognizes separately 
a financial liability presented within the line item convertible bonds and an equity instrument 
presented in capital reserves."
"The liability component is initially measured at fair value, using 
the interest and principal payments discounted with a risk-adjusted interest rate of a 
comparable debt instrument without a conversion right."
"The equity component is initially 
measured at the residual value resulting from deduction of the fair value of the liability 
component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole, i.e."
"the fair value of 
the proceeds received."
The liability component is subsequently measured at amortized cost.
The equity component is not remeasured subsequently.
"Incremental costs directly attributable 
to the issue of the compound instrument are allocated as transaction costs to the components 
pro rata on the basis of their initial fair values."
"Hence, the initial carrying amount of each 
component is measured at fair value less allocated transaction costs."
"Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Zalando uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest 
rate swaps exclusively to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate 
fluctuations."
"Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the 
date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair 
value."
"Derivative financial instruments are reported as financial assets if their fair value is 
positive."
"They are presented as financial liabilities in the statement of financial position if their 
fair value is negative."
"Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either through 
profit or loss or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge accounting 
requirements of IFRS 9 are met."
"As part of its risk management, Zalando has formally set out and documented objectives and 
strategies for mitigating risk when using cash flow hedges."
"A portion of the forward exchange contracts is used to hedge goods purchased in US dollar 
and Pound sterling and the resulting trade payables."
"Another portion of the forward exchange 
contracts is used to hedge goods sold in foreign currency and the resulting trade receivables."
"These forward exchange contracts are concluded in Pound sterling, Swiss franc, Czech 
koruna, Norwegian krone, Polish zloty and Swedish krona."
"If a cash flow hedge is effective, the changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded 
under other comprehensive income."
"Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the 
hedging instrument are posted directly as profit or loss within the other financial result for the 
period."
"The gains and losses resulting from hedges initially remain in other comprehensive 
income and are later reclassified through profit or loss for the period in which the hedged 
transaction influences the net income for the period."
"Zalando uses forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments to hedge foreign currency 
risks resulting from contractual merchandise sourcing transactions that have yet to be fulfilled."
"In addition, Zalando uses forward exchange contracts to hedge planned revenue in foreign 
currency against exchange rate fluctuations."
"These are recognized as cash flow hedges if the 
conditions of hedge accounting are fulfilled."
"The amounts recognized as other comprehensive 
income are reclassified through profit or loss once the hedged items are realized."
"In the case 
of contractual merchandise sourcing transactions, the amounts of other comprehensive 
income is derecognized via the cost of sales."
"The share of other comprehensive income that is 
attributable to hedging revenue is posted via revenue through profit or loss."
"Fair value measurement
The group applies measurement techniques that are appropriate under the respective 
circumstances and for which sufficient data is available for fair value measurement."
"In 
the process, observable market inputs are to be preferred to non-observable inputs."
"Assets and liabilities measured or presented at fair value in the financial statements are 
classified on the basis of the following fair value hierarchy."
"The classification uses the 
input parameters of the lowest category that is material to the fair value measurement."
"Interest rate hedges are measured on the basis of 
discounted future expected cash flows using market discount rates for the remaining term of 
the contracts."
"A best estimate is made of the amount of the provisions taking into consideration all the 
discernible risks arising from the obligation."
"This refers to the amount that is most likely 
needed to settle the liability."
"Provisions with a residual term of more than one year are 
discounted on the reporting date."
"Dismantling obligations
The group recognizes provisions for dismantling obligations for leasehold improvements in the 
leased fulfillment centers, office buildings and outlet stores."
"The provision is recognized at an 
amount equivalent to the present value of the estimated future dismantling obligations."
"The 
dismantling obligations are recognized as part of the cost of leasehold improvements for the 
corresponding amount."
"The estimated cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that is 
commensurate with the maturity and the risk profile."
"Unwinding of the obligation is recognized 
as an interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income."
"Share-based payments
The share-based payment programs in the group are accounted for as equity-settled share-
based payments."
"Zalando recognizes the equity-settled share-based payments as expenses at the fair value 
of the granted options."
"Expense recognition and the addition to the capital reserves are 
performed over the contractually agreed vesting period."
"The vesting period is the period in 
which the performance and service conditions must be fulfilled."
"The fair value of the options 
granted is measured at the grant date and not adjusted subsequently."
"The income or expense 
recognized in profit or loss for the period corresponds to the change in cumulative expenses 
recognized in the reporting period."
"No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest due to a service or 
performance condition not being fulfilled."
"Equity-settled payment models with market-related 
performance conditions and other non-vesting conditions affect the fair value of the granted 
options on the grant date only."
"When the terms of an equity-settled transaction are modified, the minimum expense 
recognized is the expense that would have been incurred if the original terms of the 
arrangement had been fulfilled."
"Zalando also recognizes increases in the fair value of the equity instruments granted due 
to modifications."
"When an equity-settled award is canceled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of 
cancellation."
Any expense not yet recognized for the award is recognized immediately.
"However, if a new award is substituted for the canceled award and designated as 
a replacement award on the grant date, the new awards are treated as if they were 
a modification of the original award."
"Revenue recognition
Zalando generates revenue through our main business models in which we promise to transfer 
distinct goods or services to customers and partners:
—
Wholesale means that we buy inventory from brands and sell it to customers for our own 
account."
"The same applies to goods sold via Lounge by Zalando or within our brick-and-
mortar outlet stores."
"—
Our Partner Program and Connected Retail enable brands and retailers to sell their 
merchandise via Zalando while maintaining full control over their offer, content, and 
pricing."
"—
Zalando Fulfillment Solutions (ZFS) is a key add-on service to the Partner Program which 
allows brand partners to leverage our European logistics network across 23 markets to 
increase customer reach, convenience and customer satisfaction."
"—
Zalando E-commerce Operating System (ZEOS) is our new B2B brand launched in 2023."
"With ZEOS, we are building an operating system for the fashion and lifestyle industry that 
will enable brands and retailers to manage their multi-channel businesses across Europe 
within one unified platform."
"The multi-channel B2B fulfillment solution we launched in 
2022 has been moved under the new brand and is now known as ZEOS Fulfillment."
"Going 
forward, ZEOS will also include Zalando Logistics Solutions, including ZFS."

Revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 15 when the goods or 
services promised are transferred to the customer."
"Contractual performance obligations are 
typically satisfied when goods are handed over to the customer."
"Revenue is measured at the 
amount of the consideration Zalando expects to receive in exchange for transferring the 
promised goods and services."
"Within Wholesale, Lounge by Zalando and Outlet, we concluded 
that Zalando is the principal in those revenue arrangement because we control the goods 
before transferring them to the customer."
"Therefore, revenue is recognized in full."
"However, in 
the Partner Program and Connected Retail, we do not control the goods before transferring 
them to the customer."
"Hence, revenue is recognized in the amount of the commission that 
Zalando as agent of those revenue arrangements expects to receive from the partner."
"For 
services (ZEOS and ZMS) we render to partners Zalando is the principal and hence, 
recognizes all fees within revenue that we expect to receive from our partners for rendering 
those services."
"Revenue is recorded net of sales deductions, taxes and duties."
"Zalando identifies its performance obligations as the distinct goods or services promised in 
a contract with a customer."
"Apart from Zalando Plus, the goods or services promised by 
Zalando (goods, delivery and return with a return policy of up to 100 days, and customer care, 
express delivery or minimum order fee) create a bundle that is distinct, i.e."
"the identified 
performance obligation."
"In contrast, services promised to our partners (Partner Program, 
Connected Retail, ZEOS or ZMS) are separately identifiable performance obligations."
"When selling merchandise to customers, Zalando transfers control over the promised goods 
and services at a point in time."
This is generally the case when the goods are delivered.
"Also for services rendered to our partners (Partner Program, Connected Retail, ZEOS or ZMS) 
revenue is recognized at the point in time the underlying performance obligations towards our 
partners are satisfied."
"In contrast, performance obligations under Zalando Plus are stand-
ready obligations that are satisfied over time."
"Therefore, revenue is recognized on a straight-
line basis over the 12-month subscription period."
"In assessing the consideration expected to be received, Zalando takes into account the 
right of return granted to the customers."
"Revenue is not recognized unless sufficient figures 
are available on the probability of the exercise of these rights based on past experience."
"The 
expected volume of returns is estimated based on sales-channel and country-specific return 
rates and recognized as a reduction of revenue."
Zalando offers its customers a range of diverse payment options.
"Depending on the payment 
option and the country the order is placed, payments are typically due within a maximum of 14 
to 30 days."
"Cost of sales that are recorded in full upon delivery of the goods is then corrected by the 
estimated amount of returns."
Zalando also presents expected returns on a gross basis in the statement of financial position.
"In this context, a right to recover possession of goods from expected returns is recognized in 
other non-financial assets."
"The amount of the asset corresponds to the cost of the goods 
delivered for which a return is expected, taking into account the costs incurred for processing 
the return and the expected losses resulting from disposing of these goods."
"Trade receivables for which delivered goods are expected to be returned are also 
derecognized."
"For customer receivables already paid and for which returns are expected in the 
future, Zalando recognizes a refund liability vis-à-vis the customer within other current 
financial liabilities."
"Government grants
Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will 
be received because Zalando complies with all attached conditions."
"Investment subsidies are 
deducted from the cost of the subsidized assets in the statement of financial position."
"When the government grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income on a 
systematic basis over the periods in which the costs it is intended to compensate are incurred."
"Grants received to compensate costs that have already been incurred are recognized 
through profit or loss and offset against the corresponding expense in the period when the 
entitlement arises."
"3.5.6
Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires our management 
to make assumptions and estimates that have effects on the amounts recognized in the 
financial statements and the related disclosures."
"Although these estimates, to the best of our 
management’s knowledge, are based on the current events and circumstances, there may 
be deviations between estimated and actual results."
"All estimates and assumptions are based on circumstances at the reporting date and the 
expected future development of the group’s business and the anticipated development of its 
business environment."
"If these general conditions develop differently, the assumptions and the 
carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities recognized are adjusted accordingly."
"Apart from estimates and assumptions, Zalando also uses judgment in applying our 
accounting policies that significantly affects the amounts that are recognized and presented in 
the group’s financial statements."
"Revenue from other services mainly comprised 
revenues from the Partner Program, Zalando Payment Services, Zalando Marketing Services,  
ZEOS Logistics (including Zalando Fulfillment Solutions and ZEOS Fulfillment), Tradebyte, 
Highsnobiety as well as shipping fee."
Further information on revenue can be found in 3.5.8 (10.) Segment reporting.

"The cost of materials amounted to 
EUR 4,942.3m (prior year: EUR 5,039.1m)."
"The non-personnel costs predominately contained marketing costs, office and warehouse 
expenses, depreciation and impairments for right-of-use assets, as well as legal and advisory

Other operating income amounted to EUR 20.6m in 2023 (prior year: EUR 28.1m)."

Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses amounted to EUR 58.5m (prior year: EUR 15.1m) mainly arose 
from our severance and garden leave expenses relating to our reshaping program totaling 
EUR 32.4m (prior year: EUR 0.0m)."
"Zalando launched the reshaping program at the beginning 
of 2023 with the aim to reduce complexity in the organization and to increase Zalando’s ability 
for speed of execution."
"The costs of this material group-wide reshaping program are solely 
disclosed in other operating expenses."
"Interest and similar expenses significantly increased compared to 2022, as well."
"This is 
attributable to interest and similar expenses from financial liabilities at amortized cost, which 
also significantly increased due to the rise in Euro interest rates in 2023, resulting in increased 
Zalando’s short-term financing instruments expenses by EUR 35.8m (prior year: EUR 12.0m)."
"Interests on convertible bonds of EUR 25.8m and interest on lease liabilities of EUR 17.6m are 
stable compared to 2022."
"Interest expenses from hedging derivatives slightly increased due to 
the more volatile environment of foreign exchange interest rates."
"Other interest and similar 
expenses mainly contain financial guarantees expenses of EUR 0.4m."
"The currency effects on other financial results are mainly caused by valuation effects for 
assets and liabilities in PLN and CHF."
"Other results from hedging derivatives slightly decreased 
due to the more volatile environment of foreign exchange rates."

Income taxes
Income taxes included deferred taxes and current income taxes paid or payable in the 
respective countries."
"Income taxes comprised trade tax, corporate income tax, solidarity 
surcharge and the equivalent foreign tax charges."
"As in the prior year, the statutory corporate 
income tax rate, including solidarity surcharge, for the 2023 assessment period in Germany 
was 15.8%."
The trade tax rate was also unchanged in comparison to the prior year at 14.7%.
This results in an expected tax rate for the group of 30.5% (prior year: 30.5%).
"Pillar Two legislation (see 3.5.3 New accounting standards) has been enacted or substantively 
enacted in certain jurisdictions the group operates."
"The legislation will be effective for the 
group’s financial year beginning January 1, 2024."
"The group is in scope of the enacted or 
substantively enacted legislation and has performed an assessment of the group’s potential 
exposure to Pillar Two income taxes."
"The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two 
income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting and 
financial statements for the entities of the group."
"Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two 
effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the group operates are above 15%."
"However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief 
potentially does not apply and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to 15%."
"The group 
does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes because only a minor portion 
of our taxable profits is attributable to jurisdictions in which the tax rate is lower than 15%."

"The deferred tax income of EUR 8.5m (prior year: EUR 0.0m) is described in further detail in 
3.5.7 (27.) Deferred taxes)."
"As of the reporting date, the Zalando group maintained unused corporate income tax losses 
of EUR 108.1m (prior year: EUR 111.3m) and unused trade tax losses of EUR 66.1m (prior year: 
EUR 63.6m)."
"For unused corporate income tax losses of EUR 102.1m (prior year: EUR 98.3m) 
and unused trade tax losses of EUR 65.8m (prior year: EUR 58.7m) no deferred tax assets 
were recognized."
"The utilization of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax assets were recognized 
in the past affected the tax result by a total of EUR 0.6m in the reporting year (prior year: 
EUR 0.2m)."
"The basic earnings per share increased in comparison to the prior year due to a higher net 
income for the period."
"Hence, certain options granted within the scope of EIP, VSOP, LTI and ZOP (prior year: EIP, 
VSOP, LTI and ZOP) were not taken into account in the calculation of diluted earnings per 
share."
"Contributions to the statutory pension insurance scheme amounted to 
EUR 69.4m (prior year: EUR 69.0m)."
"Personnel expenses are reduced by the capitalized development costs, further information can 
be found in 3.5.7 (11.) Intangibles assets."
"Personnel expenses related to the reshaping program amounted to EUR 28.7m, further 
information can be found in 3.5.7 (6.) Other operating expenses."
"Of these, EUR 74.5m (prior year: EUR 73.3m) is attributable to internally developed software 
and EUR 0.3m (prior year: EUR 1.8m) reported under prepayments."
"Intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to the annual impairment testing on the 
level of the cash generating unit or group of cash generating units to which those assets 
belong to."
"The annual impairment testing in fiscal year 2023 (as well as in the prior year) did 
not result in any impairment losses for intangible assets not yet available for use."
"Zalando does not operate a research and development department in the sense of an 
industrial company."
"Our software development departments optimize the existing offers 
and work on establishing innovative products in the market."
"Accordingly, research has a 
subordinate role and consequently research costs were immaterial."
Amortization of EUR 80.3m was recorded in the reporting period (prior year: EUR 74.6m).
"Impairment test for goodwill
Zalando recognized goodwill totaling EUR 137.1m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: 
EUR 136.7m)."
"The goodwill is primarily allocated to the Fashion Store, which is a group of 
cash-generating units and has been identified as an operating segment."
"The remaining 
goodwill is allocated to Tradebyte, which is an individual cash-generating unit, included in “All 
other segments”, containing Tradebyte Software Ltd."
and Tradebyte Software GmbH.
"The impairment tests for the two units (Tradebyte and Fashion Store) are structured 
identically."
"Consequently, the following applies to both impairment tests: The annual 
impairment testing was carried out at the end of the reporting period on the level of such cash-
generating unit and group of cash-generating units."
"Recoverable amounts were calculated 
using the value-in-use concept."
"Value in use is calculated using cash flow projections based on 
the most recent budgets, which have been approved by the Management Board."
"Thereafter, 
an additional period is added to reflect the strong growth of the Zalando businesses combined 
with the transition to a steady state situation."
"Beyond that, a terminal value is added as a 
perpetual annuity."
"The underlying planned financial statements reflect current performance 
and management’s best estimates on the future development of individual parameters, such as 
market prices and profit margins."
"Market assumptions, such as economic development and 
market growth, are included based on external macro-economic sources as well as sources 
specific to the business."
"Consequently, a risk-free rate, a market risk premium and a spread for credit risk based on the 
respective business-specific peer group were determined."
"In addition, the calculations include 
capital structure and the beta factor of the respective peer group as well as the average tax 
rate of each cash-generating unit."
The annual impairment testing did not result in any goodwill impairment losses.
"Such a situation did not exist as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: no 
such situation existed)."
"For those fulfillment centers, Zalando is committed to further invest EUR 106.5m (prior year: 
EUR 304.3m)."
"Disposals are mainly related to other equipment, furniture and fixtures scrapped 
in fiscal year 2023."
"Depreciation of property, plant and equipment totaled EUR 126.7m (prior year: EUR 108.4m)."
"Of this total, an amount of EUR 34.1m (prior year: EUR 24.4m) was recognized in cost of sales, 
EUR 75.5m (prior year: EUR 66.9m) in selling and distribution costs and EUR 17.1m (prior year:

Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
Zalando’s leases are mainly related to buildings (e.g."
"fulfillment centers, office buildings and 
outlet stores)."
"These contracts include options to extend and, in some cases, to terminate 
the contracts."
"Furthermore, these contracts contain variable payments depending on the

"Additions to right-of-use assets amounted to EUR 231.2m (prior year:
EUR 225.4m) and mainly relate to the commencement of the lease contracts of an
office building and a fulfillment center in Germany as well as a fulfillment center in Poland."
"As of the reporting date, the carrying amount of the lease receivable for an office sublease in 
Berlin commenced in 2021 was EUR 54.0m (prior year: EUR 58.3m) and the sum of the undis-
counted lease payments to be received amounted to EUR 59.0m (prior year: EUR 64.5m)."
The difference of EUR 5.0m (prior year: EUR 6.1m) represents the unearned finance income.
"Within each of the following five years undiscounted lease payments of EUR 8.1m (prior 
year: EUR 7.8m) will be received."
"The remainder of the undiscounted lease payments of 
EUR 18.3m (prior year: EUR 25.4m) is due over the course of the remaining lease term after 
that five-year period."
"During fiscal year 2023, Zalando recognized depreciation in the amount of EUR 127.9m 
(prior year: EUR 129.1m)."
"Of this total, an amount of EUR 19.1m (prior year: EUR 18.2m) was 
recognized in cost of sales, EUR 59.5m (prior year: EUR 54.4m) in selling and distribution 
costs and EUR 49.2m (prior year: EUR 56.5m) in administrative expenses."
"A total amount of 
EUR 14.5m (prior year: EUR 16.6m) of the recognized depreciation is resulting from the 
impairment of right-of-use assets for buildings which are planned to not be used for our own 
business any longer but rather partially subleased."
"As a rule, 
adjustments will be made, if applicable, once a year."
"On average, the rent payable is changed 
at a rate of about 80–90% of the change of the underlying index."
"In 2023, additional 
payments for such index-based rent adjustments totaled EUR 2.8m (prior year: EUR 2.3m)."
Options to extend the lease contracts are material from the group’s perspective.
"They vary 
between three and up to twenty years."
"Exercising all of these options which have not been 
included in the measurement of the lease liabilities, could lead to an additional total cash 
outflow of EUR 1,571.2m (prior year: EUR 1,197.8m)."
"Additionally, Zalando has made a 
commitment to enter into several lease contracts not yet commenced."
"These commitments 
mainly include a new fulfillment center in France."
"We expect the commencement of the lease 
contracts in 2024, which lead to total additional payments (including all options to extend 
these leases) of up to EUR 240.9m (prior year: EUR 503.8m)."
"Furthermore, Zalando leases office and photo equipment as well as cars."
"Such leases are in 
general either short-term leases or leases for assets of low value."
"Corresponding to our 
accounting policies described in 3.5.5 Accounting policies, Zalando applies for these 
contracts the practical expedient of IFRS 16.5 and recognizes lease payments on a straight-
line basis over the respective lease term in accordance with IFRS 16.6."
"In fiscal year 2023, 
expenses relating to short-term leases amounted to EUR 4.4m (prior year: EUR 4.6m) and 
expenses for leases of low-value assets amounted to EUR 2.6m (prior year: EUR 1.5m)."
"There 
was no material change in the portfolio of short-term leases during the fiscal year."
"Interest expenses on lease liabilities totaled EUR 17.6m for fiscal year 2023 (prior year: 
EUR 15.9m); they are recognized within the cash flow from operating activities."
"Cash 
payments for the principal portion of the lease liabilities totaled EUR 128.1m (prior year: 
EUR 110.8m); they are presented within the cash flow from financing activities (see 
3.4 Consolidated statement of cash flows and 3.5.7 (26.) Notes to the statement of cash 
flows)."
"The total cash outflow for leases in 2023 for the group (including payments for short-term 
and low-value leases) amounted to EUR 152.7m (prior year: EUR 132.7m)."
"However within balance sheet 
position, we recorded a decrease in lease receivable by EUR 3.5m to EUR 54.0m as of 
December 31, 2023 (prior year: EUR 57.6m)."
"For further information see 3.5.7 (13.) Right-of-
use assets and lease liabilities."
"The decrease is offset by higher financial instruments 
amounted to EUR 31.2m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: EUR 27.2m), largely due to an 
increase in financial investments."
"The increase in allowances by 
EUR 18.3m is mainly due to a relative and absolute increase in the share of prior-season 
inventories as well as inventories from Lounge by Zalando."
"Other receivables are essentially due from 
customers of our partners for sales concluded in the Fashion Store which have been 
purchased from our partners and assessed as similar in nature and function to trade 
receivables."
"The entire portfolio of receivables was reduced by bad debt allowances, as in the 
prior year."

Additions to bad debt allowances totaled EUR 86.8m in the fiscal year (prior year: 
EUR 103.7m)."
"Of the bad debt allowances recognized as of December 31 of the prior year, 
EUR 6.1m was reversed (prior year: EUR 8.9m) and EUR 119.5m utilized (prior year: 
EUR 125.2m)."
"Bad debt losses for uncollectible receivables amounted to EUR 121.4m in the 
fiscal year (prior year: EUR 77.1m)."
"Zalando continues to 
optimize and improve its steering of payment options and works with solvency providers for 
better monitoring of fraudulent activities, resulting in a lower level of bad debt allowances."
Additions to bad debt allowances are reported under selling and distribution costs.
Receivables do not bear interest and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
"The development 
was partly offset by decreased market values of derivative financial instruments amounted to 
EUR 2.5m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: EUR 42.7m) resulting from changes in foreign

"In 
addition, income tax receivables decreased by EUR 43.3m to EUR 36.9m as of December 31,

The parent company of the Zalando group issued 263,772,023 ordinary bearer no-par 
value shares (“Stückaktien auf den*die Inhaber*in”) as of the reporting date (prior year: 
263,531,672)."
"Each share represents an imputed share of issued capital of EUR 1.00 and 
entitles the bearer to one vote at the company’s general meeting."
"During fiscal year 2023, the issued capital less nominal value of our treasury shares of the 
parent company was increased by a total of EUR 0.2m (prior year: EUR 1.5m) to EUR 263.8m 
(prior year: EUR 263.5m) by making partial use of the conditional capital 2014 and 2016."
"The 
capital contribution for the newly issued shares is fully paid in."
"In the fiscal year, 
contributions were made under share-based payment plans in accordance with IFRS 2 of 
EUR 83.0m (prior year: EUR 72.5m)."
"Capital reserves was also increased by an equity item in 
accordance with IAS 12.68C of EUR 0.8m."
"The contributions made for newly issued shares 
increased the capital reserve by EUR 3.3m (prior year: EUR 26.3m mainly related to the issue 
of new shares due to the acquisition of Highsnobiety)."
"Furthermore, the capital reserve was 
affected by the transfer of treasury shares to employees by EUR -0.3m (prior year: EUR 2.0m) 
and deferred taxes from share-based payments of EUR -1.1m (prior year: EUR -15.1m)."
"Only in 
the prior year, capital reserve was also reduced by an amount of EUR 134.0m due to the 
repurchase of treasury shares."
"In 2023, Zalando SE has not repurchased treasury shares (prior year: 2,200,000)."
"Total 
repurchased shares as of December 31, 2023 amounted to a notional share in share capital of 
EUR 3,276,578 (prior year: EUR 4,558,107) and thus to 1.24% (prior year: 1.73%) of share 
capital."
The treasury shares are to be used to serve employee stock option plans.

EUR 34.8m (prior year: expense of EUR 75.6m) was recycled from other reserves to 
revenue."
"Furthermore, the historical costs for inventories were decreased by EUR 10.0m 
due to reclassifications from other reserves to inventories (prior year: decrease of inventories 
by EUR 40.9m)."

All of the equity of the group is equity of the shareholders of Zalando SE, hence no equity is 
held by non-controlling interests."
"The share of non-controlling interests – which arose from the 
acquisition and first-time full consolidation of Anatwine Ltd."
"in 2017 – was reduced to zero in 
the prior year."
The development of equity is shown in the statement of changes in equity.

Share-based payments
As of the reporting date, Zalando has various share-based payment awards in place for 
which expenses amounting to EUR 83.0m (prior year: EUR 72.5m) have been recognized."
The awards material to our consolidated financial statements are described in detail below.
"All these awards are accounted for as equity-settled plans granted to employees and 
executives in 2023 and prior years."
"The basic assumption is that the rules of any program 
apply to all participants equally, however, compliance with the jurisdictions concerned 
sometimes require minor adjustments for a certain group of participants."
"Description of the Management Board programs 
SOP 2013
The options of SOP 2013 were granted to the members of the Management Board in fiscal 
year 2013."
"SOP 2013 consists of options that entitle each member of the Management Board 
to acquire 3,272,500 new shares in the company."
"Each option entitles the beneficiaries to 
acquire one share."
The exercise price is EUR 15.63 per option.
"The beneficiaries can alter-
natively request a reduction of the exercise price from EUR 15.63 to EUR 1.00 for all or some 
of the options already vested."
"In this case, the number of options is reduced so that it leaves 
the beneficiaries at the time of the request neither better nor worse off economically."
"The 
options granted to the beneficiaries vested in monthly tranches over a five-year period."
"The 
last tranche of SOP 2013 vested in November 2018."
"The exercise of the options requires the 
expiry of a four-year waiting period and the achievement of the performance criterion which 
was determined in a compound annual revenue growth rate during the four-year waiting 
period."
"The waiting period ended in December 2017 and the performance criterion was 
achieved at the end of this period."
"Prior to July 27, 2020, the options could only be exercised 
in defined exercise windows, namely within three weeks of the publication of a quarterly 
statement, a half year report or the annual financial statements."
"Each option relates 
to one share in the company and has an exercise price of EUR 47.44."
"The options vest in 
quarterly tranches over a five-year period."
"The options can only be exercised after the expiry 
of a waiting period of four years commencing on the effective date December 1, 2018, for 
57% of the options and 4.75 years for the remaining 43% of the options."
"The performance 
period relevant for the achievement of the performance criterion equals the waiting period (i.e."
4 and 4.75 years) for the respective options.
"The percentage of vested options of the 
beneficiaries which can be exercised depends on the extent to which a targeted compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 15% has been achieved during the performance 
period."
100% of the vested options can be exercised if the CAGR equals or exceeds 15%.
"Upon the exercise of virtual stock options, the beneficiaries are entitled to the amount by 
which the share price as per the exercise date exceeds the exercise price of EUR 47.44."
This amount (the settlement value) is limited to a maximum of EUR 97.14 per option.
"In order 
to achieve this maximum amount the company’s share price will need to reach EUR 144.58."
"The company is entitled to settle its obligation by way of delivery of the respective number of 
treasury shares as settlement shares equivalent to the settlement value."
"Upon the exercise of equity stock options, the beneficiaries are entitled to the respective 
number of new shares of the company equivalent to the amount by which the share price as 
per the exercise date exceeds the exercise price of EUR 47.44."
"This amount (the settlement 
value) is limited to a maximum of EUR 97.14 per option."
"In order to achieve this maximum 
amount the company’s share price will need to reach EUR 144.58."
"The company is entitled to 
settle its obligation in cash or by way of delivery of the respective number of treasury shares 
as settlement shares equivalent to the settlement value."
"LTI 2019 and restated LTI 2019
With effect as of April 2019 Zalando expanded its Management Board by two new members, 
namely David Schröder and Jim Freeman."
"Each new member of the Management Board was 
granted options under a new Long-Term Incentive program called LTI 2019."
"In total 400,000 
Type A, 110,000 Type B and 274,000 Type C options were granted."
"Each option relates to one 
share in the company and has an exercise price of EUR 29.84 (Type A options) or EUR 1.00 
(Type B and C options)."
The options vest in quarterly tranches over a four-year period.
"The 
options can only be exercised after the expiry of waiting periods of one, two, three or four 
years, commencing on the effective date April 1, 2019."
"The performance period relevant for 
the achievement of the performance criterion equals the waiting period for the respective 
options."
"The percentage of vested options of the beneficiaries which can be exercised 
depends on the extent to which a targeted CAGR of at least 15% has been achieved during 
the performance period."
"For Type A and B Options, 100% of the vested options can be

exercised if the CAGR equals or exceeds 15% during the relevant performance period."
"Otherwise, depending on the extent of the shortfall of the actual CAGR from such target 
CAGR, the percentage of the relevant vested options which can be exercised decreases."
"At a CAGR below 10%, payout is zero."
"However, this 
adjustment of the number of exercisable options cannot lead to the number of exercisable 
options for a certain performance period below zero."
"For Type C options, 100% of the vested 
options can be exercised if the CAGR equals or exceeds 15%."
"Otherwise, depending on the 
extent of the shortfall of the actual CAGR from such target CAGR, the percentage of the 
relevant vested options which can be exercised decreases."
"At a CAGR below 11%, payout is 
50%."
Non-performing options (i.e.
"options that could not be exercised due to a shortfall in 
CAGR) with a four-year waiting period are forfeited without compensation."
"For all types of options, non-performing options with a waiting period of less than four 
years may become exercisable at a later stage, provided the relevant CAGR increases."
"The 
beneficiaries are entitled to the amount by which the share price as per the exercise date 
exceeds the exercise price of EUR 29.84 for Type A Options and EUR 1.00 for Type B and 
Type C Options."
"This amount (the settlement value) is limited to a maximum of EUR 70.16 
per Type A and EUR 99.00 per Type B and Type C Option."
"In order to achieve this maximum 
amount, the company’s share price upon exercise needs to reach EUR 100.00."
"The company 
is entitled to settle its obligation by way of delivery of the respective number of treasury shares 
as settlement shares equivalent to the settlement value."
"With respect to negative tax consequences resulting for Jim Freeman as a citizen of the United 
States of America from the application of certain provisions of Sec."
"Internal 
Revenue Code, specific rules of the LTI 2019, applicable to Jim Freeman, have been amended 
(the “restated LTI 2019”) and options vested until March 31, 2020 have been canceled and 
settled by the company as cash and share consideration."
"The company has indemnified Jim 
Freeman from the penalty imposed on the settlement value and for remaining options under 
the restated LTI 2019."
"Under the restated LTI 2019, the 17,125 options granted to Jim Freeman vest at the end of 
each quarter or, in case the vesting date is falling on December 31, on November 1 of each 
calendar year, starting end of June 2020 until end of March 2023."
"Vested options can only 
be exercised after the expiry of the relevant vesting period as described above."
"As of the end 
of each calendar year after the expiry of the waiting period all unexercised options will be 
forfeited without compensation."
"The LTI 2021 is a share-based virtual option program which is linked to the 
development of the company’s GMV as well as ESG-targets."
"Under the LTI 2021, the members 
of the Management Board are granted two types of options, namely LTI Shares and LTI 
Options, by way of a one-off grant for the entire term of their service agreement (sequential 
plan)."
"The LTI provides for the flexibility of the members of the Management Board to 
individually determine the proportion of LTI Shares (LTI Shares Ratio) and LTI Options (LTI 
Options Ratio)."
"For this purpose, the Supervisory Board sets a target value in Euro as grant 
value."
"The number of LTI Shares to be granted is calculated by dividing this grant value by the 
product of the share price as per the grant date and a fixed conversion factor for LTI Shares of 
1 and multiplying this quotient with the LTI Shares Ratio."
"The number of LTI Options to be 
granted to the individual Management Board member is calculated by dividing the grant value 
by the product of the share price as per the grant date and a fixed conversion factor for LTI 
Options of 0.4 and multiplying this quotient with the LTI Options Ratio."
"The number of LTI 
Shares and LTI Options which can be exercised is subject to, inter alia, their prior vesting, the 
expiration of the relevant waiting period and depends on the extent to which the performance 
criteria are met during the respective performance period."
"The options vest in quarterly 
tranches over a performance period equal to the relevant term of service agreement."
"LTI 
Shares and LTI Options can only be exercised after the expiry of a four-year waiting period 
commencing on the grant date."
"Further, LTI Shares and LTI Options can only be exercised 
within a fixed exercise period of three years after the expiry of the waiting period."
"LTI Shares 
and LTI Options which still have not been exercised as per the expiration of the exercise 
period are forfeited without compensation."
"The LTI Shares entitle the member of the 
Management Board to a cash payment in the amount of the difference between the company’s 
share price as per the exercise date and an exercise price of EUR 1.00 per LTI Share."
"The LTI 
Options entitle the member of the Management Board to a cash payment in the amount of the 
difference between our share price as per the exercise date and the share price as per the 
grant date."
"The payout (the settlement value) under the LTI 2021 is capped at 200% of the 
share price as per the grant date for LTI Shares and at 250% of the share price as per the 
grant date for LTI Options."
"The company is entitled to settle its obli-gation by way of delivery 
of the respective number of treasury shares as settlement shares equivalent to the settlement 
value."
"ZOP 2021
The ZOP (Zalando Ownership Plan) was introduced in April 2021 as a variable remuneration 
component of the Remuneration System 2021 for the members of the Management Board."
"Under the ZOP, at the end of each quarter of service, the participants are granted fully vested 
equity in the form of stock options as a reward for such quarters."
"Performance options can 
only be exercised after a waiting period of two years commencing on the grant date."
"The participants can choose how to 
split the quarterly tranches into performance shares and performance options."
"The conversion 
into stock options is based on different conversion factors for performance shares (1.05) and

mance options of the respective tranche, beneficiaries can exercise their stock options at any 
time over a period of three years except during black-out periods."
"Performance shares can 
only be exercised within three years following the grant date."
"The ZOP Shares entitle the 
member of the Management Board to a cash payment in the amount of the difference between 
the share price at the time ZOP Shares are exercised and the exercise price of EUR 1.00 per 
exercised ZOP Share."
"The ZOP Options entitle the member of the Management Board to a 
cash payment in the amount of the difference between the share price as per the exercise 
date and the share price as per the grant date."
"The payment claim (the settlement value) under 
the ZOP Shares is limited to 200% of the share price as per the grant date per ZOP Share and 
to 250% of the share price as per the grant date per ZOP Option."

"The options vest in 16 tranches

tranches over a period of three years."
"The performance target stipulates that Zalando must 
achieve a certain level of revenue growth over a period of three years, starting on the grant 
date."
"If the revenue target is not achieved, the options are forfeited without compensation."
The three-year waiting period commences on the grant date.
"At the end of the waiting period, 
the holders of exercisable options can exercise them at any time over the following two years, 
except during black-out periods."
"VSOP 2018 and restated VSOP 2018
VSOP 2018 was granted to selected senior members of the Management Team in 2018."
"In total 750,000 virtual stock options were granted."
"The virtual stock options break down into 
500,000 ITM (in the money) virtual stock options, which have an exercise price of EUR 29.84 
and 250,000 OTM (out of the money) virtual stock options which have an exercise price of 
EUR 57.38."
"For each option that is exercised, the holder receives a cash settlement of an 
amount equal to the closing price of the share of the company listed on the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange on the date on which notification is received that the option is being exercised less 
the exercise price."
"The company has the right to fulfill its cash settlement obligations toward 
the holder of the option by delivering shares instead."
"The options vest provided that the 
recipient has worked for the company for the period specified within a tranche."
"Vested options 
can only be exercised if the performance target defined in VSOP 2018 has been fulfilled and 
the waiting periods have elapsed."
The options vest in 20 tranches over a period of five years.
"The performance target stipulates that Zalando must achieve a certain level of growth during 
the waiting periods, starting on the grant date."
"If the performance target is not achieved, the 
options are forfeited without replacement."
"The waiting periods are two to five years commenc-
ing on the grant date."
"At the end of the respective waiting period, the holder of exercisable 
options can exercise them at any time over the following two to three years, except during 
certain black-out periods."
"With respect to negative tax consequences resulting for Jim Freeman as a citizen of the United 
States of America from the application of certain provisions of Sec."
"Internal 
Revenue Code, specific rules of the VSOP 2018 have been amended (the “restated VSOP 
2018”) and 250,000 options vested until April 1, 2020 have been canceled and settled by the 
company as cash and share consideration."
"The company will indemnify Jim Freeman from the 
penalty imposed under Sec."
"Under the restated VSOP 2018, the remaining ITM virtual stock 
options’ expiry date is the last day of the calendar year in which the respective lock-up period 
for such shares expires."
"EIP
The EIP was a yearly equity award granted to managing directors of subsidiaries, managerial 
staff members and selected key employees of the group."
"The EIP awards were granted in July 
(as a full annual grant) and in January (as a pro rata annual grant) of each year."
"The first EIP 
award was granted in July 2016."
"The options issued under EIP entitled the participants to 
receive an annual mix (portfolio) of performance shares and performance options depending 
on the total amount in Euros granted to each participant (the annual grant)."
"The participant 
could decide how to split the annual grant between performance shares and performance 
options and regarding the performance options, whether they would be granted as ATM (at 
the money) performance options or OTM (out of the money) performance options."
"The swap ratio was based on the fair value measurement of the performance shares and 
options."
"The portfolios vested provided the recipient had 
worked for the company for the period specified within a tranche."
"Vested portfolios could only 
be exercised if the performance target defined in EIP had been fulfilled and the waiting period 
had elapsed."
"The performance condition stipulated that Zalando had to achieve a certain level 
of growth over a period of four years, starting on the grant date."
"If the contractual perfor-
mance target was not achieved, the portfolio was forfeited without replacement."
"The four-year 
waiting period commenced on the grant date."
"The recipients could exercise vested portfolios 
after the waiting period of four years, except during black-out periods."
"It is up to the sole 
discretion of the Management Board to decide in each case whether the settlement of options 
will be processed in shares of the company (through conditional capital or treasury shares) or 
in cash."
"As of July 2019, the EIP was replaced by the ZOP (Zalando Ownership Plan)."
"ZOP 2019
The ZOP (Zalando Ownership Plan) was introduced in July 2019 to replace the EIP going 
forward."
"Under the ZOP, at the end of each quarter of employment, the participants are 
granted fully vested equity in the form of stock options as a reward for such quarter."
"Perfor-
mance options can only be exercised after a waiting period of two years commencing on the 
grant date."
"The participants can 
choose how to split the quarterly tranches into performance shares and performance options."
"The conversion into stock options is based on different conversion factors for performance 
shares (1.05) and performance options (0.3)."
"At the end of the two-year waiting period appli-
cable to performance options of the respective tranche, beneficiaries can exercise their stock 
options at any time over a period of three years except during black-out periods."

"Performance shares 
entitle the beneficiaries to a cash payment in the amount of the difference between the share 
price at the time performance shares are exercised and the exercise price of EUR 1.00 per 
exercised performance share."
"Performance options entitle the beneficiaries to a cash payment 
in the amount of the difference between the share price as per the exercise date and the share 
price as per the grant date."
"The company is entitled to settle its obligation by way of delivery 
of the respective number of treasury shares as settlement shares equivalent to the respective 
settlement value."
"Other programs
Zalando has a company-wide top performance plan in place and in 2020 introduced the new 
company wide share benefit plan for employees called Zalando share plan."
"Zalando share plan 
replaces the former programs Share Bonus and Share Invest."
"Top performance plan as well as 
Zalando share plan grant shares of the company to employees."
"Zalando share plan
Zalando share plan offers the opportunity for self-financed acquisition of shares by the 
participants (investment shares) with a subsequent issue of matching shares by the 
company as well as procedures for the granting of bonus shares in the company without 
cash consideration."
"Top performance plan
The purpose of the yearly top performance plan is to reward employees who have 
delivered excellent performance during the performance year."
"Participants receive such a 
number of shares of the company that is equivalent to the bonus amount granted to the 
employee."
"The fair value comprises the 
intrinsic value and the time value multiplied by the probability that the performance target 
will be reached."
"Weighted average fair value of option (in EUR)

The parameters used in the valuation were determined as follows: the share price was set with 
reference to the trading price of the Zalando share."
"The expected volatility used in the model 
is based on the historical share price of the Zalando share."
"A best estimate was made for the 
expected life of the option reflecting both, the contractual term and the expected, or historical 
exercise behavior."
"The risk-free interest rate for equivalent maturities was calculated using the 
Svensson method."
"The probability that the performance target will be reached was determined 
based on assumptions about our future performance."
"The increase was mainly related to our new fulfillment centers in France, Germany and Poland."
"Other provisions pertain to provisions for staff, which increased resulting from the acquisition 
of Highsnobiety and from our reshaping program, as well as retention obligations."
"The 
restructuring provision for the reshaping program was recognized during the year and has 
already been partially used."
"For more details, please refer to 3.5.7 (6.) other operating 
expenses."
"As of December 31, 2023, suppliers’ claims against Zalando totaling EUR 590.1m were 
transferred to various reverse factoring providers (prior year: EUR 794.2m)."
"These balances 
were recognized under current liabilities, i.e."
"trade payables and similar liabilities, because 
they have been assessed as similar in nature and function to trade payables."
"Accordingly, 
payments made to reverse factoring providers, including interest paid, are presented in the 
cash flow from operating activities (see 3.5.7 (26.) Notes to the statement of cash flows)."
"Trade payables contained liabilities denominated in foreign currency equivalent to 
EUR 174.9m as of the reporting date (prior year: EUR 75.5m)."
Prepayments received pertain to advance payments received from customers for orders.
"The balance as of the beginning of the reporting period of prepayments received was 
recognized in revenue in the fiscal year (so was in prior year) after delivery of the goods 
taking into account the returns of the underlying orders."
"In addition, our obligations to reimburse customers for returns decreased by 
EUR 10.7m to EUR 132.0m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: EUR 142.7m), largely due to 
the lower sales volume in the reporting period."
"The development of other current non-financial 
liabilities was essentially driven by increased VAT liabilities amounted to EUR 171.9m as of 
December 31, 2023 (prior year: EUR 161.6m) as well as increased liabilities from gift vouchers 
amounted to EUR 69.8m (prior year: EUR 59.8m)."
"(25.)
Convertible bonds
On August 6, 2020, Zalando issued two tranches (“Tranche A” and “Tranche B”) of un-
subordinated, unsecured convertible bonds with an aggregate principal amount of 
EUR 1,000.0m and each with a principal amount of EUR 500.0m."
"Tranche A was placed 
at a price of 100.88%, with an annually payable coupon of 0.050% per annum and a maturity 
of five years."
"Tranche B was priced at 100.00%, with an annually payable coupon of 0.625% 
per annum and a maturity of seven years."
"Hence, Zalando received aggregate gross proceeds 
of EUR 1,004.4m from the issue of the two tranches of the bonds in 2020."
"The tranches are 
divided into 10,000 bonds of EUR 100,000 each."
"An acquisition of control is an event where 
an investor indirectly or directly gains such a number of shares to control at least 30% of the 
voting rights of Zalando."
"The bonds for which this put right is exercised are redeemed at their 
principal amount plus accrued interest on the date of the acquisition of control."
"The bonds are initially convertible into approximately 11.1m new or existing no-par value 
ordinary bearer shares of Zalando."
"The initial conversion price was set at EUR 87.6375 
(Tranche A) and EUR 92.2500 (Tranche B), which represented a conversion premium of 
42.5% and 50.0% above the reference share price of EUR 61.5."
"The conversion price 
might change based on typical antidilution clauses."
"Unless previously converted, redeemed 
or repurchased and canceled, the bonds of each tranche will be redeemed at their principal 
amount at their respective maturity."
"The bonds were offered by way of an accelerated bookbuilding procedure to institutional 
investors outside specific jurisdictions in which offers or sales of the bonds would be 
prohibited by applicable law."
"Pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders of Zalando to 
subscribe for the bonds were excluded."
"The bonds are traded on the open market segment 
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange."
"In accordance with IAS 32, Zalando has evaluated whether the convertible bonds are 
compound financial instruments."
"The conversion right included was identified as an equity 
instrument, which has to be recognized separately from the financial liability."
"The liability 
component was initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, 
using the interest and principal payments discounted with a risk-adjusted interest rate of 
a comparable debt instrument without a conversion right."
"At issue an amount of EUR 441.3m 
(Tranche A) and EUR 423.7m (Tranche B) was recognized within convertible bonds."
"The 
liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost."
"The difference between the initial 
measurement and the principal amount is recognized as interest expenses over the lifetime 
of the bonds using the effective interest method."
"The equity component was initially measured at the residual value resulting from deduction 
of the fair value of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as 
a whole, i.e."
"the fair value of the proceeds received, less directly attributable transaction costs."
"This led to an initial measurement of EUR 57.9m (Tranche A) and EUR 71.2m (Tranche B) 
presented within capital reserves."
"From these amounts deferred tax liabilities of EUR 14.6m 
(Tranche A) and EUR 20.1m (Tranche B) were deducted initially (see 3.5.7 (27.) Deferred 
taxes)."
The equity component is not remeasured subsequently.
"As of the reporting date December 31, 2023, an amount of EUR 480.5m (Tranche A; 
prior year: EUR 468.7m) and EUR 458.9m (Tranche B; prior year: EUR 448.2m) is presented 
under convertible bonds."
"Accrued interests of EUR 0.1m (Tranche A; prior year: EUR 0.1m) 
and EUR 1.3m (Tranche B; prior year: EUR 1.3m) are presented within other current 
financial liabilities."
"Whereas the operating cash 
flow is derived indirectly, the cash flows from investing and financing activities are directly 
derived from the cash inflows and outflows."
"In 2023, we generated a positive cash flow from operating activities of EUR 949.5m (prior 
year: EUR 459.9m)."
"Moreover, interest paid on convertible bonds amounted to EUR 3.4m in 2023 (prior year: 
EUR 3.4m)."
"Further information on interest development can be found in 3.5.7 (7.) Financial 
result."
"The table below shows the calculation of the free cash flow based on the cash flow from 
operating activities."
"The cash flow from financing activities of EUR -123.6m (prior year: EUR -245.9m) 
predominately consisted of cash payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities in the 
amount of EUR 128.1m."
"Overall, cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 508.5m during the year and remained 
very strong at EUR 2,533.2m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: EUR 2,024.8m)."
"There is a decrease in deferred tax assets on options granted under Zalando’s share-based 
payment programs."
"In contrast to the accounting treatment under IFRS, expenses from these 
share-based payments are only tax deductible when the options are exercised by the plan 
participants."
"The corresponding temporary difference has been determined based on the 
difference between the share price at the reporting date and the exercise price of the options."
"Because the deductible amount depends, among other things, on the share price at the time 
the options are exercised, the amount recognized as a deferred tax asset is an estimate and 
may change in the future."
"Due to the application of IAS 12.68C an amount of EUR 0.1m (prior 
year: EUR 1.2m) of deferred tax assets on share-based payment programs is recognized 
directly in equity."
"Deferred tax from hedging derivatives (cash flow hedges) included in the positions trade and 
other receivables and other and non-financial liabilities are directly recognized in other 
comprehensive income."
"The corresponding equity position increased from EUR 6.4m in the 
prior year to EUR 14.7m in the reporting period."
"In total, deferred taxes in the amount of EUR 14.8m were recorded in equity or OCI."

ANNUAL REPORT 2023
The nominal and market values of the derivative financial instruments are as follows as of the 
reporting date."
"The market values reported correspond to the 
fair value."
"The fair values of the derivative financial instruments were calculated without taking 
into account opposite developments in the value of the hedged items."
"The market values of forward exchange contracts designated to a hedging relationship as 
well as forward exchange contracts that are not designated to a hedging relationship are 
reported in the statement of financial position under other current or non-current financial 
assets and liabilities."
"If all contractual partners fail to meet their obligations from the forward exchange contracts, 
the credit risk for the group amounts to EUR 1.2m as of the reporting date (prior year: 
EUR 16.5m)."
"The forward exchange contracts in place as of the reporting date have a remaining term of up 
to 13 months."
"The nominal value of forward exchange contracts with a term over twelve 
months is EUR 8.2m (prior year: EUR 22.3m)."
"In the reporting period, expenses from fair value measurement of financial instruments 
designated as a cash flow hedge of EUR 33.5m (prior year: EUR 14.4m) was recognized 
in other comprehensive income."
"In addition, the net gains/
losses contain effects from the impairment losses, reversals of impairment losses, derecog-
nition and exchange rate fluctuations of loans and receivables as well as liabilities measured at 
amortized cost."
"Allowances according to IFRS 9 were recorded for trade and other receivables 
only as the expected credit loss for other financial assets was not material."
These financial instruments are classified within a three-level fair value hierarchy.
"With regards to financial instruments that are regularly measured at fair value, the group 
determines whether items are to be reclassified between hierarchy levels."
"This is determined 
by reassessing the inputs of the lowest level that is of significance for fair value measurement 
as of the end of the reporting period."
No Hedging instruments used to hedge interest rate exposure exist.
"Offsetting
For financial assets and liabilities, no global netting agreements of the ISDA (International 
Swaps and Derivatives Association) or any other comparable national framework agreements 
or similar contracts that lead to an offsetting effect were in place in 2023 and 2022."
"Credit facility
On May 20, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit facility for an amount of EUR 1,250.0m 
with a group of banks which substitutes the former EUR 500.0m revolving credit facility."
"The 
facility can be drawn in EUR and utilized for general business purposes (including acquisitions) 
as well as for guarantees."
"The facility initially expires on May 20, 2027 but can be extended 
until May 20, 2029 and can be increased up to an amount of EUR 1,500.0m."
"As of December 
31, 2023, an amount of EUR 99.6m had been utilized for bank guarantees and letters of credit 
(prior year: EUR 113.8m)."
"The aim of financial risk management is 
to limit the risks resulting from operating activities through the use of selected derivative and 
non-derivative hedging instruments."
"The derivative financial instruments are used in the group 
solely for the purpose of risk management."
"Zalando would be exposed to higher financial risks 
if it did not use these instruments."
"The group’s management is responsible for the manage-
ment of the risks."
"Changes in exchange rates and interest rates can lead to considerable fluctuations in the 
market values of the derivatives used."
"These market value fluctuations should therefore not be 
considered in isolation from the hedged items as derivatives and hedged items form a unit in 
terms of their offsetting developments in value."
"Market risk
Market risk arises from changes in the fair value of future cash flows from financial 
instruments due to changes in market prices."
"Market risks include interest rates, currency 
and other price risks."
"The currency risk can be broken down into two further types of risk: the translation risk and 
the transaction risk."
"The translation risk describes the risk of changes in the items in the 
statement of financial position and income statement of a subsidiary due to exchange rate 
changes when translating the foreign local financial statements into the group’s currency."
"The changes caused by currency fluctuations from the translation of items in the statement 
of financial position are presented in equity."
"Zalando is exposed to translation risks coming 
from foreign subsidiaries in China, Hong Kong, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom 
as well as United States."
"Currently, Zalando does not hedge the translation risk for these 
subsidiaries."
"The transaction risk relates to the fact that exchange rate fluctuations can lead to changes 
in value of future foreign currency payments."
"Zalando operates in different markets and is 
therefore exposed to foreign currency risk generated from revenue and sourcing transactions 
in foreign currencies."
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge these activities.
"For this 
purpose, plain vanilla OTC derivative financial instruments are concluded and processed in 
accordance with internal guidelines that set out binding rules for the scope of action and 
responsibilities as well as reporting and controls."
"Risk exposure is hedged with a standard 
layered approach."
"The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument is determined prospectively through critical terms match based on currency, 
tenor and notional."
"The hedge ratio is established through internal approval processes and 
calculated based on outstanding notional volume of foreign exchange forwards in relation 
to the notional volume of the underlying highly probable forecasted transactions."
"As of the 
reporting date, the average monthly hedge ratio for 2023 was in a range between 63.0% 
and 99.0% (prior year: between 79.0% and 97.4%), depending on the currency."

of hedge ineffectiveness can be changes in the forecasted highly probable underlying 
business transactions."
"The foreign currency sensitivity of the group is calculated by aggregating all foreign 
currency items that are not presented in the functional currency of the respective entity."
These items are compared with the aggregated hedging transactions.
"The market values 
of the hedged items and hedging transactions included are measured at actual exchange 
rates and sensitivity rates."
"The difference between these measurements represents the 
effects on earnings and equity."
"If the Euro had appreciated 5% against the foreign currencies as of December 31, 2023 
earnings before taxes would have been EUR 3.2m lower (prior year: EUR 8.6m)."
"If the Euro 
had depreciated 5% compared with the exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 earnings 
before taxes would have been EUR 3.2m higher (prior year: EUR 8.6m)."
"This reserve would have been EUR 64.2m lower (prior year: EUR 63.6m 
lower) if the Euro had depreciated by 5%."
"Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a customer or contractual partner defaulting on payment, resulting in 
the assets, financial assets or receivables reported in the consolidated statement of financial 
position having to be written down."
Credit risks primarily concern trade and other receivables.
"The credit risk is provided for by portfolio-based valuation allowances based on historical 
experience and the maturity profile."
Uncollectible receivables are written off in full individually.
"Rising interest levels are generally putting pressure on payment providers, especially with the 
buy now-pay later concept."
"Therefore, the increased credit default risk of individual customers 
is putting pressure on Zalando."
There is no significant concentration of credit risk.
"In addition, for cash and cash equivalents, there is a credit risk that banks can no longer 
meet their obligations."
"The maximum exposure corresponds to the carrying amounts of these 
financial assets at the end of the respective reporting period."
"The company addresses this 
exposure by distributing its derivative financial instruments and cash held at banks over 
multiple financial institutions with good credit standing, and over money market funds with a 
AAA rating (according to Standard & Poor’s)."

Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk is defined as a possible lack of cash funds to fulfill the financial obligations 
of the company."
"This hazard may arise from insufficient centralization of cash where it is 
needed, inexact liquidity forecasting or an unbalanced investment strategy for the company’s 
cash reserves."
"Zalando manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly monitoring liquidity needs 
through an integrated platform for short-, medium- and long-term forecasting of the cash 
requirements."
"Additionally, the group invests the cash reserves of the company in term deposits and money 
market instruments and pools the cash balances centrally on a regular basis to ensure cash is 
located where it is needed."
"To reduce the liquidity risk further, Zalando uses reverse factoring as an additional financing 
source to extend the payment terms with different financial partners and suppliers in order to 
improve working capital."
"Under these agreements, the factor purchases the claims held by the 
respective supplier against Zalando."
"These are recognized in the consolidated statement of 
financial position under trade payables and similar liabilities."
There is no significant concentration of liquidity risk.
"The tables below show the contractually agreed (undiscounted) interest and principal pay- 
ments for primary financial liabilities and for derivative financial instruments with their negative 
fair value."
"All instruments in the portfolio as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, 
and for which payments had already been contractually agreed were included."
"Planned figures 
for new future liabilities were not included."
"The floating-rate interest payments from the 
financial instruments were determined based on the interest rates most recently fixed before 
December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively."
"All on-call financial liabilities are 
always allocated to the earliest possible date."

"Capital management
The objectives of capital management in the group are short-term solvency and an adequate 
capital base to finance projected growth while sustainably increasing the business value."
This ensures that all group entities can operate on a going concern basis.
"Capital management and its objectives and definition are based on key performance indicators 
derived from the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS."
"We therefore 
define the net working capital key performance indicator as the sum of inventories and trade 
and other receivables less trade payables and similar liabilities."
"The net working capital stood 
at EUR -441.8m as of the reporting date (prior year: EUR -211.6m)."
"Collateral
Zalando pledged financial assets of EUR 4.9m as collateral in the reporting period (prior year: 
EUR 0.0m)."
"The collateral provided may be drawn by the beneficiaries, should the group not 
be able to fulfill its payment obligations."
"These pledged financial assets of EUR 4.9m were 
released at the beginning of 2024."

The transactions were carried out in accordance with the arm’s length principle.
"All trans-
actions with related parties are related to the key management personnel of Zalando, i.e."
"Furthermore, trade and other receivables from related parties amount to EUR 0.0m (prior year:

Merchandise of EUR 271.0m was ordered from related parties in the reporting period.
"In the

"All other remuneration is 
classified as short-term benefits."
"The share-based payments were granted in fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023."

Business combinations
There were no business combinations in fiscal year 2023."
"In 2022, Zalando acquired 86.83% of all shares of Titel Media GmbH, Berlin (“Highsnobiety”)."
The acquisition-date fair value of the total consideration transferred was EUR 152.5m.
"The 
purchase price for 86.83% of the shares in Highsnobiety comprised a cash payment of EUR 
123.6m as of July 1, 2022 and an amount of EUR 26.5m settled by issuing 1,011,665 new no-
par value bearer shares of Zalando SE at a share price of EUR 26.15 as of the acquisition date."
"Besides this consideration, we have committed to bonus payments for Highsnobiety’s 
managing directors as well as current and future employees of up to EUR 14.2m over the next 
three years (see 3.5.7 (22.) Provisions)."
"The amount of acquisition-related costs according to 
IFRS 3.53 was not material."
The goodwill acquired was not tax deductible.
"In 2022, Highsnobiety contributed EUR 37.8m to the revenues of the group as well as a net 
loss of EUR 0.5m since the acquisition date."
"If Highsnobiety would have been part of the group 
since January 1, 2022, the revenues of the Zalando group would have been EUR 39.6m higher 
and the net income would have been EUR 5.2m lower than reported as of December 31, 2022."
"Accordingly, all synergies 
from the transaction were expected to arise in the Fashion Store and consequently the 
Goodwill will also be monitored at the Fashion Store."
"However, Highsnobiety continues 
independent operations, the business itself is managed separately from the Fashion Store in 
All other segments."

"In addition, Zalando Logistics Operations Netherlands B.V."
"will make use 
of the exemption in accordance with Section 403 Book 2 Dutch Civil Code to not prepare 
financial statements in accordance with Title 9 Book 2 Dutch Civil Code."
"(10.)
Segment reporting
Reporting on the business segments is in line with the internal reporting."
"The reporting to 
the top body of management of Zalando SE for purposes of internal control fundamentally 
corresponds to the principles of financial reporting described in 3.5.2 General principles in 
accordance with IFRS."
Zalando SE’s internal management structure is based on a sales channel perspective.
Our main sales channel continues to be the Fashion Store (online shops of Zalando).
"The Offprice segment includes the sales channels Lounge by Zalando, outlet stores and 
overstock management, and all other segments includes various emerging businesses."
"Revenue and profitability generated with external business partners as well as the internal 
transactions between segments of Zalando are being reported to the chief operating decision 
maker as required by IFRS 8."
"Due to this, the segment reporting includes a reconciliation 
column to reconcile the segment figures (including internal and external transactions) to the 
consolidated group figures (showing only external transactions)."
"The internal transactions 
relate to the exchange of goods and services between segments."
"The Management Board measures the performance of the segments on the basis of the EBIT 
calculated in accordance with IFRS."
"EBIT for segment reporting purposes is defined as 
earnings before interest and taxes."
"No information on segment assets or liabilities is available 
or relevant for decision-making."
"This change follows a corresponding adjustment in the internal steering of our segments to 
focus more on the contribution of our segments to the group figures."
"The change does neither 
impact group nor Offprice GMV, revenue, gross margin, or adjusted EBIT, nor Fashion Store 
GMV and adjusted EBIT."
"Of the total external revenue generated in the group, Germany accounts for the largest part 
at 29.6% (prior year: 31.1%), followed by Switzerland with a share in the low double-digit 
percentage range."
"External revenues are attributed to countries on the basis of the place 
where Zalando transfers the promised goods or services to a customer."
"Most of the non-
current assets of the group of EUR 2,540.5m are located in Germany (57.8%)."
"The group also 
holds considerable non-current assets in its fulfillment centers in Poland (17.7%) and 
the Netherlands (9.6%)."
"Cost of sales include valuation allowances of inventories for the Fashion Store segment of 
EUR 2.1m (prior year: EUR 4.5m), for the Offprice segment of EUR 18.9m (prior year: 
EUR 58.4m) and for all other segments of EUR -2.7m (prior year: EUR 15.5m)."
"The one-time effect adjustments are mainly 
related to impairment losses."
The group’s financial result is not allocated to the segments.
"From 2024 onwards, our steering and decision-making will start from our customers and as 
such shift from the sales channel view to a customer-focussed distinction between B2C and 
B2B."
"For more information, please refer to section 2.1.2 Group structure of our combined 
management report."
"(12.)
Authorization of the financial statements for issue
The consolidated financial statements and group management report of Zalando SE are 
published in the Unternehmensregister [Company Register]."
"The consolidated financial 
statements and the group management report were authorized for issue by the Management 
Board on March 12, 2024."
"We have also audited the group management report of 
Zalando SE, which was combined with the management report of the company, for the fiscal 
year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"In accordance with the German legal 
requirements, we have not audited the content of the parts of the group management report 
specified in the appendix to the auditor’s report."
"In all material respects, this group management report is consistent 
with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and 
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development."
"Our opinion on 
the group management report does not cover the content of the parts of the group 
management report referred to in the appendix to the auditor’s report."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any 
reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and 
of the group management report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the 
requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have 
fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we 
have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management 
report."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from 
January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters."
"Zalando customers have the option to return merchandise free of charge within the 
revocation period stipulated by law and, in addition to that period, the return periods granted 
by Zalando SE."
"Zalando’s executive directors calculate expected returns, for which no revenue 
is recognized."
"This calculation is based on assumptions and judgments in particular on 
country-specific, payment method-specific and month-specific rates of returns, taking 
seasonal influences into account."
"Revenue has a significant influence on the net income of the 
group and is one of the most important performance indicators for the Zalando group."
"Due to the high transaction volume of the sales of merchandise and the generally possible risk 
of fictitious revenue and the uncertain estimate of expected returns, we consider the 
occurrence and measurement of revenue from the delivery of merchandise to be a key audit 
matter."
"Auditor’s response
In the course of our audit, we traced the process of revenue recognition for merchandise from 
the order through to payment receipt on the basis of the process documentation provided to 
us."
"We also evaluated compliance with the revenue recognition requirements under IFRS 15 
and tested the effectiveness of the internal controls in place."
"This approach includes in 
particular the operating effectiveness of IT-supported controls."

addition, we examined the posting ledger for any revenue entries that were entered manually 
and analyzed the respective contra accounts."
"We also verified the clerical accuracy of the expected returns as determined 
by the executive directors of Zalando."
"We compared the assumed month-specific, payment 
method-specific and country-specific return rates with actual historical return rates, taking 
seasonal influences into account and analyzed them."
"In order to evaluate the assumed month-
specific, payment method-specific and country-specific return rates, we also compared this to 
the merchandise actually returned according to the financial accounting by the time we 
concluded our audit."
"Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the measurement of revenue from 
the dispatch of merchandise, taking expected returns into account."
"Reference to related disclosures
With regard to the accounting policies applied for the recognition of merchandise revenue, we 
refer to the company’s disclosures in notes 3.5.5 (Accounting policies) and 3.5.7 (1) (Revenue) 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Write-downs on existing excess 
stocks are calculated as of the reporting date and recognized in the annual financial 
statements."
"Zalando’s executive directors calculate excess stocks based on the expected future sell-
through for various sales channels and seasons."
"Future sell-through and the resulting 
estimated net realizable values are based on planning assumptions subject to judgment, which 
are determined using figures observed in the past."
"We consider the subsequent measurement of merchandise inventory to be a key audit matter 
due to the high volume and heterogeneity of merchandise as well as the judgment used in 
calculating excess stocks and estimating the future net realizable value."
"Auditor’s response
We evaluated the compliance of the accounting policies Zalando’s executive directors applied 
in calculating the merchandise inventory and the timely recognition of write-downs with the 
requirements of IAS 2 (Inventories)."
"We also analyzed the process used by Zalando’s executive 
directors regarding the subsequent measurement of merchandise and gained an 
understanding of the process steps."
"We used data analytics to test the main 
underlying input factors for determining the future sell-through rate per sales channel and 
examined significant deviations and irregularities in more detail and also verified their 
plausibility with the executive directors of the company."
"In addition, we reviewed the allocation 
to seasons and valuation groups as well as the classification of never-out-of-stock goods in 
the valuation model."
"In this context, we considered additional quality-determining features 
(“ABCD” and “never-out-of-stock” goods) separately."
"We developed expectations regarding 
write-downs to be recognized in the future based on this and compared them with the write-
downs calculated and recorded according to the valuation model."
"Furthermore, we verified the 
clerical accuracy of the valuation model."
"Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the subsequent measurement of 
merchandise inventory."
"Reference to related disclosures
With regard to the accounting policies applied for the subsequent measurement of 
merchandise revenue, we refer to the company’s disclosures in notes 3.5.5 (Accounting 
policies) and 3.5.7 (16) (Inventories) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Other information
The Supervisory Board is responsible for the report of the Supervisory Board."
"In all other respects, the executive 
directors are responsible for the other information."
"The other information comprises the parts 
of the annual report mentioned in the appendix to the auditor’s report."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report 
do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any 
other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in 
this regard."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for 
assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility 
for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible 
for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an 
intention to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to 
do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the group’s financial reporting process for 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group 
management report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
assurance work."
"The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control."
"—
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and 
the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions."
"Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future 
events or conditions may cause the group to cease to be able to continue as a going 
concern."
"—
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business activities within the group to express opinions on the consolidated 
financial statements and on the group management report."

"We remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinions."
"—
Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial 
statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the group’s position it 
provides."
"—
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive 
directors in the group management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive 
directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of 
the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate 
opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a 
substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective 
information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where 
applicable, the related safeguards."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibility in 
accordance therewith is further described in the “Group auditor’s responsibilities for the 
assurance work on the ESEF documents” section."
"Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on 
Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1)."
"1 HGB and for 
the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 328 (1) 
Sentence 4 No."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the preparation of the ESEF documents 
as part of the financial reporting process."
"Group auditor’s responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free 
from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 
328 (1) HGB."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the assurance work."
"—
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF 
documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the 
effectiveness of these controls."
"—
Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file containing the 
ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, on the technical 
specification for this file."
"—
Evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML rendering with content 
equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited group 
management report."
"Further information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU audit regulation
We were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on May 24, 2023."
"We were

Zalando SE without interruption since fiscal year 2010."

financial Reporting in accordance with Sec."
315c in conjunction with Secs.
"289c to 289e HGB 
[“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and Art."
"These responsibilities of the Company’s executive directors include the selection and 
application of appropriate methods for the preparation of the non-financial Reporting and 
making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures that are 
reasonable in the circumstances."
"Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such 
internal control as the executive directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a 
non-financial Reporting that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
(manipulation of the non-financial Reporting) or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder contain wording 
and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which 
clarifications have not yet been published in every case."
"Therefore, the executive directors 
have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts 
adopted thereunder in section “Reporting on the EU Taxonomy Regulation” of the non-
financial Reporting."
They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation.
"Due to the 
immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity

"Responsibilities of the auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the non-financial 
Reporting based on our assurance engagement."

Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” issued by the IAASB."
"This standard requires 
that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about

non-financial Reporting is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Sec."
"315c

disclosed in section “Reporting on the EU Taxonomy Regulation” of the non-financial 
Reporting."
"Not subject to our assurance engagement are other references to disclosures made 
outside the non-financial Reporting."
"In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a 
reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is 
obtained."
"The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of 
the auditor."
In determining the disclosures in accordance with Art.
"8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the 
executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms."
"Due to the immanent risk 
that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their 
interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to 
uncertainties."
