# Text-Classification-with-BERT

This Project is based on data and research created and done by Stammbach et al. (2023) in light of the Paper "Environmental claim Detection". 

This project aims to investigate how the number of environmental claims in the annual reports of DAX companies correlate with their actual environmental performance. For pursuing this goal, Logistic Regression and the BERT model are implemented to precisely recognizes environmental claims and compared. Subsequently, all sentences are extracted from the corresponding annual reports and categorized by the superior performing model (BERT). The advanced application for this model is set up to assess if there is a correlation between the number of environmental claims in their annual report and their actual sustainability rating.
